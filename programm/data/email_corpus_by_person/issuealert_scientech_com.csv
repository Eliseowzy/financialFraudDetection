December Issue webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Naturalgas Prices Hit Astonishing Highs Will Coal and Nuclear Benefit By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD According to a Dec report in the Wall Street Journal naturalgas prices which already had been rising all year shot up percent to an alltime high of per million BTUs on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange Today reports are circulating that spot prices at the Southern California border reached an astounding on Wednesday breaking the Daily Gas Price Indexs alltime record high of The sharp increases are viewed as a reaction to cold weather in the Northeast and forecasts of more to come Projections continue to indicate that naturalgas customers will see sharp increases in their heating bills very soon The current increase has result ed from a volatile mixture of rising demand and decreased supplies for natural gas which has driven up prices by a total of percent or more than since a year ago The uncertain future of naturalgas supplies may be a contributing factor to an unexpected resurgence of interest in coalfi red and nuclear power ANALYSIS Unfortunately we are starting to see real evidence of the projec ted rise in naturalgas prices just as temperatures start to take their downwa rd slope across most of the United States Two months ago the Department of Energy predicted that households using natural gas would see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills with prices rising about percent on average Weve actually been seeing the price increase since June of this year when naturalgas hit a thenunprecedented mark of per million BTUs At that time it was a shock to see those kinds of spikes for natural gas especially since the energy source is typically used mostl y in the wintertime for heating Yet now as we move into the coldest months of the season I project that the alltimehighs of to per million BTUs are something that might become all too common for the near term The Wall Street Journal article on the price spikes also reported that the American Gas Association estimated that as of Nov there were about trillion cubic feet of gas in storage This represented an percent decrease from the fiveyear average for that date The United States is mostly selfreliant when it comes to naturalgas supplies and as Ive discussed in previous columns the fact that a reported percent of federal lands has been placed off limits for naturalgas drilling certai nly adds to the concern about future supplies The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibited drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground Yet at the same time substitute forms of power generation such as coal and nuclear have been restricted or downgraded in favor of natural gas which has only exacerbated the current demand on supply EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years Certainly the public resistance toward nuclear power has been well documented which has thwarted any plann ed production of a new nuclear plant Ironically it seems to me that we now find ourselves at a crossroads in this industry that may in fact lead to a resurgence of coalfired and nucle ar power Especially in states such as Texas and Oklahoma which are very reliant on naturalgas supplies the current uncertainty about the availability of natural gas and reasonable prices poses a major dilemma Despite the recent trend of moving away from these two forms of power I can point to several developments indicating that the current predicament could creat e a forced reliance on these power substitutes First lets look at coal Its been widely postulated that coal is cheaper and easier to produce than natural gas and its supplies are certainly more abundant As recently as this year coal has accounted for about percent of the electricity produced in the United States although that majorityhold over power production has come under attack Emission requirements have forced many generators to shut down or minimize the use of their coalfired generating stations In fact a group of seven utilitiesAEP Cinergy Illinois Power Southern Indiana Gas Electric Southern Company and Tampa Electric Companyhave been hit with a lawsuit by the EPA claiming that they contributed to some of the most severe environmental problems facing certain parts of the United States Specifically the EPA has claime d that the utilities violated the Clean Air Act with emissions from their coalfired power plants Currently while naturalgas prices have soared coal prices have remained comparatively low and stable In addition clean coal technologies are being put into place to reduce the amount of particulates released from coalfired plants As a result many generating companies are hedging their bets that the rise in natural gas prices will continue by maintaining or increasing their coalfired generation For example AEP is the nations leading consumer of coal Reportedly about percent of AEPs electric generation is made at coalfired plants In response to the naturalgas price spikes AEP confirmed that it will continue to operate all of its coalfired plants at full capacity despite the ongoing lawsuit from the EPA Proponents of coal are using the socalled natural gas crisis as an opportunity to argue that electricity from coal can be provided at about half the cost of other fossil fuels and is less costly and more reliable than intermitten t power sources such as wind and solar In addition coal proponents say that the cost of electricity would double if the United States were to replace all existing coalgenerated power plants with alternative forms of power Nuclear power also could stand to benefit from the comprised supplies and high prices of natural gas Following the growing interest among several European and Asian countries several US utilities have expressed recent interest in expanding their nuclear assets Corbin McNeill cohead of Exelon Corp on Monday stated that new nuclear plants are needed and one will definitely be built in the next five to years McNeill also noted that the question of whether a new nuclear plant was built would depend on a sustained increase in prices for natural gas which remains the curren t fuel of choice for new power plants However he rejected the notion that building new nuclear plants would require the Energy Departments Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository to be operational an event that probably wont happen until Entergy is another example of a company that continues to aggressively pursue nuclear power and may spark other companies to do the same in respon se to high naturalgas prices In late November Entergy announced that it would submit a counteroffer for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant which is already in the midst of being sold to rival buyer AmerGen Energy the joint venture between Exelon and British Energy Entergy which has been developing a strong nuclear platform for some time believes that the Northeastern United States offers a strong market potential for nuclear power and plans to increase its offer for the Yankee plant and trump AmerGens standing offer of million The next few months especially as temperatures continue to drop should be very telling on two counts First will we continue to see the recordbreaking prices for natural gas I say yes Second what impact will these price spikes have on coal and nuclear I think they should only have a positive impact on future development of these two forms of power However the question is whether or not new production of coal and nuclear can be put into place fast enough to minimize the potentially disastrous impact from the low supplies and resultant rising prices of natural gas Only time will have the answer to these questions

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Allegheny Energy Solutions an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy Inc has added Siemens Solar Industries LP to its growing portfolio of suppliers for distributed generation products Through its new agreement with Siemens Solar Industries Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions called earthsafe v The systems are suited for industrial commercial an d residential applications The new partnership further advances Alleghenys strategy of becoming a national energy supplier ANALYSIS This partnership comes on the heels of Alleghenys recently announced agreement to purchase three gasfired merchant plants from Enron North America Both deals reaffirm Alleghenys intent to expand its geographic footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability In my opinion Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further ed very aggressive generation expansion plans this year announcing one acquisition or development after another The company has added seven new offices in the northeastern United States over the last year and has disclosed that it will open new offices in the Southeast in to begin preparing for the albeit slow move to competition in that region The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its service offerings Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens portfolio of companies specializing in high and medium voltage protection and substation control systems power and distribution transformers system planning and decentralized energy supply systems Siemens Solar claims to be the number one provider of solarpower solutions in the world having shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of MW The company has been in business for about years and reached a mileston e of MW in Thus the company has doubled its production output in just four years Siemens Solar offers an array of solarrelated products As noted Alleghen y Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemens earthsafe platform which accord ing to information on Siemens Website is offered in four models ranging in DC power from watts to watts The earthsafe system consists of solar modules universal roof mounting kits DCAC inverters and interconn ect hardware The intent is that businesses and residences would install the earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs the remainder supplied by more traditional means and contribute to the efforts of reduci ng emissions from fossil fuel plants Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that the addition of the Siemens product to its service offerings positions it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer a complete onsite power solution I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly diversifies the companys service offerings Although the jury is still out regarding the profitability of solar power along with other forms of distributed and renewable energy sources for Allegheny the move makes sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy solutions Allegheny Energy Supply where most of the generation expansion efforts of its parent are focused develops competitive generation solution s eg cogeneration green power etc for a variety of end users Within the last year Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving from a regional player into a national energy supplier resulting primarily from its success in the strong Northeast market This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation on the part of the unregulated company Earlier this year Allegheny Energy Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energys Mitchel l Power Station in New Eagle Pa Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent company This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine in the Northeast The diversification of Alleghenys generation arsenal is also important because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors Allegheny must surely know that companies like Dominion Reliant and AESjust to name a feware also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar eas across the country Thus by adding diverse power options to its service offerings Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its energy supply packages I observed several months ago that Allegheny was probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani es that are strong in generation This partnership with Siemens seems to indic ate that distributed generation including solar power could become that niche As a sidenote Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard Poors Index earlier this week So the announcement that the company is diversify ing into solar power comes at a time when as CEO Alan Noia puts it our stron g growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance have received recognition The SP Index is widely regarded as the standard for measuring largecapitalization US stock market performance As of yesterday Dec Allegheny Energys stock NYSE AYE was priced at The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens not Allegheny Energy Solutions Competition among companies that develop products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late and there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability of this market One direct competitor to Siemens that Ive tracked recently is Evergreen Solar a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts in half the required use of silicon which is needed for most solarpo wer technologies Evergreen Solar which recently became a publicly traded company has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and that it may never become a profitable company The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries so the compan y may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power units This is of course an issue for Siemens and not Allegheny to address Under its partnership with Siemens Allegheny attains all the value of solar power technologies and little of the risks Thus this appea rs to be a smart venture for Allegheny and one that should strongly benefit its power supply opportunities

Issue at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml Not just news analysis Miss last week Catch up on the latest analyses of the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Backers of a plan to create a publicly owned power system in San Francisco and Brisbane Calif got a financial boost recently with a panel approving in taxpayer money to study public power and related issues Most of the money will be used to study how the proposed municipality district would work and how it would be financed The Board of Supervisors Finance Committee approved the spending but put of the money on reserve pending the selection of contractors to perform the study and determine the scope of the work ANALYSIS This news item circulated about two weeks ago but it still deser ves attention as this could have tremendous impact on PGE The announcement of the municipalization study comes at arguably the worst possible time for PGE as the utility already faces a multitude of financial and public relations problems Yet in fact the issue has been developing for several months Back in July supporters of municipalization in PGEs service territory turned in a petition with signatures calling for the creat ion of a municipal utility district meaning that electric service would be provided by a city rather than an investorowned utility First let me provide some brief context regarding PGEs current condition The utility is in debt of over billion due to uncollected fees related to the price spikes of last summer PGEs objective is to bill its custome rs for this debt and toward that end has petitioned to raise its rates with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC Under PGEs plan average residential monthly bills reportedly would increase from about to on Jan Naturally consumer activist groups such as TURN that carefully monitor PGEs every move have contested the rate increase arguing that the utility alone is responsible for the debt it currently faces Since it is uncertain if the CPUC will grant PGEs petition speculation that the utility will become financially insolvent has begun to grow Both San Francisco and the smaller city of Brisbane to the south are includ ed in the study because municipalization must include two separate cities in order to take effect If municipalization is ultimately approved these two cities would form a new district and elect directors who would then attempt to purchase PGEs power grid in the area Proponents of the muni bypass effort say that the cities can provide less expensive power to customers than PGE as the utility must pay dividends to stockholders and compensate wellpaid executives PGE has already start ed damage control in response to the study arguing against the formation of a municipal utilities district First the utility has said simply that it is not for sale but more importantly it is PGEs contention that customers would not necessarily save money if the cities in question were to municipalize their electric districts In addition PGE says the cost for the cities to buy its assetsnecessary power plants utility lines and other infrastructurewould run about billion which in fact would make the project more expensive in the long run for customers Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield is spearheading the municipalization effort and is using the problems in San Diego as a means to support his case His name may sound familiar as Rosenfield has been involved in many seemingly antiinvestor owned utility IOU measures in California Back in Rosenfield led the fight for Proposition which would have essentially put a screeching halt on deregulation in the state Although Prop was ultimately defeated at the ballot had it passed the measure would have stopped the three California IOUs from charging customers for the costs associated with billion in bonds they had sold to pay for the percent rate cut that customers began receiving in January Prop would have blocked the utilities from recouping any of their stranded costs which of course SDGE has now accomplished and reportedly the other IOUs SCE and PGE are close to doing so as well Rosenfield was a key particip ant in Californians Against Utility Taxes CUT which lobbied repeatedly for electric rates to be reduced by percent for small consumers as opposed to the percent that was included in the states restructuring bill Along with this study related to specific cities there reportedly is a simultaneous movement from Governor Gray Davis for a state takeover of the power transmission grid power plants and governmentsponsored construction of new generating plants In early December an internal memo was leaked indicating that the governor was considering these measures as a response to the tight supplies and high prices seen in San Diego last summer Includ ed in the plan would be a restructuring of the states power system wherein the grid of transmission lines and power plants would be placed under state control Among several points on which PGE and the governor disagree Davis has proposed an extended rate freeze for customers of all of the three states IOUs While PGE is pushing for a rate increase Californias highest official reportedly would implement an indefinite rate freeze that would further complicate PGEs plan to pull itself out of debt Municipalization attempts in cities across the United States have increased over the last two decades Just last week the city of Hermiston Ore was granted the right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilit ies that Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The Umatilla County Circuit Court has upheld the city of Hermistons right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilities Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The city has been trying to acquire those facilities since with the intent of forming its own utility to serve the commercial and residential customers now served by Pacific Power Of course even though this is a significant ruling it will remain embroiled in court for some time A jury trial to set the dollar amount of compensation for Pacific Powers facilities wont start until March Other wellpublicized municipalization attempts have taken place in Lakewood NY failed and a number of cities across Florida However despite the rise in muni bypass efforts the fact remains that no contested municipalization effort of any significant size has been successful since the one that occurred in Massena NY back in At that time the city of Massena offered lowcost hydropower and taxfree financing which made the municipalization attempt beneficial to citizens Today cities rarely can offer such advantages which had made it difficult for muni bypass efforts to succeed Statistics show that when given the option to develop a cityrun electric system by dissolving the incumbent utilitys authority citizens across the country have chosen to retain the IOU model Of course arguments could be made that in such cases the IOU lobbying force has been a formidable component wielding the capital necessary to wage a successful campaign to protect its business Yet at the same time a case can be made that the benefits of municipalization just have not been proven and that explains why citizens generally have opted to retain the IOU model There is both good and bad news for PGE related to this particular study The bad news is that studies such as these most often recommend municipalization which makes it very difficult for local politicians to resist a takeover In other words because the wheels have started turning toward municipalization in the area it is more than likely that PGE will have to engage in a battle to preserve its business Even though past history shows the attempt probably would not be successful if PGE contests it the bypass effort would result in PGE spending a lot of money and time to fight the effort The good news is that time is on the utilitys side Municipalization is usually a long and involved process The fact that the Finance Committee gave the green light to proceed with the study is only the first in many regulatory checkpoints The next steps are the full boards consideration of the funding request for the study and subsequently a decision whether or not to put municipalization on the local ballot Then the hard campaigni ng would begin to sway public opinion one way or the other Thus even if muncipalization of the two cities were to occur PGE still has some time to potentially resolve its debt situation and construct a strong opposition to the muni attempt However from a public relations standpoint this is just the last thing that PGE needs at this point The utility continues to spin media coverage to convey that it is only trying to recoup a debt that it accrued on behalf of its obligation to serve customers Adversaries such as TURN and Harvey Rosenfield however are just as aggressively working to convince the publi c that PGE is trying to unfairly stick customers with a billion tab To now have discussions emerge about whether or not city government could more effectively provide electric service is another fire that PGE will have to extinguish if it wants to remain operational

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

investmen t from PGE Find out more about SCIENTECHS ECommerce InfoGrid at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October TXU Sued By Texas Cities Over Franchise Fees By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The City of Denton Texas has filed a lawsuit against TXU Electric Gas claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid Denton its franchise fees by not accurately reporting its gross revenues on which franchise fees are based To date cities have signed resolutions to join Denton in the lawsuit and more are expected An initial audit by Denton claims that the amount that TXU owes could potentially exceed million ANALYSIS Over this last year several utilities in Texas have come under fire for allegedly not paying the full amount of franchise fees for which various cities claim they are obligated This suit against TXU is just the latest but it follows a judgment against Reliant Energy earlier this spring and a pending suit against CPL a subsidiary of AEPCSW Franchise fees are essentially rental payments that a city has the right to charge a utility for use of the citys public streets and grounds for the placement of pipelines poles and utility cables Texas state law allow s cities to charge utilities percent of their gross revenues for the right to franchises within a citys limits Some utilities such as Reliant entere d into agreementsstretching back to the sthat obligate them to pa y percent of gross revenues earned in a city in exchange for year franchises In any case the cities are arguing that franchise fees should be based on gross revenue not net revenue that the utilities have earned from providing service within the city limits Herein lies the core of the litigation as in this case the City of Denton is claiming that TXU intentionally reported lower gross revenue thereby reducing the amount it was required to pay to Denton and the other cities involved in the lawsuit The cities involved in the suit claim they are entitled to not only unpaid franchise fees from TXU but punitive damages as well The prognosis may not be very good for TXU if a similar case against Relia nt Energy is any indication In May a Houston jury ruled that ReliantHLP acted with malice by intentionally underpaying cities for decades for the exclusive right to sell electricity in those cities The state distric t court ordered HLP to pay million to the cities of Pasadena Galvesto n and Wharton The award consisted of million in punitive damages anothe r million because it was determined that HLP had defrauded the cities and million in actual damages That seemed to be just the start of Reliants problems as following that case additional cities including Houston came together and launched a classaction suit against Reliant HLP again claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid franchise fees for the sole right to provide power in the cities This lawsuit is claiming million in damages the bulk of which million is allott ed for the City of Houston However illustrating how polarized this issue is just last week a state district judge overturned the million ruling for the first three cities and reduced the damages down to million In addition the same judge overturned the separate ruling that had given the green light for the cities to proceed with the classaction suit Both rulings are still being appealed by the cities in hopes to reinstate the award for fraud and punitive damages In addition the cities involved in the new lawsuit against Reliant are proceedingjust with individual cases instead of one Sound confusing It certainly is and it will no doubt amount to one big mess if the cities are not permitted to band together in one classaction suit Heres Reliants position in the litigation which is presently supported by the Texas State District Court Reliant claims that transactions that do not generate profits or represent the selling of power in a citysuch as reconnection fees renting pole space to other utilities and sending electricity to other marketsshould not be considered part of gross reve nue and therefore not subject to franchise fees Thus the figure Reliant reported as gross revenue may indeed be lower than the cities expected it to bebut it is an accurate number based on Reliants interpretation As noted CPL is also involved in a pending lawsuit with the City of San Juan Texas and a group of about other cities These cities claim that CPL underpaid franchise fees and seek damages of up to million plus attorneys fees CPL has filed a counterclaim for overpayment of franchise fees and intends to defend itself against the cities claims How all of this will impact the case against TXU is unclear but certainly the momentum is growing against the utilities in Texas TXU like Reliant and CPL maintains that it has done nothing wrong and that it has paid in full all of the fees owed to the over Texas cities and towns to which it provides electric service Again the center of the dispute lies in how to calculate gross revenues TXU contends that gross revenue include s only the direct proceeds it has received from the sale of electricity and natural gas The City of Denton on the other hand argues that gross reven ue also should include other income such as taxes and fees collected for bad checks which conceivably could result in a much higher figure especially when calculated over a year period TXU had operating revenues of approximately billion so like Reliant a settlement in the million range would not wield much financ ial impact However more important to these utilities may be the fact that this could be just the beginning of a string of similar lawsuits brought forward by cities across Texas Consider the class action suit against Reliant to the tune of million If that suit is allowed to proceed were talking about big money especially when attorney fees are added to the equation In addition the reputation of these utilities is at stake The cities initiating the lawsuits are using such terms as unlawful busine ss practices and claiming that every dollar utilities like TXU and Reliant have not paid to the cities means a dollar increase in taxes for citizens As deregulation continues to unfold a utilitys reputation will be one of the foundations on which it attracts new customers and retains current ones Its also important to note that under Texas restructuring law once competition begins in the state January the formula to determine franchise fees in the state will switch from a revenue formula to a consumption formula In other words the amount that utilities collected as gross revenue in will be divided by the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed within the city limits during the same year and that will be the amount of the franchise fee owed by utilities to cities The franchise fee shall be equal to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours delivered within the city limits Of course all of these pending lawsuits are bringing into question the amount of gross revenue that was collected during which might make this formula difficult to calculate In any case I dont see these issues subsiding any time soon as they are based on a fundamentally different interpretation of how to define gross revenue The real winners in these lawsuits may be the attorneys themselves as undoubtedly these cases will remain in litigation for several years

our interview with a leader in the industy webinfostorensfProductsPowerHitter DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Toronto Hydro Ontario Power Generation Launch EBT Express By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they have launched an electronic business transaction EBT hub that will provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services to local distribution companies LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario Called EBT Express the exchange will become operational when Ontarios new competitive electricity market opens next spring Excelergy eXACTv developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation will provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express ANALYSIS This is a significant development as EBT Express represents the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions The site will serve as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario and possibly throughout Canada I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur Exelergys vice president Canada about EBT Express Caraghiaur believes that the site will provide the essential technology for opening Ontarios electrici ty market in an efficient manner That is no small undertaking as there are an expected players that will need to communicate with each other in Ontario once competition begins Deregulation is happening in Canada on a provincebyprovince basis much like it is happening statebystate in the US Thus far only Ontario and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select a new energy supplier Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next spring and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be operational Alberta uses a pointtopoint transaction process which represents a very complex model Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be clearly seen and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta and elsewhere The Ontario Energy Board OEB which is the equivalent of a state PUC mandated the use of electronic business transactions EBTs The EBTs work as follows Once a customer selects a new energy supplier the energy suppl ier and the local distribution company LDC must continue to share information about that customer This proprietary data shared strictly on a onetoone basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only will include billing usage and payment information Essentially an LDC will read the meter and send usage information to the energy supplier who will calculate its portion of a customers bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC which will submit the customer bill This represents a common way for billi ng in Ontario although there are other options including consolidated billing that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from both the LDC and energy supplier No customer information will be exchanged until competition officially begins in Ontario which now appears to be in the spring of although the technology infrastructure supplied by Excelergy is already in place In response to the OEBs mandate Toronto Hydro Corp and Ontario Power Generationthe largest players in electricity distribution and generatio n in Ontario became equity partners in the million joint venture to create EBT Express All customer data will be contained within EBT Express which is supported by the eXACT technology Excelergy eXACT is a software solution that translates validates manages and delivers data exchanged among users The functionality of eXACT has been used in several US state s including Pennsylvania and New Jersey In fact eXACT was introduced to gas and electricity retailers in the United States in as a component of Excelergy ABPv a billing and customer information solution Alleghen y Energy Supply a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy was one US utility that I know of that used the Excelergy technology Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci ng the competitive market in Ontario There are presently licensed retaile rs in Ontario pending retailers and LDCs Caraghiaur told me You can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express The numbe r of LDCs seemed awfully high to me but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario many LDCs serve only a small number of customers often customers or less This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in Ontario but when compared to the United States Ontario still will have a comparatively high number of distribution companies Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried to assimilate communication among many market participants Pennsylvania along with most other US states still uses electronic data interchange EDI as its standard wherein every LDC has a slightly different interpretation of data that is shared through the EDI This can often cause communication inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready for deregulation EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards says Caraghiaur The use of XML in particular will enhance communication between market participants In fact XML extensible market language is the cornerstone of eXACT as it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but still understood by different applications Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg y is on the forefront of XML technology which was expressly stipulated in the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy Board XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible In addition Excelergys eXACT software is objectoriented allowing for easy and rapid change from one program to another Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry Whereas states that previously deregulated such as California and Pennsylvania did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information states and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them For instance Excelergys competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse built for the Midwest market Also the ERCOTISO has teamed with Andersen Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling scheduled for pilot in the summer of and full market opening in Januar y One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer data through EBT Express especially when it is backed by potential competitors in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power Caraghiaur responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer information through an EBT structure However market participants are not mandated to participate in EBT Express They could opt to still exchang e information on a pointtopoint basis although Caraghiaur believes that EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer data In addition Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC and energy supplier involved in the exchange Interestingly Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when the Ontario market opens next year Toronto Hydro Corp owns Toronto HydroElectric System Limited a regulated electricity distribution system and Toronto Hydro Energy Services a competitive energy service company Ontario Power Generation is an electricity generating company so Toronto Hydro and Ontar io Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply contra cts with lucrative customers And rumor has it that venerable retail giant Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada next year As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market

latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

Take on Challenges Opportunities of Being Wirecoms at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Enron Offers to Buy Out Azurix By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Enron Corp announced that it has offered up to million in funding to take Azurix Corp NYSE AZX private at a buyout price of per share Enron owns directly and indirectly about percent of Azurix a global water company that owns operates and manages water and wastewater assets and provides related services The specific structure and timing of Enrons proposal has yet to be determined but the companys board is now consideri ng the proposal ANALYSIS Azurix has been plagued with operational and financial problems over the last months culminating in the departure of its former CEO Rebecca Mark in late August Enron had established Azurix in July with a billion acquisition of Britains Wessex Water which provides water and wastewater services to a UK population of approximately million Operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America Argentina and Brazil Azurix was intended to be Enrons vehicle to capitalize on what it perceived to be favorable market conditions for water investments Yet Azurix has not been a profitable operation for Enron and has been seen as a real anomaly when compared against Enrons consistent success in its other ventures for example EnronOnline For instance Azurix reported yearend net income of million significantly under projections for what Enron had hoped for the subsidiary After months of speculation Mark stepped down both as Azurix CEO and from the Enron board of directors and was replaced by John Garrison Jr Mark maintained throughout her tenur e as CEO of Azurix that the company needed time to develop core assets and capabilities However this approach was in stark contrast to Enrons guidi ng philosophyas espoused by COO Jeffrey Skillingwhich has moved the co mpany away from owning hard assets Skilling also believed that although acquiri ng the Wessex operation gave Azurix the engineering capability and industry knowledge to participate in the water business privatization of the water industry has slowed down considerably since the company began to penetrate this market Instead of pursuing a capitalintensive strategy for Azurix Skilling wanted Azurix to become more of a serviceoriented business This change in business direction coincided with the departure of Mark Yet Azurix has continued to flounder even since Mark left In the third quarter of this year Enron reportedly lost million in its corporate and other category and attributed a fourth of the loss to the Azurix operation Azurixs stock price started a marked decline in early August when it was announced that annual results would not meet analysts expectations While Azurix was taken public in June at a price of per share it curren tly is priced at at close of the markets on Oct This is an approximately increase from what Azurix had been trading at recently presumably due to Enrons announcement of the proposed buyout Enrons buyout offer comes after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix Reportedly three out of the four potenti al buyers were unwilling to pay more than per share although one of the buyers initially considered an offer of per share but ultimately decide d against the purchase Enrons motivation in returning Azurix to a private status is probably one of protecting its shareholders Enron pointed out in its announcement that shareholders would receive on a timely basis a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price of the shares at which Azurix has traded over the last several months Making matters worse for Enron a group of plaintiffs represented by New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian Feffer LLP have initiated a classaction lawsuit against Azurix in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas The plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all investors who purchased Azurix stock during the period of June the date of Azurixs IPO and Aug and who suffe red damages as a result The law firm is claiming that Azurix violated the Federal securities laws I placed a call to the law firm this morning in hopes of getting additional information about what the classaction suit entails Unfortunately I did not receive a call back before press time The consensus among the vast majority of US energy companies is that the profitability of water as a convergence strategy is questionable The most obvious negative about the water business is that it most likely will remain a heavily regulated delivery business offering few opportunities for private companies to penetrate the market Water is a very staid busine ss that seems inconsistent with Enrons aggressive growth strategy After Enron secures a fair return for Azurixs shareholders it is not clear what the company will do with its water subsidiary but I would not be surprised if Azurix is sold to another company However in Augustright before Marks departureAzurix announced that it had begun a pilot progr am in the Lower Rio Grande using its Internet exchange WaterWatercom The site will provide users with information price transparency and efficiency in water exchanges This announcement indicated that Azurix would begin trading water rights adding this commodity to the growing list of Enrons traded commodities energy telecom weather derivatives etc So it may be the case that Enron keeps Azurix but turns it into a water trading operation as opposed to water and wastewater services In any case the present objective for Enron will be financing the buyout and ensuring that Azurixs shareholders receive a significant premium to the market price of Azurix Enron also wants to ensure other benefits to Azurix including a significant nearterm reduction in Azurixs general and administrative expenses greater certainty to Azurixs customers and employees and increas ed flexibility for restructuring Azurixs

Sing Some Utilities Take on Challenges Opportunities of Being Wirecoms at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November NiSource and Columbia Energy Group Complete Merger By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD NiSource Inc and Columbia Energy Group received approval for their merger from the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and are expected to close their transaction today The combined company will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as NiSource NYSE NI Columbia Energ y Group shares NYSE CG will cease trading before the market opens Nov ANALYSIS Its been a long and rocky road to say the least for the billion marriage between these two companies which reportedly will create the largest US naturalgas distributor east of the Rocky Mountains The union started out as a hostile takeover in June when NiSource began making several attempts to purchase all outstanding common shares of Columb ia Energy Group CEG All of NiSources offers were rejected by CEG In fact up until just a year ago CEG fiercely fought the takeover claiming that due to financial and operational problemsNiSource was not an appropriate ma rriage partner However after about eight months of offers and rebuffs with NiSource offering as much as a share Columbia Energy Group finally consented to the billion offer ironically based on Columbias February stock value of a share and consequently lower than NiSources previous offers The merger creates a company that could gain a strong lock on the naturalg as market in a corridor stretching from Texas to Maine Merrillville Indbas ed NiSource is a holding company parent company to NIPSCO and Bay State Gas among several other distribution companies with operations in electric naturalgas and water distribution in the Midwest and Northeastern United States Its generation portfolio includes four coalfired generating statio ns two hydroelectric generating plants and four gasfired combustion plants NiSource also markets unregulated energy services in key competitive areas CEG based in Herndon Va is an energy services company with assets of approximately billion and ownership of miles of interstate gas pipelines that run from Louisiana to the Northeast CEG is engaged in nearl y all aspects of the naturalgas business including exploration and producti on transmission storage and distribution as well as propane and petroleum product sales and electric power generation Under the terms of the merger agreement NiSource is offering shares for each Columbia common share CEG shareholders can elect to receive New NiSource stock or receive a combination of in cash plus in securities Just today NiSource revised its estimate of the number of CEG shares elect ing to receive NiSource stock upward to approximately percent from its origi nal estimate of percent Regarding current stock performance NiSource share s closed on Oct not far from a week high of Shares of CEG closed at Upon completion of the merger the companies will create a new holding company as of yet unnamed under which NiSource and CEG will become wholly owned subsidiaries Together the companies will serve approximately million customers The companies have identified their postmerger strategy as growth in energy supply and distribution as well as the development of new energy choices through emergent technologies The regulatory approval process for the NiSource CEG merger went comparatively smoothly finishing just eight months after the formal announcement of the merger Yet the SEC gave its approval to the merger on an important condition Under the laws of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of PUHCA the SEC has required NiSource to divest of IWC Resources its water operations subsidiary based in Indianapolis Under PUHCA utility holding companies are required to divest operations that are not integral to their primary operations The divestiture must take place within three years to comply with US legislation according to NiSource Although the merger is small in comparison to recent megamergers between AEP CSW and PECO Unicom this partnership is important Its not surprising that NiSource pursued CEG so diligently as the acquisition of CEG more than doubles the size of NiSource and changes it from a predominantly elect ric company to a gas transmission and distribution company with electric operations NiSource will own a naturalgas business extending from Chicago to New England reportedly placing it as the nations thirdlargest naturalgas company largest in the West The completion of the merger comes at an ideal time for NiSource just as reports of a shortage in naturalgas suppl y indicate that the prices for natural gas will rise significantly this winte r and into next year As a leading supplier NiSource will be sitting in a prime position However the divestiture of IWC Resources is a clear downside to this merge r at least from NiSources point of view Of all the players that have penetrated the water industry and then retreated for example Enron and Duke NiSour ce was one of the few that stood out as having some success in this heavily regulated market In fact up until recently NiSource had claimed that its growth strategy was to build a distribution chain around the core naturalgas electricity and water distribution businesses More than being a significan t money maker for the company NiSources water business provided a steady cash flow and perhaps more importantly access to additional energy customers Water customers as an aggregated group can be very valuable for an energy company The company that controls water services has another stable base of customers to which it can sell electric and gas services For instance NiSource had purchased IWC in part to prevent its competitor IPALCO Enterprises from obtaining the water customer list in this service territory The bottom line of this merger may be that while other companies are focus ing on building critical mass the New NiSource is carving out a specific niche naturalgas services in a targeted market Texas to Northeast The fact that it will no longer own IWC Resources may pale in comparison to the projected growth that the New NiSource may find in the naturalgas business Of particular importance to this new company is the ownership of miles of interstate gas pipelines gained from CEG Owning a significant supply of natural gas in a very tight market may become the real secret advantage of this merger DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more

Bullock CoFounder President and CEO of Excelergy is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November FERC Proposes Major Changes to Californias Wholesale Market By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a draft order outlin ing a major overhaul of the California wholesale market including changes to market rules concerning the California ISO CalISO and Power Exchange PX Conceding that the market rules and structure for wholesale sales of electricity are flawed and have caused unjust and unreasonable rates FERC has proposed a number of remedies that will become effective in approximately days The full commission is expected to vote on the draft order in December after a period of industry comment ANALYSIS FERC based its page draft order on several assumptions and through the order intends to offer longterm rather than bandaid solutio ns First FERC wants to hold overall rates to competitive levels that benefit consumers while at the same time induce sufficient investment in capacity to ensure adequate service Second FERC acknowledged that some matters that have adversely impacted the California wholesale market are not under its jurisdiction but that of the CPUC Thus FERC focused on matters withi n its exclusive jurisdiction even if some of the proposals preempt prior state decisions while at the same time urging the state of California to rectify issues within its own jurisdiction This is an important point as FERC maintains that unless the CPUC addresses issues such as the inadequate siting of generation and transmission and demandside response California customers may still be exposed to higher prices that result from low supply Third FERC could find no evidence of market power abuses although it did concede that the market in California certainly allows the opportunity for market abuse when energy supplies are tight Further FERC contends that California IOUs have been bidding up to percent of their load into the dayahead market and hourahead spot markets creating substantial shortterm cost exposure Due to regulatory restrictio ns from Californias restructuring law AB the IOUs were not able to pursue a balanced portfolio including longterm and intermediate contracts The central mission of FERCs order is to remove the restrictions that kept California IOUs from moving significant amounts of wholesale transacti ons into forward markets The less reliant that the IOUs become on spot markets so goes FERCs theory the less chance of price volatilitywhich should not only reduce costs for customers but also increase reliability and increase prospects for new generation With that established heres what FERCs order prescribes Eliminate the requirement that Californias three IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE must sell into and buy from the PX This proposal essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers which was previously restricted under AB Require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead markets A penal ty charge will be affixed for deviations in scheduling in excess of percent of an entitys hourly load requirements Disbursement of penalty revenues will be distributed to the loads that scheduled accurately The establishment of independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the California ISO and PX The establishment of generation interconnection procedures FERC wants the CPUC to address the following issues delays in siting additions of generation and transmission capacity implementation of additional deman d response programs at the retail level and elimination of impediments on load serving entities pursuing power supplies on a forward basis Perhaps most contentious within the order is FERCs decision to set a MWh rate cap so that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing price that is paid to all bidders This policy negates a previous proposal from the CalISO under which it lobbied for a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market FERCs order freezes the ISO bid cap at its current level for the next days However beyond that FERC is instating what is being referred to as a soft price cap of MWh to remain in place until December Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generato r setting a bid above MWh must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny The order revealed again some dissension with the FERC itself Although generally the four commissioners that delivered the order Hoecker Massey Breathitt and Hbert probably would agree that it is not perfect Commissioner Hebert voiced the strongest disagreement with the orders principles Hber t hesitantly concurred with the order although he believed the commission went too far in its attempt to mitigate prices something he believes FERC is illequipped to do Specifically Hbert dissented with the decision to place any sort of price cap on wholesale transactions preferring instea d as he has advocated throughout his tenure as a FERC commissionerto entrus t market participants with the ability and responsibility to mitigate their price exposure as they deem best Moreover it is questionable whether or not FERC has achieved its goals of providing longterm solutions to Californias problems Rather it seems that the commission is sending a mixed message On one hand it is allowing the California IOUs the freedom to buy and sell power outside of the PX which seems like a very procompetition policy Yet on the other hand FERC establishes a price cap albeit a soft not hard one on wholesale transactions which arguably will continue to restrict true competitive market forces from materializing in California The commission is sending a clear signal that all bids should be under MWh and will undergo interrogation if they are not which essentially puts political pressure on suppliers to maintain a price cap However if one of the clear goals of this proposed order is to bring down energy prices for California customers removing the requirement of the IOUs to buy and sell through the PX may actually accomplish this The propo sal changes the California structure to one in which local distribution compani es LDCs could possibly wield more market power than the energy suppliers who essentially controlled prices when going through the PX If the LDCs know how to work economic deals in which they set the price for the power they purchase this could ultimately drive energy costs down for customers As noted FERC will vote on the proposed order in December after receiving commentary from industry participants FERC Chair James Hoecker already knows the position of one major player He received a letter from Enron CEO Kenneth Lay just this week in which Lay urged FERC to avoid placing price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay further predicted that installing price caps would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods and stated that a capped formula would encourage naturalgas suppliers to deploy their turbines in other states or countries In addition several consumer advocate groups have expressed anger that FERC did not order refunds for San Diego customer s who bore the brunt of high energy prices this summer In fairness to FERC it is questionable whether or not the commission has the legal authority to provide a refund to San Diego customers as it did not find any evidence of market manipulation Thus there is little chance that we will see the end of the debate over California any time soon Rather FERCs order which presents itself as a remedy to conflicts surrounding the wholesale market has shown just how polarized adversaries are within this debate Yet I believe the bottom line of the proposed order is that it is a good first step to addressing the fundamental problems within Californias wholesale market and marks a significant start to what will undoubtedly be an ongoing discussion DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD For additional background coverage of the problems related to the wholesale market in California please visit SCIENTECHs

Expo in Phoenix Arizona November Hear JON BROCK Director of Strategic and Competitive Intelligence SCIENTECHRCI address the ramifications of legislative and regulatory requirements on your Information Technology Infrastructure DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November AEP Restructures Moves Away from Distribution Focus By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Earlier this week AEP announced its plans to restructure into two companie s to support a new focus on power generation marketing and trading Our focus for moving forward plain and simple will be the wholesale business generation and related energy assets wholesale marketing and trading said Dr Linn Draper AEPs CEO Draper added that AEP has no plans to expand its utility distribution operations in the United States and overseas ANALYSIS First lets be clear about what AEP is doing Under the restructuring one corporation will hold AEPs utility and nonutility subsidiaries whose revenues are derived from competitive unregulated business ventures The second corporation will hold AEPs utility subsidiaries primarily TD subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by at least one state regulatory commission or foreign subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs regulation This announcement represents a degree turn from what AEP has previously espoused as its competitive strategy both during and after the recent completion of its merger with CSW Its not so surprising that AEP would want to focus on generating marketing and trading or separate its highri sk and lowrisk operations into two companies Whats most surprising about this restructuring is AEPs move away from the TD side of its business since up until a few weeks ago distribution remained a key part of AEPs core business strategy For instance when the merger with CSW was completed in June Draper said AEPs postmerger strategy consists of three key elements wholesale energy delivery and retail The two that will be most important for us initially are the wholesale and energy delivery businesses This made sense because as a combined company the new AEP owns more than miles of transmission lines and miles of distribution lines As recently as October this remained AEPs strategy Draper told me in an exclusive interview At least for the foreseeable future being in the distribution business is a good idea Were not going to make a fortune at it because rates are continually going to be regulated by state commissions but AEP is going to be in the wires business If anything Draper question ed whether or not AEP would remain in the retail business as he was unsure that AEP was skilled enough to succeed in this end of the business Thus this seemingly sudden decision to put no further emphasis on expandin g the TD operation is rather surprising We can speculate about the various reasons why AEP would be changing its path For starters unquestionably AEPs wholesale generation and trading business has grown considerably over the last two years According to figures released this week in AEPs Fact Book presented at the EEI Financial Conference earlier this week the companys trading volumes continue to increase Q reflects millionMWh compared to millionMWh in Q Thirdquarter figures were not yet available Regarding gross profits for the first six months of trading contributed million while wholesale marketing contributed million On the other hand the regulated TD business currently is characterized by both slow growth and a low rate of return Thus it would make little sense for AEP to continue to expand this part of its business as further expansion would bring little value to its shareholders This theory may be supported by the fact that Draper clearly stated the restructuring is focused on obtaining higher profit margins in the unregulated wholesale energy markets I confirmed this with a quick call to AEP yester day afternoon I was told by my contact there that from this point any discretionary cash is going into the wholesale side By splitting the companys operatio ns in two undivided attention can now be placed on growing the unregulated side of the business where AEPs sees the most growth for its operation For the most part separating its business into two companiesessentiall y one regulated and other unregulatedappears to be a smart move for AEP as the two business offer strikingly different risk portfolios The restructuring is part of a growing trend among companies that have scale on both the generation and TD sides and realize these two very different operations attract a different kind of investor Just recently Reliant Energy announc ed that it is initiating a similar restructuring separating into two publicly traded companies one regulated and one unregulated Reliants decision was motivated in part because of Texas mandate that utilities in the state must construct firewalls between their operating companies In other words Texas utilities must have separate companieswith separate financial rec ords for energy services distribution generation etc Yet beyond the mandate it is a smart move for Reliant because it can now attract two different sets of investorsone attracted to highrisk ventures and the other aver se to them In addition highrisk ventures such as power generation marketin g and trading telecom etc will not have a negative impact on the unregula ted companys stock value The same logic applies to the restructuring that AEP has announced Other companies that recently have spun off highrisk subsidiaries into separate companies are Southern Company Southern Energy and Xcel Energy NRG Energy Inc One difference between these examples and AEP is that AEP has not confirmed that its two companies will become two standalone publicly traded compani es Draper has said that the company is reserving that decision until the end of next year the time at which he believes the restructuring will have received all the necessary regulatory approvals considering how long the AEPCSW merger took to complete the restructuring could take longer than a year Draper did allude to the fact that AEP has a number of options to consider This statement may or may not support speculation that the company is planning an imminent acquisition one that might dramatically expand its generation portfolio and further support its trading and wholesa le marketing efforts In addition I think its valid to speculate that AEP might eventually divest itself of the TD business altogether Certainly the restructuring does not place this end of the companys business very high on the totem pole as it was only a few months ago Another question that probably cannot be answered at this point is whether or not AEP as a holding company will remain under regulation from the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of PUHCA After the restructuri ng has been completed AEP will have several options It could operate as it is now that is with a holding company structure under which the two standalone corporations would be held Or it could issue two IPOs for the two companies Assuming that after the restructuring has been completed AEP decides to issue IPOs for both its unregulated and regulated companies thereby eliminating a holding company entity it is questionable whether or not AEP would still be bound by PUHCA restrictions This could be an important part of AEPs strategy regarding the restructuring As AEP contin ues to compete in deregulated markets it faces an array of restrictions under PUHCA that for example Enron does not face as it is not a registered holding company Disengaging itself from PUHCA restrictions assuming that PUHCA has not been repealed by that point would certainly offer AEP a new level of competitive agility However perhaps most interesting of all will be what AEP decides to do with its TD business which represents approximately million customers that are connected to AEPs transmission system Certainly once this regulated business is fully separated from the deregulated businesses AEP will be able to do a more accurate costbenefit analysis and determine if it wants to remain in the TD business at all DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

this is the first event to bring the major energy companies net markets venture capitalists regulatory bodies investment banks and analysts together to thrash out why its not business as usual but business online For more information please visit wwweyeforenergycomxonline SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Evergreen Solar Inc Issues Successful IPO Do Alternative Fuels Increase Stock Value By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Waltham Massbased Evergreen Solar Inc Nasdaq ESLR issued an initial public offering of shares of its common stock at the IPO price of per share Evergreen Solar develops manufactures and markets solar power cells panels and systems throughout the world The IPO reportedly will raise million in gross proceeds to support further expansion and development by Evergreen Solar ANALYSIS Heres yet another case of a relatively unknown company going public based on grand marketing ideas rather than a solid track record Yet surprisingly the IPO has opened strong Last Thursday Evergreen Solars stock closed percent above its offering price at At the close of the market on Friday the stock price had dropped to but still represented a strong showing while other IPOs last week both energy and nonenergy have crashed and burned Excelergy for example What makes the strong IPO even more startling is Evergreen Solars lessthanstellar financial history Since its inception in Evergreen has incurred significant net losses million in million in and million for the first six months of As a result of ongoing operating losses Evergreen has a cumulative net loss of million as of June and has stated clearly that it expects to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable In product sales only accounted for percent of total revenue with the rest coming from research grants Granted Evergreen is still in startup mode with regard to a largescale production of its business but still it seems very odd to see such a strong IPO from a company that is really just getting started So what gives Doesnt it seem logical that a company should demonstrate financial stability before it goes public And that if its not financially stable the stock price should go down and not up Ill provide one theory but first lets establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about The companys sales since have been composed primarily of solar panels Evergreen plans to begin largescale manufacturing of its solar power products in a new manufacturing facility in early a growth strategy that the IPO proceeds obviously would support Evergreens principal objective is to become a leading producer of highquality solar power products primarily for the ongrid market and the offgrid rural electrification market What makes the company unique according to Evergreen is its String Ribbon technology which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon which is required for most solarpower technologies Evergreens String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half which reduces manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability In December Evergreen Solar formed a fiveyear strategic distribution and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market Essentially Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively through Kawasaki In fact the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreens business In the first six months of sales to Kawasaki accounted for approximately percent of Evergreens product revenues After the IPO Kawasaki will have an percent stake in Evergreen The risks associated with Evergreens business are formidable and the company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly revenue continues to be disappointing Beyond that Evergreens success hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market which is still in question Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies pointofuse electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the electric grid will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the global electric power market and within DG technologies solar power has experienced significant growth over the last years In addition solar power produces zero emissions and may grow as a result of renewable energy requirements in various states This may be true but at the same time there are other competing DG technologies such as fuel cells microturbines and wind power which may slow the grow of solar power Plus theres little proof that Evergreens String Ribbon technology will produce significant costsavings to make it a standout technology There are other risks as well not the least of which is the exclusive relationship with Kawasaki If the relationship goes sour this could dramatically diminish Evergreens potential revenues and market share So with this market profile the question of why Evergreen had such a strong IPO still remains I think the answer is that Evergreens business focus is exclusively placed on alternative power At a time when ecommerce stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success stocks based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that distributed generation technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years Commercial and industrial customers want various options that can reduce their dependence on the grid With regard to alternative fuels and distributed generation technologies investors may believe that either utilities or large endusers will begin to develop these technologies as deregulation continues Remember Active Power Nasdaq ACPW whose shares soared on expectations that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology On its opening day in August Active Power stock increased by percent from the opening price of to Although Active Powers stock price has bounced around since then it still closed at on Nov a very respectable level and approximately percent above its original price Another example is Capstone Turbine Nasdaq CPST which is currently trading at after opening at in June Along with alternative fuels venture capitalists also appear to be responding to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services to energy companies Then there is the growing market of exchanges such as Pantellos Enporion Enermetrix and the like which could be the next big round of successful IPOs The longterm question is how long such stocks can continue to open so successfully without having a strong financial performance to support the opening Ecommerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two ago but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded to see the money Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following a similar path which makes time a critical factor The bottom line is that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance or Lack Thereof of Information Technology in the Energy Industry By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the CEO Mega Panel View From the Top at the th annual EEIAGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc e in Phoenix this week The moderator was Charles Bayless former chairman president and CEO of Illinova The remaining three CEOs included Keith Stamm CEO Aquila Energy Dr Matthew Cordaro president and CEO Midwest ISO and James Pignatelli chairman president and CEO UniSource Energy ANALYSIS This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner The conference organizers did a good job in getting a crosssection of the energy industry in transition The trading organization specialist was represented with Aquila the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes t ISO and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource Energy Each panelist was asked what role information technology IT played in their respective organization Their answers may surprise you Dr Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first Dr Cordaro stressed that IT was very critical to the operation of an ISO saying it is essentially the foundation of the ISO He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions every week in a realtime operation Among the responsibilities that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are monitoring the congestion on the grid and taking appropriate action preventing gaming through market monitoring settlement processing who owes who what and handling the dispute process The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati on RTO Alliance on July of this year to deliver an integrated control center system ICCS that when complete will provide million in infrastructure for the MISO The RTO Alliance which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation of Seattle Open Access Technology International OATI of Minneapolis Perot Systems of Dallas Texas and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City Utah will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission The hardware and software in the ICCS project will support MISOs operational functions including transmission planning reservation scheduling realtime monitor ing and control settlement and billing Dr Cordaro also stated that Lodestar was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to ATT Solutions Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next Keith began by clarifying Aquilas focus as trading owning very little assets in a highvolume lowmargin highvolatility business IT is very important in the trading business Realtime information must be known and disseminated appropriately to the right individuals Keith believes that one of Aquilas strategic asset s and strengths is its risk management system Aquila strives for a realtim e calculation of risk Aquila Energy a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc has been a surprisin g winner in the trading marketplace this year showing a percent growth since last year with billion total revenue for the past six months of that million in trading revenue compared to million in The EBIT was million vs million a year ago Aquila has gathered top traders and intellectual financial and risk management personnel to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies including top traders AEP and Duke Energy as an investment step Aquila perceived was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin g platforms The Energy Trading Consortium Duke Energy AEP Aquila Energy Reliant Energy Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy is in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap benefits from the transaction cost liquidity volume and speed of exchange This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to onetomany Another competitor recently launched is eSpeeds TradeSpark James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial statements concerning information technology James stated that IT in the vertically integrated utility is not strategic at least not at the present time James believes that IT will become strategic someday in the deregulated market James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the IT arena He mentioned pulling in his IT folks and saying Lets switch the distribution network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances well switch back to AC While James comments may have been controversial with the more than attendees and approximately energy CIOs in the audienc e he does have a point The vertically integrated utilitys core strength is to generate power and distribute it to captive customers reliably While some IT systems like outage management and SCADA devices may be strategic in this sense the other parts of IT are questionable and could be candidates for outsourcing James claims to be working on BB and BC initiatives at the moment His vision for BC is a smart chip in the residence that has access to instantaneous pricing information The residence will buy electricity for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce load thereby reducing the TD utility to a simple conduit for service James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior to its sale to AES In Tucson Electric invested million in NEV and Charles Bayless then Tucson Electrics chairman president and chief executive officer and James Pignatelli Tucson Electrics senior vice president and chief operating officer served on New Energy Ventures administrative committee It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated IT systems If one were to stop and think about it deregulation could not occur without the complex IT systems that are employed today in the marketplace I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have thought about an unbundled electric marketplace It is in fact undoing their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational efficiency DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD See SCIENTECHs

Energy Issues By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD After a tumultuous Election Day full of constant changes in the projections the identity of the next president of the United States was still unknown as of Wednesday morning Nov The identity of the next US president will be determined by a vote recount in Florida which must be completed by the close of business Thursday state election officials said Tuesdays national vote count is so close as is the number of electoral votes won by GOP candidate George W Bush and Democrat Vice President Al Gore that the presidential election is too close to call It is also possible that one candidate could win the Electoral College vote and the other win the popular vote which hasnt happened in a hundred years ANALYSIS Well it certainly has been a historymaking Election Day I was prepared to analyze the future of the energy industry based on which presidential candidate had been elected yesterday As the candidates have such polarized platforms with regard to energy issues it is not an overestimation to say that many critical energy issues hinge on this election As we await the final and accurate announcement of who is the next US president which may not come for another day or so it is a good time to review how each candidate intends to address low domestic supplies of oil and natural gas the status of deregulation the development of renewable energy and the high cost of energy due to recent price spikes Throughout the campaign Bush criticized the ClintonGore Administration for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Rather than developing an effective energy policy Bush accused Gore of raising gasoline taxes discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas and failing to anticipate the oil and naturalgas price spikes that have occurred this year Bush also was very critical of President Clintons decision to tap into the Strategic Reserve Fund in September and release million barrels of crude oil from the nations emergency oil stockpile As the United States now enters a socalled energy crisis brought about primarily as a result of rising demand and diminishing supplies Bush has outlined an energy policy that includes more than initiatives I cant address all of them but have identified the key policies that will likely unfold under a Bush administration Perhaps the best summary of Bushs energy policy is that he supports a comprehensive approach to ensuring US energy security and intends to accomplish this by expanding domestic resources using a range of fuels and technologies supporting ongoing deregulation of the industry and providing energy assistance to lowincome households Reduce American dependence on foreign supplies of oil Bush repeatedly made the case that since US energy demand has more than doubled far outstripping domestic production Today the United States consumes approximately onethird of the worlds energy and approximately percent of our usage comes from foreign sources Bush contends that US dependence on foreign oil has increased from percent in to percent today and that oil imports are projected to increase to million barrels per day by To remedy this Bush supports the development of domestic sources for oil natural gas and renewable energy Specifically Bush has proposed opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to environmentally responsible and regulated exploration with the intent of replacing the oil that the United States now imports from Iraq Regarding natural gas Bush will examine whether certain promising naturalgas reserves in federal lands should be opened for exploration Yet its important to note that Bush is not suggesting that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will be sufficient Rather he recognizes that access to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States and the global economy However instead of relying predominantly on Iraq especially as Saddam Hussein threatens to reduce productionBush will work more clo sely with Canada and Mexico to increase crossborder flows of oil natural gas and electricity within North America Support new pipeline construction As domestic production of oil and natura l gas increases to meet growing demand Bush also supports the construction of new pipelines and would expand refining capacity by tearing down regulatory hurdles Bush has referenced the National Petroleum Councils estimates that the gas industry will require miles of new transmission pipelin es and miles of distribution lines by Bush sees a need for new pipelines and distribution lines in the Midwest in particular where traditional coal plants should ultimately be replaced by gasfired plants Support the growth of renewable energy Bush supports the development of renewable and lowemission fuels and has committed to investing billion over years to fund cleancoal technologies and billion over years to help utilities purchase nuclear plants At the same time Bush will propose legislation requiring utilities to reduce harmful emissions from their generation plants and offer tax credits for power produced from alternative or renewable fuels However Bush recognizes that while renewable energy is important it currently accounts for less than percen t of the total US energy consumption Consequently for the foreseeable future Bush contends that hydrocarbonsoil coal and natural gaswil l continue to play the primary role in meeting the growing energy needs of Americans Support electric deregulation Bush supports deregulation of the energy industry and prefers to let markets and not government officialsdeter mine investment decisions and give customers a choice of suppliers Toward this end Bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed to assure the reliability of the nations electrical grid and to promote consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition While he supports consumer choice Bush recognizes that often lowincome families face high electricity prices as was found in San Diego this summer Consequently Bush supports the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP the largest direct expenditure energy subsidy program which has about million left in funding to support emergency funding for cooling and heatin g assistance In addition Bush will expand the Weatherization Assistance Program which supports about homes by spending billion for Weatherization programs over the next ten years As noted the presidential candidates are proposing very different platform s with regard to the energy industry Thus it is not surprising that Vice President Gore disagrees with most everything that Governor Bush is proposi ng Essentially the most striking difference comes down to conservation While Bush supports the exploration of domestic fuels Gore believes the United States should focus on doing more with what we already have and protecting the environment for future generations Of course Gore carries the legacy of his ClintonGore administration one that as noted has been criticized by Bush for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Thus it is not completely clear how Gore would depart from what has been his administrations approach to energy issues over the last seven years It is likely that Gores administration would follow much the same path that the Clinton administration traveled although Gore certainly has made the environment one of his core platforms for example his book Earth in the Balance Thus is not surprising that creating a clean environment and stable climate is one of the key foundations on which Gore has established his energy platform Beyond that Gore has said that his new energy policy will focus on five goals Saving energy reducing pollution promoting a higher standard of living and creating highwage jobs Reducing the nations dependence on unreliable imported oil Protecting children against the threat of pollution nationally and globally Dramatically reducing the threat posed by global warming Curtailing brownouts by increasing the reliability of the power grid Perhaps the central initiative that Gore has proposed is the creation of the National Energy Security and Environmental Trust Fund Designed to bring revolutionary change to our transportation and energy infrastructure the Fund would help consumers purchase energyefficient vehicles homes and appliances promote clean and reliable sources of electric power and encourage longterm solutions to reduce US dependence on imported sources of oil Gore would provide consumers with a tax credit up to to purchase energyefficient new homes or up to a credit to upgrade the efficiency of their current homes Gore also supports expanding the current percent tax credit provided to homes or businesses that use solar energy to generate electricity or heat water Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the Unite d States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell save a million barrels of oil a day which is exactl y what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to deve lop fuel cells alternative energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve Gore supports tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund as Preside nt Clinton did in September to increase oil supplies prevent winter shortage s of home heating oil and stabilize oil prices Perhaps the only issue on which the two candidates agree is deregulation of the energy industry as a whole This process is of course occurring on a statebystate basis although many states have begun to resist competition due to current low prices in their states and fear of sudden price spikes as occurred in California this summer Bush clearly supports a national restructuring law while it unclear if Gore supports this as well or prefe rs to let states continue to deregulate on their own or opt out from this process One thing is clear in all of this uncertainty The future of the energy industry hangs in the balance and will continue in one of two drastically different directions as the final outcome of this election is determined As supply and demand issues continue to generate concern across the country it is certain that energy issues will remain on the radar of whichever candidate is elected president DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Standard Poors SP revised the outlook to negative from stable on the Midwest Independent Transmission System Midwest ISO SP also confirm ed its triple Bplus issues credit on the Midwest ISO the nonprofit independent corporation that will manage the operations of a portion of the transmissio n assets of utilities across a state region ANALYSIS This is the latest in a string of developments that has put into question the future of the Midwest ISO as the organization continues to sort through the recent announcements of two key members that have decided to depart The Midwest ISO was organized to ensure that energy suppliers are protected against price instability and discriminatory access to the transmission grid among other potential problems associated with grid management For those unaware of the terminology let me offer a brief explanation Under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERCs Order utiliti es that own control or operate transmission assets were essentially mandated to join a regional transmission organization RTO an umbrella term that can include a notforprofit ISO independent system operator forprofit transmission company transco or a hybrid of both models Although roundly considered the favorite ISO model by FERC the foundation of the Midwest ISO began to shake a bit when two founding members announced they were departing to join a competing RTO Commonwealth Edison ComEd announced just last week that it would be leaving the organization and joining the rival Alliance RTO a move it expects to complete by Dec ComEds announcement followed a similar decision last September by Illinois Power also a founding member to depart and join the Alliance RTO The Midwest ISO is a notforprofit model while the Alliance is a transco model Although both utilities cited unique reasons for their departure their move to the Alliance RTO does support a clear preference for the transco model of transmission management over the ISO model ComEd contends that since the completion of its merger with PECO Energyforming the new comp any Exelonit has a significant amount of transmission assets in the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland PJM region and the Alliance RTO offers a better fit for the combined PECO Unicom transmission assets Specifically ComEd argued that the bulk of its customers and suppliers are in the eastern half of the United States where the Alliance RTO is more prominent The Midwest ISO on the other hand has established its presence to the north and west of ComEds service territory From a legal standpoint ComEd claim s that it can break its ties with the Midwest ISO because under a charter agreement it is allowed to depart since its transmission facilities change d ownership through the merger Thinking it might be able to avoid litigation ComEd has promised to meet any financial obligations to the Midwest ISO before it officially departs for the Alliance RTO Illinois Power one of the original nine participants in the Midwest ISO dating back to January was the first utility to make its exit from the Midwest ISO Illinois Power like ComEd claimed that its acquisition by Dynegy constituted a change in ownership freeing itself from the ISO agreement and that a move to the Alliance RTO would be more appropriate However as Ive inferred I believe both utilities have made their attempt ed moves because of a desire to operate under a forprofit transco model The impetus for both of their departures probably had less to do with their respective mergers and more to do with the fact that previous talks to form a transco operating separately under the Midwest ISO fizzled last summer Perhaps concluding that the ISO model would be restrictive Illinoi s Power has stated that its reasons for the changeinheart came about becaus e of greater flexibility and cost savings that would be realized by being a member of the Alliance RTO These benefits would originate from the RTOs experience in deregulated markets many members of the Alliance RTO operate in deregulated states as opposed to the members of the Midwest ISO The Alliance RTO also eliminates pancaked rates and provides price certainty through its postage stamp rate for transactions providing power outside of or through the Alliance and its license plate rate for all transacti ons that deliver power within the Alliance Although ComEd and Illinois Power have announced their departures its important to note that the Midwest ISO is not going to let them leave witho ut a fight Realizing that losing the transmission assets of both utilities severely diminishes the bulk of its organization the Midwest ISO has submitted a motion with FERC to block the utilities exit ComEd for instance contributes about percent of the load that was originally scheduled to flow through the Midwest ISO Thus the Midwest ISO is arguing that creating a broad RTO based on widely dispersed transmission assets is in the best interest of all of its members In addition the Midwest ISO contends that allowing utilities to easily switch from one RTO to another would compromise reliability across interconnected transmission grids Ironically the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power along with the FERC investigation of the case comes at a time when the Midwest ISO appeared to be growing Just last month Kansas Citybased UtiliCorp and Fergus Falls Minnbased Otter Tail Power Co announced that they were joining the Midwest ISO The addition of UtiliCorp was a major coup for the Midwest ISO as the energy company owns about miles of electric transmission lines Wisconsin Public Service Resources and American Transmission recentl y joined as transmissionowning members and Calpine Corp joined as a nontransmission member In addition the Midwest ISO just announced that it is assuming management responsibility for the operating functions of the MidAmerican Interconnected Network MAIN which provides electricity to about milli on people within key Midwest states overseen by the Midwest ISO The partnersh ip of the two organizations should help to facilitate a smooth transition for the Midwest ISO to become operational on its target date next December In any event it is clear that the SP downgrading of the Midwest ISO is a direct reaction to the likely departure of ComEd and Illinois Power something that FERC may not be able to prevent Specifically SP is acknowledging that the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power will result in a material loss of some load subject to the Midwest ISO cost adder What this means is that the Midwest ISOs debt repayment obligations are based on a cost adder that is applied to certain transmission loads The cost adder is capped at centsMWh during the transition period from the start of operations fourth quarter until the fourthquarter of As noted ComEd contributes about percent of the load that is scheduled to flow through the Midwest ISO If ComEd and Illinois Power actually do leave the Midwest ISO this could result in a higher cost adder being placed on remaining members While the Midwest ISOs costs are fully recoverable under its tariff with remaining members raising its cost adder could have a negative impact on the lowcost economic incentives that the Midwest ISO has used to attract new members Moreover the future prospects for the Midwest ISO remain questionable If ComEd and Illinois Power are allowed to leave it could spark a mass exodus of other members which obviously would shrink the organization and cast in doubt its status among other RTOs Moving forward during this period of upheaval the central challenge for the Midwest ISO is to identif y the benefits of joining its notforprofit model when so many utilities clearly prefer the forprofit transco model DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you

more about SCIENTECHs Mergers Acquisitions and Convergence in the US Electric Industry InfoGrid at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM announced yesterday that it intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka Kansas based Western Resources WR in a taxfree stockforstock transaction The deal will require that WR separate its nonutility assets from its regulated utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders ANALYSIS In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry strategic combinations are becoming more commonplace This announcement took me by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of merger WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp United by attempting to acquire KCPL in At the time WR share price was above In WR share price soared to record highs of more than WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed They sold their interest in ADT for a million profit This profit masked a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the time was cutting WR rates by million reducing earnings by cents per share WR who obviously had a strategic focus on security used the profits from the ADT sale to purchase percent of Protection One one of the fastest growing companies in the monitored security business Protection One hit some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result their stock tumbled WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be favorable to them As a result some moved their money out of WR and by WR share price had tumbled to to In January of this year KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off the merger WR immediately split itself into two organizations regulated utility operations and nonregulated business with the intent of finding a buyer for the regulated utility operations WR claimed in June of this year that companies were being courted including international companies for the utility operations assets of Kansas Power Light KPL and Kansas Gas and Electric KGE Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me But it does fit SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba CEO of PNM just weeks ago and asked if the development of alliances mergers and acquisitions were a part of the positive approach to PNMs strategy Jeff answered Very definitely Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business and that can bring a sustainable competitive advantage are essential for us in this industry The criticality of market channels cant be overemphasized Once you have a good market channel that doesnt mean that everything you put through that market channel you have to do yourself or you have to own You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances There are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves something that is core to your business So both alliances and acquisitions will be a part of PNMs future Just weeks later PNM is buying WR Utilizing my rear view mirror now I see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM They both operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix including nuclear They both have multicommodity in electric and gas They both have wholesale operations PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part to a strong wholesale operation PNM net earnings for the nine months ended Sept totaled million or per share diluted on total operating revenues of billion compared to earnings of million or per share in the first three quarters of PNM has adopted a niche strategy in the wholesale power market by developing tailored wholesale power products for its customers While some of the megatraders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard commodity PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according to the needs of the buyer PNM has found success in this niche segment of a large wholesale market The merger deal is expected to take between and months to complete PNM will inherit approximately billion in debt making the total value of the deal worth billion Fitch has placed its securities ratings of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving Fitch plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact of the merger Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist between Wichita and Topeka This may result in a rate case It should also be noted that Wichita Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover municipalize the electric system from Western Resources within its city limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka Wichita has about power customers roughly a fourth of all the customers served by Western Resources They represent more than million of KGEs million in revenues PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has demonstrated its ability to do so PNM has decreased its debttocapital ratio from percent to less than percent in the last seven years The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque NM and the chairman president and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba Search SCIENTECHs PowerHitter archive to read about our

Company TNPC NYSE NPW which bills itself as the first national residential and small business energy provider announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy Inc to provide windgenerated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area Under the terms of the agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of ANALYSIS This is an interesting development especially considering that TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from PECO Energy This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain On the other hand it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company founded earlier this year by Enron along with partners AOL and IBM As you may recall just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply competitive default service for approximately of PECOs residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement arguing that the PECOTNPC agreement is not in the public interest and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question Thus it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services Up to this point TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers such as the approximately natural gas and electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group The acquisition of the customers in PECOs territory was a major coup for TNPC which is still in startup mode Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy Community Energy the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatthours allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power Interestingly the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about MW of green power to aggregated state agencies This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio Thus while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPCs original business plan the company appears to be moving in this direction at least in states where it is strategic to do so However this announcement comes on the heels of TNPCs announcement of its thirdquarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price TNPCs revenues for Q were million derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states Pennsylvania and New Jersey Gross profit was million or percent of revenues Yet the loss on earnings before income tax EBIT was million The net loss for the quarter was million or per basic share TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history Therefore the company contends that its yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance The companys goal for Q is to achieve revenues of approximately to million with an estimated yearend customer count of Eugene Lockhart TNPCs CEO said he was pleased with the Q performance Lockhart contends that TNPC achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives and referenced the fact that the company is still building its systems and architecture so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets In addition TNPC has raised approximately million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation However despite its positive outlook after TNPC made its earnings announcement its shares took a nosedive perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy providers ability to meet its objectives The shares closed last Friday at which is a dramatic drop from the average price of before the Q earnings announcement TNPC issued its IPO on Oct at a price of per share which at the time seemed quite high for a startup energy company with a limited track record A day after its opening the stock closed at per share The stock was received so favorably for two reasons in my estimation First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners among others put up about million in startup capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner of TNPC with percent control Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over customers Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock and the company is at a crossroads In order to keep its momentum on track TNPC needs to do two things First it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states Second as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors Consequently it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven Regarding the customer base expansion Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target Just last week the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state Yet its clear that TNPC is still finetuning its marketing approach In Ohio it is offering customers competitive energy prices flexible payment and pricing choices and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive but there is no mention in TNPCs application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio Moreover several questions remain Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC Will TNPC demonstrate revenues of million in Q And where will the companys next acquisition of customers take place All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC Miss last week Catch up on

article Bright Lights A Conversation With Kevin Jordan President of Excel Energy Technologies Ltd at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml SCIENTECH IssueAlert November SmartEnergy Rounds Up million in Financing Is an IPO in the Works By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities venture capital and global banks SmartEnergy a privately held Internetbased energy service provider active in New York plans to use the funding as working capital to rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment schedule ANALYSIS You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago IssueAlert Oct when I drew attention to the fact that the online startup was taking customers away from ConEdison In existence only since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers Under a promotion currently under way in New York SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to percent on energy through the winter months for naturalgas customers in the boroughs of New York City and Westchester County Capitalizing on ongoing threats about low supplies of oil and natural gas SmartEnergy is using the socalled energy crisis to lure customers away from the traditional utility by locking in current naturalgas rates over the course of the next months under its Smart Fixed Rate plan As a policy SmartEnergy hedges the products that its sell to customers so that neither the company nor its customers is exposed to energy market price risks In addition SmartEnergy has offered United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement to secure customers As I discussed last month an advantage that online energy providers such as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers In addition operating online allows SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets Up until now SmartEnergys marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York state However the company claims that it will be serving six states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the end of this year SmartEnergy expects to be serving all deregulated states by the end of and the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support this anticipated growth Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns as the energy industry continues to become deregulated Investors that are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy WPS Resources Corporation Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors In addition there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round including Dexia Ventures the private equity arm of Dexia Bank a USD billion asset bank based in Belgium KBC Bank and venture capitalist groups Trust Capital Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures The inclusion of both American and European investors is important Coupled with SmartEnergys intention to operate in all US states that are deregulating the fact that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic The fact that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform of worldwide service In fact Alliant Energy identified the strong growth of the Internet and technology in the energy segment as a key reason why it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy In fact the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison Wisbased Alliant has been in existence for several months The utilitys nonregulated subsidiary Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy to expand a decidedly efocused business The partnership with SmartEnergy represents Alliants new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies offering stateoftheart technology and new products and services for customers In fact Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as the energy company of today and tomorrow and believes that it has a platform that can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world Of course my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy It would certainly be an obvious move for the private company to head in this direction especially now as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street Ive written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like Evergreen Solar Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid IPOs as a result of in my opinion their business models in new technologies and or alternative fuels There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years With few exceptions energy companies exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several months have performed comparatively well As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid startup companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer service again resulting from its online presence Customer interaction can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet enabling account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at any time The downside of course is customer reluctance to sign up with a startup company that they may not know In addition SmartEnergy faces tough competition from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in deregulated markets including Utilitycom and Essentialcom None of these companies has yet gone public and are instead focusing on building critical mass and establishing their brand identities Yet of the three SmartEnergy may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion and could be on the fast track to an IPO in the near term SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts and consultants will get results Learn more about our

most popular competitive tools including the Mergers and Acquisitions Telecommunications and ECommerce InfoGrids at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to be built according to a new report from Financial Times Energy The additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through but also includes Finland France Germany Sweden and the United Kingdom At the same time concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being exacerbated by Germanys plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power ANALYSIS If FT Energys projections for necessary generation additions in Europe are accurate I think there are some real challenges that the Continent will face in reaching this goal First off for perspective lets be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming Europe will need by The figure of MW is roughly equivalent to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system in Texas When we consider also that the United States consumes about double the amount of power that Europe consumes the projection that Europe will need an additional MW of new generating capacity is a staggering proposition Granted like other developed areas of the world Europes energy consumption has grown over the last two years According to data included in its report FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from terrawatthours TWh in to TWh in an increase of about percent per year While this may seem like a minimal increase it is important to note that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average For instance estimated new capacity additions through are mainly concentrated in Spain France Germany and Sweden The growth in demand coupled with market liberalization has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction or purchase of generation assets Although reportedly percent of the electricity market across Europe has been liberalized to date the Continent remains rather disjointed as it is composed of national markets that are all approaching privatization at different speeds The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their privatization movements in the early s Spain required its stateowned utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February a process that will continue through Germany decided to open percent of its market all at once in April And France resisted efforts to privatize and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European Union Consequently although Europe may in fact need the MW of new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected the type and extent to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on the energy policy of each independent nation A variety of restrictions may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount of capacity Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization and by extension its approach to generation development I cant examine the policy of each country in this forum but I think a look at Germany is warranted both because it is a major component of Europes total energy market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact the Continent as a whole Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened to competition It follows that generation coming from Germany should contribute a large percentage of the Continents future power needs However a large percentage of Germanys power has come from nuclear power but that has all changed over the last year After the Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party nuclear energy became an unacceptable energy source The German government has essentially put a moratorium on nuclear power and in fact decided to eventually shut down nuclear power plants in the country Just last month Germanys two largest power producers RWE AG and EON AG announced plans to cut output from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has developed since Germany liberalized its market The measures amount to a reduction of about percent in Germanys overall power generating capacity Moreover nuclear energy has generated over onethird of Germanys nearly billion kilowatthours of annual electricity demand and onethird of Western Europes total electricity supply As the future of nuclear power in Germany looks rather dim big questions surround what will replace nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europes energy industry Coal currently produces about percent of the power generation in Germany but as a result of the countrys attempts to lower emissions coal also appears to be on a decline Also in Germany as in the rest of Europe coalindustry subsidies will come to an end as early as making it less economical to invest in coalfired plants At the same time other countries like France are exploring cleancoal technologies but it is questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand across the Continent Generally natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will take the place of nuclear power in Europe given the seemingly abundant supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea However as demand across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases this may impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe In addition there are no effective rules across Europe for thirdparty access to private pipeline grids also putting into question the future of naturalgas supplies Also as we have seen in the United States as demand for natural gas increases so will the prices which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary power source As a result much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable energy In fact the German government wants to double renewable energy output to percent of total energy demand by using such forms as hydroelectric and wind power This seems consistent with what the rest of Europe is doing The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate percent of its electricity from renewable resources by Scandinavian countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and lowemission forms of energy with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of the Nordic regions total electricity production Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western Europe with projects in Germany Denmark and Spain ranking among the fastestgrowing in the world Again according to the US DOE wind power is projected to grow by percent per year in Western Europe This growth prospective is pretty dismal and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe Renewable energy works fine when planning overall energy needs but it rarely can be relied on to meet peak demand The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to and the sun shines when it wants to which can make peak planning based on renewable energy difficult if not impossible This being the case many critics say Europes current move toward renewable energy is completely unrealistic arguing that it would take nearly wind turbines to equal one nuclear plant In addition the growth for renewable energy is plotted over the course of ten to fifteen years FT Energy marks the year as the point at which Europe will need the additional MW of generating capacity In addition despite the fact that coalfired generation poses pollution problems it is still a comparatively lowcost form of generation This will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence of a strong worldwide commitment The US Department of Energy projects only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy through just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain a slim percent share of the total world energy consumption So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs First keep in mind that Ive focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role in Europe as a whole However the restrictions on nuclear power are not necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries For instance the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by opening a plant in Temelin The question is without Germanys contribution of nuclear power will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other power sources and other countries Although the MW goal seems very ambitious Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use of merchant plants As competition continues wholesale power buyers are demanding shorterterm contracts which in turn is supporting a growing trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent Presently only the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power but there are signs that the trend is extending to Italy Spain the Netherlands and even Germany In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear power merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europes naturalgas market Yet as we have seen in California the plant siting process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles and it is not clear if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries Plus the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily naturalgas fired which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source Moreover just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter due to our own brand of energy supply problems we are finding that the problem is not limited to our part of the world It is of course unknown if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of MW by Yet at the same time it is clear that demand on the Continent continues to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at webrciwebnsfwebDeptsIAhtml SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Corp Pursues Multiple Generation Projections Looks Outside of California for Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD PGE Corp NYSE PCG announced that it will acquire a MW wind power generating station near Palm Springs Calif to supply electricity to the Western power grid PGE subsidiary National Energy Group is purchasing the plant from Seawest Wind Power Inc a San Diegobased developer of wind energy plants PGE expects the plant to enter commercial operation in the spring of ANALYSIS This is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom for PGE Corp Just over the last two months PGE Corp also has announced several other generation projects both within California and in other strategic areas of the country National Energy Group NEGPGE Corps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New Englandis spearheading all of the new generation projects PGE Corp claims that its goal is for NEG to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by Thus the accelerate d increase of megawatts under the NEG banner certainly is working toward that goal Lets take a quick look at the other generation projects that PGE Corp has announced in addition to the Palm Springs wind power facility Just last week NEG announced a longterm tolling agreement with Southaven Power an affiliate of Cogentrix Energy Under terms of the agreement NEGs subsidiary PGE Energy Trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced at an MW naturalgas fueled combined cycle located in Mississippi just south of the Tennessee border near Memphis The deal is noteworthy because it positions NEG close to the existing TVA and Entergy electric substations that will deliver the plants electricity into the regions transmission grid This announcement followed other substantial projects in Southern Californi a and Oregon The MW Otay Mesa Generating Project located in San Diego County is in the final stages of plant siting The project represents the first new power plant built in San Diego County in almost three decades and of course will become operational during a time when low supplies in California continue to drive up prices In Oregon NEG has just submitte d an application to build a new plant in Hermiston Ore adjacent to an alreadyexisting MW plant that NEG coowns with PacifiCorp The propose d Umatilla Generating Project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine that will burn natural gas with its fuel supply transported via the NEGs Pacific Northwest naturalgas pipeline The growth of NEG is a real success for PGE Corp at a time when its regulated subsidiary is struggling PGE Company the utility that provides natural gas and electric service to approximately million people in Northern and Central California has accumulated about billion in debt PGE Co buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal e market but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the company has little control over the rates it can charge customers Thus over the course of last summer PGE Co was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour PGE remains embroiled in negotiations with the CPUC over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt While the regulated PGE Co could find itself wallowing in the red dependi ng on regulatory rulings NEG has soared In the Q of PGE Corp report ed second quarter earnings from operations of per share on a diluted basis or million which represented a percent over diluted earning s from operations in the same quarter in Much of this success can be attributed to NEG which reported Q earnings of million which reflect ed a percent profit increase from the previous years quarter The winning streak continued into Q in which PGE Corp reported diluted earnings from operations at per share or million and revenues of billion compared with third quarter revenues of billion This constituted a percent increase in profit for the parent company Again NEG performed very well NEG contributions rose with diluted earnings from operations of per share or million on revenues of billi on Clearly PGE Corp has benefited greatly from NEGs ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside of the regulated California market Thus it is no wonder that although PGE Corp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated In addition the plant siting process in California historically has been quite restrictive and lengthy which also may explain why PGE Corp has chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state The siting process in California shows signs of becoming more facile In fact just yesterday the California Energy Commission adopted emergency regulations to implement the states new sixmonth power plant licensing process The new regulations allow for environmentally advanced power plantssuch as PGEs wind power plant in Palm Springsto be licensed and come online more quickly in California Currently PGE Corp has ownership and arrangement interests in more than plants the bulk of which are managed by NEG The companys generation portfolio currently consists of MW and more than MW in new power plant development and construction is in production As PGE Corp continues to expand its generation base it probably realizes that current industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least MW in order to be a formidable player By comparison a company like AEP clearly one the top generation companies in the industryhas a worldwide generat ing capacity of MW As NEG is PGEs primary growth vehicle at the prese nt time I think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced by this subsidiary Some questions remain Will PGE Corp split its unregulated and regulated operations into two standalone companies as other utilities such as AEP and Reliant have recently announced I checked with my sources at PGE Corp and the official company position is that there are no plans to restructure in this way at this time However PGE Corp does acknowledge the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for its regulated companys debt while showing a percent profit increase from its unregulated business Also what are the prospects for PGE Corps hydroelectric system Accordi ng to prior agreements PGE Corp was supposed to sell its MW hydroelectric system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in Septem ber However just last August PGE Corp petitioned the CPUC to halt this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold from the regulated PGE Co to an asofyetunformed unregulated subsidiary for billion PGE Corps motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou s the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale of hydropower at market prices In addition according to a Sept report from Dow Jones Newswires assuming a book value of about million for the hydroelectric system PGE Corp could take the remaining billion to pay off the transition debts incurred by PGE Co The CPUC and PGE Corp continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system and whether or not PGE Corp should be allowed to sell the assets to an unregulated company While this debate rages on NEG is free to continue along its aggressive growth mode DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Duke Williams to Buy Gulfstream from Coastal Corporation By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly purchase The Coastal Corporations percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project The purchase expected to be finalized by the end of this year is subject to federal regulatory approvals and conditione d upon completion of the Coastal El Paso Energy Corporation merger Financi al terms of the purchase were not disclosed ANALYSIS The Gulfstream project is a proposed mile steel pipeline designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida The project has been sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp a billion Houstonbased energy holding company with operations in naturalgas production distribut ion and marketing Coastal Corp is presently waiting for FERCs approval to build and operate the system However due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Corps pending merger with El Paso Energy Corp Coastal Corp was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project As a result Duke Energy and Williams have found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida market Until the merger is complete Coastal Corp will continue to develo p and market Gulfstream According to Coastal the billion Gulfstream project has already achie ved two important milestones in its FERC approval process preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues and a favorable draft environmental impact statement The company anticipates that the project will receive full FERC approval in the first quarter and that Gulfstream will become fully operational in June Approximately miles of the route which originates in Mobile Ala crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters Gulfstream offers billion cubic feet of naturalgas capacity per day and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and powergeneration facilities that plan on using highefficiency natural gas turbines Already the project has precedent agreements with large Flori da utilities and power generation facilities Upon completion of the purchase Duke and Williams will proceed with the jointly managed operation and development of the Gulfstream project Its not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be interested in making the acquisition The two companies which have historically had a collaborative relationship already own significant amounts of interstate naturalgas pipeline capacity Between its two subsidiaries involved in naturalgas productionDuke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission Duke Energy owns and operates about miles of pipeline and intersta te miles of capacity Williams five interstate natural gas pipelines reported ly deliver about percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States The companys vast mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada serving more than million residential commercial and industrial natural gas users In fact the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida a mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstrea m project will follow Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer project now that they are acquiring the Gulfstream project The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Florida The CEO of Williams gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market would support only one new pipeline coming into the state By joining together Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the highgrowth state as it eventually becomes competitive First among the priorities for the project is to ensur e adequate pipeline capacity by June and meeting the projected MW electric generation growth that is expected by Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project accelerates its own entry into Florida In fact Richard Priory Dukes CEO conceded at a conference last September that much of Dukes future success will result from its naturalgas operations Specifically Duke has been focused on merchant plant and naturalgas pipeline construction for some time As of this summer Duke was rated third in announced merchan t plants behind Calpine and Panda and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants and acquiring naturalgas pipelines Thus the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make And the strategy is resulting in some significant payoffs for the company Dukes thirdquarter earnings rose percent Duke attributed the higher results to the continued expansion of its unregulated energy businesses specifically naturalgas gathering and foreign energy sales Dukes shares which had been trading at week peaks are currently trading at as of the opening of the market on Nov Current market conditions certainly validate Dukes growth in this direction For starters current data indicate that natural gas is the fuel of choice for approximately percent of all new electric generation that is being built Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from trillion to trill ion cubic feet per year by In addition coal and nuclear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades at a time when naturalgas prices were comparatively low All of these factors have created a strong market for naturalgas generation despite the fact that data from the Department of Energy suggests a shortage of natural gas and heating oil for this winter Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market so this purchase could facilitate easier expansion in the state About a year ago the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach However the states three IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court arguing that merch ant plants were not allowed under state law The Florida Supreme Court overturn ed the decision of the state PSC blocking Dukes entry into the state Consequently Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another way to get into the Florida market and one that is potentially more profitable Florida has not yet passed restructuring legislation and it is unclear when the state will become competitive Bills have been introduced into the state legislature but thorny issues such as stranded cost recovery and unbundling charges have caused the bills to be removed Presently Governor Jeb Bush has created a member commission to develop an energy plan for the state The commission must submit a report to the governor and the legislature by December Among the issues that must be addressed are power reliability energy supply and delivery and the fiscal impacts of deregulation However it is clear from the commissions deadlin e that competition will not take effect in Florida during Yet looking forward if the California experience is any indication the naturalgas shortage should work to Dukes advantage As wholesale prices skyrocketed this summer Duke and other generators were in a prime position to reap large gains Duke is still following this tactic on the West Coast California regulators just gave approval to the construction of a proposed MW unit in Monterey County which again is naturalgas fired combine d cycle unit If California history repeats itself in Florida Duke and Willi ams will be the coowners of the only new gas pipeline coming into the state at a time when naturalgas supplies remain quite low DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy NYSE DYN and NRG Energy NYSE NRG announced a major expansion of their coowned generation portfolio in the West through asset purchase agreements to acquire MW of power generation facilities from Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The facilities include the MW gasfired Clark Generating Station and MW of the MW coalfired Reid Gardner Generating Station The facilities are currently owned by Sierra Pacific Resources subsidiary Nevada Power Company and serve the growing Las Vegas market ANALYSIS This million purchase has resulted from regulatory mandates surrounding the Sierra PacificNevada Power merger which was completed in July Sierra Pacific is undergoing the sale and transfer of all of its remaining gas oil and naturalgas fired Nevada generating assets which it intends to complete in The Reid Gardner and Clark Stations are among the seven asset bundles that were included in an auction by Sierra Pacific earlier this year Located in southeastern Las Vegas the Clark Generating Station consists of gas and oilfired generating units which as noted total MW The oldes t unit at the Clark Generating Station became operational in the newest in Specific information about which units at the Clark Generating Station are included in this purchase was not available The Reid Gardner Generating Station consists of four baseload coalfired units and is locate d miles northeast of Las Vegas According to recent data from the Energy Information Administration the California Department of Water Resources owns about percent of the Reid Gardner Plant It is not clear what impac t the Dynegy NRG purchase will have on this organizations ownership in the plant The purchase of the Sierra Pacific assets is subject to approval from the Federal Trade Commission FERC and the Nevada Public Utilities Commission and is expected to close during the second quarter of Additional conditions of the deal include a power purchase agreement for Nevada Power to buy energy and ancillary services from Dynegy and NRG at a stable price until March On their own both companies are leaders in independent power production and energy supply Yet this acquisition is the latest in a string of collaborative efforts between Dynegy and NRG Together the companies have been actively acquiring power plants in Illinois and the West Coast along with purchases that they have made independently In fact this purchase of assets from Sierra Pacific marks the sixth asset alliance between Dynegy and NRG Together the two companies jointly own MW of power generation facilities in California and MW in Illinois In most of the partnerships and in the case of this latest purchase from Sierra Pacific Dynegy markets the energy produced at the plants and oversees fuel management services while NRG manages the operational side Last July Dynegy and NRG entered into a similar agreement to expand the Rocky Road Power Plant a natural gasfired simple cycle peaking facility in East Dundee Illinois The move into Illinois was an important strategy for both companies Of course Dynegy completed its merger with Illinova last summer creating a billion company that is wellpositioned to compete in electric generation wholesale and retail marketing and gas and electric power trading At the time the CEO of NRG Energy made it clear that the Rocky Road plant expansion was part of the two companies strategy in becoming a large contributor to the Chicagoarea energy market Dynegy in fact intends to continue acquiring and expanding generation facilities in Illinois so that it can compete with Exelon Corp Moreover both companies are positioning themselves to be leaders in generation capacity and power supply and the purchase of the MW from Sierra Pacific factors in to both of their strategies Not only does the acquisiti on help to expand both companies asset base but it also diversifies their power supply offerings For instance NRG claims that the assets complement its current gasfired peaking and intermediate California assets providing the benefits of fuel and dispatch level diversification NRG aims to build a top three position in its primary markets The acquisition of assets from Sierra Pacific puts NRG into a prime position in the fastgrowing Nevada and Western markets by adding a strong component of baseload generat ion to its portfolio In fact this is the second acquisition that NRG has made from Sierra Pacif ic Just last month NRG announced its intent to purchase a percent interest in the Valmy Power Station which Sierra Pacific is selling also as a resul t of regulatory mandates The Valmy Power Station which is primarily coalfired produces electricity in the northern Nevada and surrounding markets In this million deal NRG acted as an independent buyer Dynegy has long claimed that it wants to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five year by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others In order to reach this goal I had projected last summer that Dynegy might be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale considering the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies The compan y has now taken a different path to achieve essentially the same result The addition of Sierra Pacifics facilities combined with other assets that the company has acquired or developed this year increases Dynegys generating capacity by more than gross megawatts Dynegy contends that this figure is comparable to many industry mergers without the regulat ed transmission and distribution businesses Dynegy also believes the acquisit ion will support a raise in its earnings forecast for from to per share Dynegys goals are pretty ambitious However the company has been increasi ng earnings over the last year so the per share target may be attainabl e For Q Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the compan ys consolidated net income There is little doubt that Dynegy and NRG considering that they own MW of power in the state benefited from the short supplies in California this summer whichalong with other factorsdr ove up the cost for power in the state Another interesting element to this announcement is the fact that similar strategic acquisitions are being made possible by mandated divestiture that other companies have faced due to merger activity Just yesterday I wrote about Duke and Williams embarking on a joint venture to purchase the Gulfstream pipeline project from Coastal Corp This sale was made possi ble because Coastal is being forced to divest the pipeline as a result of its merger with El Paso Energy As the old adage goes one companys loss is another companys gain which could be viewed as one of the drawbacks of MA activity Another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing between companies The Duke Williams and Dynegy NRG projects are both examples of companies that have collaborated on development and acquisition ventures to support both their joint and individual strategies As the energy industry becomes more competitive likeminded companies may find that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by for example Southern Company DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Read SCIENTECHs free SourceBook Weekly article AES SourceBooks

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Endesa NYSE ELE Spains largest power utility has signed an agreement with Charbonnages de France CDF to acquire a percent interest in the French electricity generator Societe Nationale dElectricite et de Thermiqu e SNET The transaction has been authorized by the French Government The agreement includes Endesas right to increase its interest in SNET in the medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies and allow Endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in France and Europe ANALYSIS The approval for Endesa to acquire percent interest in SNET cements the companys move into France which is a major component in the aggressive expansion efforts Endesa has been implementing this year SNET while a comparatively small company by American standards is still the second largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity and third largest in terms of electricity generation SNET owns five coal plants totaling megawatts which generate about GWh annually This is a very low output and in fact SNET accounts for only percent of the market share in France However given the fact that Frances larges t energy company EDF still has a hold on about percent of the market in the country any acquisition of the nextlargest company is a major coup The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the companys experience in coalbased electricitywhich still is the po wer source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent and its progressiveness in terms of technology Presently SNET sells the bulk of its electricity output to EDF under a longterm contract between the two companies The rest of its generation is sold to eligible customers In addition to its current assets SNET is also planning a new MW gasfired station in eastern France and is the front runner to build a new cleancoal plant in the heavily industriali zed Rhone Valley Thus as France slowly opens its market to competition SNET could emerge as one of the major providers Endesa was able to beat out other bidders for SNET including Frances Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and Germanys RWE due to the positive valuation of Endesas industrial and commercial projects and the economic value of its offer Endesa already entered the French market last month with a threeyear exclusive agreement to serve the energy needs of SEB a small appliance company The companys move outside of Spain resulted from several factors First the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of its largest electric companies essentially landlocking the domestic growt h of companies like Endesa and forcing them to look outward for growth opportunities In addition growth in countries like France and Germany is probably appeal ing to Endesa because their central location offers additional expansion opportunities into Italy and Eastern Europe Just within the last year privatization has come to the major European countrieseither all at once as in the case of Germany or in forced increments as occurred in France There has been little question that Endesa would like to develop generation interests across the Continent and has taken advantage of competitive opportunities as they have emerged In fact Endesa disclosed that it plans to become a leading European power player through the swap of assets with other electricity customers and through acquisitions Rumor has it that Endesa is also lookin g to acquire the generation assets of EnelItalys stateowned power and the biggest European rival to EDF However as Endesa expands abroad it continues to face significant problems in Spain due mostly to its proposed merger with the second largest electricity provider in the country Iberdrola Just last month Endesa announced that it had entered into a friendly merger with Iberdrola Together the two companies will gain a hold over percent of Spains power market with a combined market capitalization of the equivalent to billion Reported ly the merger will create the worlds thirdbiggest electricity company after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron However Spanish oil company Repsol which lost out on the bid for Iberdrola to Endesa continues to contemplate renew ing a hostile takeover of the company Repsol claims that it in fact offered more euros per share than what Endesa has promised to pay for Iberdrola in their billion merger but that Iberdrola did not even consider the bid Both Endesa and Repsol are partially owned by the Spanish government only percent of Endesa is publicly traded so presently negotiations are being held to see if a compromise can be reached Reportedly the merge r between Endesa and Iberdrola can occur only if some of the companies belong ing to the merged company are sold as per the Spanish antimonopoly legislation Ironically this could benefit Repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization across the Continent In fact France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the European Union While other European countries have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although Endesa is certainly pushing through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country A report from the Parisbased International Energy Agency issued just last week contends that Frances power liberalization law restricts power trading and allows EDF to keep its market advantages However even though Endesa may face expansion limitations in France it is important to remember how large the company is in its home country Endesa produces about half of Spains electricity MW relying mainly on nuclear and coalfired plants Looking to diversify Endesa also owns interests in gas water and telecommunications companies It is the largest shareholder in Auna a jointly owned company with partners Telecom Italia and Unin Fenosa that controls Retevisin Spains secondlargest phone company behind Telefnica In addition Endesa is also investing heavily in energy firms in Latin America Thus although France is very important for Endesas European expansion efforts the company is still a contender in other key markets DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a sponsorship of IssueAlert by contacting Nancy Spring at or Advertising opportunities are also available on our website DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Co Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Last Wednesday PGE Co proposed a fiveyear rate stabilization plan that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than billio n in power costs incurred last summer Under PGEs plan submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC for approval average residential bills of would increase to about a month as of Jan This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes after an existing rate freeze ends by However a portion of the incre ase also would go to paying down the billion in unforeseen charges that PGE insists are not the utilitys responsibility ANALYSIS Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this past summer focused on San Diego Gas Electric SDGE the legacy of the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PGE and Southern California Edison SCE as both utilities have yet to fully enter competitive markets within the state This latest proposal from PGE is an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently carries Lets first understand how PGE found itself in the red since this is critical to the utilitys argument that customers should be responsible for the debt Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in its service territory PGE must its power on the wholesale market In addition under Californias restructuring mandates PGE had to buy its power out of the Power Exchange PX rather than establishing bilateral contracts with suppliers The combination of low supply and high demand drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer which PGE faced as a buyer Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect PGE has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers Although reports vary on average PGE has been paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market when by law it is only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour As a result of these factors PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting relief from its debt and also its argument thatsince it was obligated to buy the power for customers in the first placeits customers should ultimately carry the burden for the high costs PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off Consequently PGE has been lobbying to the CPUC for several months for various options that would all result in PGE custom ers picking up the billion tab The utility first proposed to retroactivel y bill customers for the debt This latest proposal changes the course a bit to provide for a rate increase but the end result would essentially be the same Under the proposal PGEs rate freeze would end Jan and resident ial and small business customers would begin paying cents per kilowatt hour for five years compared with the current wholesale costs of cents per kilowatt hour generation costs Without such a rate stabilizati on plan in place PGE warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more than after the rate freeze is lifted The utility also contends that the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summers high prices amounts to less than percent of the total monthly increases To reduce the impact on lowincome customers the utility plans to increase their discount to percent from the percent they currently receive PGE said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates proved not to be high enough to cover costs If the deficit of uncollected costs grew by billion for example then rates at the start of would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around percent to cents Skepticsincluding some within the CPUCsay PGE is simply looking to protect its own interests Carl Wood a CPUC commissioner referred to PGEs propo sal as volume two of their bailout request and noted that the request results in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the utilitys debt The consumer group TURN contends that PGE and not custome rs is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred The group also argues that although PGE has cast its proposal under a guise of customer protection the proposal only really serves to assure PGE of full recovery of its debt In addition TURN noted that PGE submitted its proposal to the CPUC on the day before Thanksgiving conceivably to downplay media attention and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC PGE remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal PGE believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers for debt it believes it accrued on its customers behalf PGEs proposal comes at a time when the utilitys reputation has taken a beating A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that the CPUC received more than complaints about PGE from to According to the report PGE received more than three times as many complaints per customer as SDGE during the past three years which is quite significa nt considering that SDGE customers were exposed to bills that increased by two and three times their normal amounts last summer The comparison betwee n PGE and SDGE was made because they are the only major private utilities in the state to offer both electric and gas service PGE also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide From to PGE complaints represented percent of the total filed with the CPUC even though it only has percent of gas customers and percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the state Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PGE concerned billing problems In its own defense PGE claims that it faces a unique set of weatherrelated conditions that make the service it provide s to customers more fraught with problems which consequently results in more complaints It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PGEs request but prior comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility s proposal will be rejected This casts a dark shadow over the future of PGE as without being able to bill customers for its debt it is uncertain how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent Ironically unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PGE Corp continue to perform well and show profits Yet the huge debt of PGE Co may become an overwhelming anchor around the parent companys neck in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help

Duke Energy Offers FixedPriced Electricity Package for SDGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Duke Energy through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE M W electricity load The offer would establish a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for wholesale power supply for the next five years based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENA s proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in commen ts submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electric ity market ANALYSIS As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere SDGE customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity last summer and into this fall which resulted primarily from an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California In addition other contributory factors have included the states economic growth lack of new power plants over the last decade unstable existing generation and the uncertainty of import prospects As SDGEs rate freeze had been lifted last spring customers of the utilit y were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded cents per kilowatthour compared to the cent per kilowatt hour maximum they had become accustomed to under the rate freeze The problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices However SDGE customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for Californias other two IOUs SCE and PGE DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power for the totality of SDGEs MW electricity load In return DENAs proposed fixed rate of cents per kilowatt hour plus annual percent increases presumably will be much lower than the cost SDGE customers will continue to face without such a contract DENAs proposal has been made possible as a result of FERCs proposed order that was issued last month outlining a major overhaul of Californias energy market Since competition began in the state in the spring of the three California IOUs were required to buy their power from the states Power Exchange FERCs order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a very lucrative contract while at the same time attempting to protect SDGE customers from exorbitant electricity prices So what is SDGEs response to DENAs proposal I spoke with Doug Kline spokesperson for the utility yesterday afternoon Kline pointed out that first of all SDGE has not yet received any offer from DENA and that all weve seen thus far is a press release Kline suggested that it was a public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal to FERC and that ultimately SDGE would be the one to accept DENAs offer In order to speak in detail on DENAs proposal Kline said he would need to see an actual contract which has yet to materialize Kline did disclose that locking up longterm contracts for SDGE customers based on todays high prices would have to be seriously questioned by the utility especial ly considering that new generation will be coming online in California over the next few years Beyond that SDGE is fielding other offers from energy suppliers and in fact has established longterm contracts with other providers which remain unidentified for percent of the power it buys on the wholesale market Back in September the CPUC granted approval for SDGE as well as SCE and PGE to purchase percent of its power in forward markets with the other percent still coming from the PX For SDGE this amounts to MW of its total electricity load Kline said that SDGE would need to compare DENAs offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDGE customers At the same time Sempra EnergySDGEs parent companyhas made its o wn proposal to FERC urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDGE customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates based on generators actual fees Under FERCs proposed order the commission suggested a soft rate cap of MWh Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generator setting a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to as it says fix the crisis in California In fact back in August DENA offered California Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver MW of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie s and provide all three IOUs with fiveyear fixedpriced supply contracts Although Gov Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three IOUs SCE and PGE proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts with DENA Both deals were sealed within the last month although the speci fic prices of the contracts are proprietary DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state Just two weeks ago the company broke ground on a million modernization of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County The modernization effor t is projected to add MW of new capacity to sites current MW and create the states largest power plant DENA claims that when complete d the MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale electricity to serve approximately million households In addition DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to modernize and expand two other power plants in California Morro Bay and South Bay power plants DENAs motivations are pretty understandable The company may espouse good intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but realistically energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state I started to notice the trend last month as Q earnings were reported Virtua lly every company that is active in Californias wholesale market reported a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatili ty DENA was no exception As a whole Duke Energy reported record Q earnings of per share a percent increase over earnings per share of for Q The companys North American Wholesale Energycomprised of DENA and Duke Energy Merchantsposted sharply higher gains with EBIT of million a percent increase over Q According to Duke Energy s report DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power plants and from natural gas and power trading activities DENA remains on schedule to deliver approximately megawatts of new merchant generation nationally in time for summer Moreover it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENAs offer truly benefit s SDGE and its customers The proposal certainly benefits DENA however especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current high prices and includes annual increases Securing SDGE customers under these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market but how it stacks up against SDGEs other unnamed offers remains to be seen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Peace Software a global provider of leading ebusiness solutions for retai l energy companies announced that MidAmerican Energy Company a supplier of energy in the Midwests deregulating market has selected Peaces Energy software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets Peace Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels services and locations on a single statement said Todd Raba vice preside nt of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy ANALYSIS This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies On the national or international stage Des Moines Iowabased MidAmerican may not be considered a major player Yet within the Midwest it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence The company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than MW of diversified power generation facilities around the world providing both regulated and unregulated electric and naturalgas services to more than million customers in six states and the United Kingdom through its Northern Electr ic Gas subsidiary In August MidAmerican made its move into Ohio the fourth largest US market in terms of customers behind California Texas and Florida indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive Midwest market Just last Monday MidAmerican became the first energy compa ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier CRES in the Cincinnati Gas Electric Co territory in southwest Ohio An essential element to the utilitys growth is a comprehensive billing software system which is where the value of Peace Software comes in According to MidAmerican it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Also important to MidAmerican as it enters different states is the elimination of several automated and manual processes required by our current system This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software In this particular case Peaces Energy software will provide to MidAmerica n customers several selfserve features including customer enrollment summa ry billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in a onestopshop tool Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra cts prior to this one with MidAmerican including Enron BC Gas Dominion Retai l Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services The company is based in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utilities I spoke with Brian Peace CEO of Peace Software last June and he gave an overview of how the Energy System functions First the Energy System is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another Since its start in Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multipleproduct architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water gas and electricity into one product suite Currently the system handles not only those three commodities but also can consolidate billing information relat ed to telecommunications home security home mortgaging and other valueadded commodities and services The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing At the time of our discussion Peace said ESPs can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore Theyve got to be able to buy it at the right price combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers This is the path to being competiti ve and profitable Over the last decade Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand market and began selling its technology in the United States in That same year the company secured a contract with Enron which at the time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California retail market Of course Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin g efforts in California but still uses the Peace Energy software as it continues to penetrate other markets Peace Softwares alliance with InSITEa New Yorkbased application service providerhas led to providing the softwar e for the billing needs of Exelon Brian Peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers Of course although Peace Softwares contract with MidAmerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market the billing software business presents stiff competition Perhaps the two greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy SCT offers the SCT Banner product which was originally created to bill multiple commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well ENLOGIX uses the SCT Banner system to support multiservices across its client base including gas financing ancillary products electricity water and solid waste Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and Australia Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets Peace has entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver which serves about customers Excelergy has implemented its billing product at Boston Gas which serves about customers As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multifaceted billing and customer care system Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the valueadded service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line Obsessively Relentlessly At Your Service The company is obviously making customer service a centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite to support its entry into new markets

Pennsylvania Customers Continues to Go Green By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company reported that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Competitive Default Service Agreeme nt between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost customers The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few days ANALYSIS As you may recall a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount ain about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energys service territory Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately residential electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service provider registered within the state This represented about percent of PECOs residential customer base Three energy providersTNPC Green Mountain and one other unidentified companybid for the customers with various service packages PECO chose TNPC which had offered a fixed discou nt of percent for the residential customers because it believed the offer was in the best interest of PECO customers Green Mountain contested this decision arguing that its hydro and natural gasbased energy package would ultimately be less expensive for consumers and environmentally cleaner Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed offer was a full percent less than PECOs shopping credit compared to TNPCs offer which would average about percent below the shopping credit PECOs response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer Over the last month both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECOs customers which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most successful retail market in the United States if not the world The PUC ruling clearly puts the PECO customers into the hands of TNPC which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing alliance between Enron AOL and IBM Securing the residential customers in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the Pennsylvania market The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not shopped for an alternative supplier under the states electric competition program However what I find most interesting about the latest development in this case is whats happening behind the scenes of the dispute and more specifically how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective I discussed just two weeks ago IssueAlert from Nov that TNPCs stock NYSE NPW was taking a nosedive Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in early October TNPCs IPO offering of million common shares was priced at per share a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has only been in existence since May of this year Momentum grew as the first day of trading saw the stock price climb to Yet contrast that with the current stock price of as of Nov and certainly questions about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge The decline in TNPC stock seemed to start when the company reported a Q loss of million or per share TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due its limited operating history but investors seemed to think otherwise Around the same time that TNPCs stock began to drop the company announced that it would be adding windgenerated energy to its package for customers in the Philadelphia area Under terms of a brandnew agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen t in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania My reaction to this announcemen t was that TNPCs addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain Yet TNPCs move toward renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock price In another ironic twist TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh ip with Green Mountain which was an adversary only last month TNPC disclosed that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition of up to competitive default service customers out of the within PECOs territory Reportedly the relationship will benefit Pennsylvania consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals In addition TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner is consistent with its objective of enhancing a positive customer portfoli o value However considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of the customers from PECO it seems odd that the company would sudden ly be willing to share of them with Green Mountain Certainly Green Mountain wins from this partnership The company gains residential customers when it based on the PUCs ruling could have ended up with nothing The company offers three service packages in Pennsylvania EcoSmart EnviroBlend and Natures Choice varying mixes of hydro natural gas and new renewables with Natures Choice containing more renewables than the other two power blends Marketing power that it bills as dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy What remains very unclear is TNPCs true motivations and the future of the company which made such a big splash when it began operating last spring Is this a classic case of an energy startup chasing down trends eg the current high value of renewable energy stocks in order to rejuvenate itself or a true identity transformation The questions are pertinent as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to struggle DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Strategic and Competitive

IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countri es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will repre sent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europ e to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billi on cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decisi on is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merge r strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategi c contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas tradin g and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci al endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japan s first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals includin g Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From

Columbia By Susan Kellogg Issues Analyst DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD AES Corporation announced further international expansion through its acquisition of KMR Power Corporation KMR a privately owned electric power plant developer and operator in Colombia South America KMR has controlling interest in three natural gasfired power plants having a total capacity of approximately MW AES will be acquiring two of the three natural gasfired power plants located in Cartagena through a interest in the MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a interest in the MW Mamonal plant ANALYSIS AES continues its nonstrategy of acquisitions in the purchase of KMR In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke AES CEO I asked him sever al times about AES strategic plans to which he answered We dont have one Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the megapower company due to its decentralized structure Decisions are made in response to a unique company mission which is to serve the world and steward its resources making clean safe reliable electricity available So why venture into Colombia a hotbed of political and social upheaval with an uncertain business environment A risky business by many energy companies standards But AES has created a dramatic international network guided not essentially by the almighty dollar according to Bakke Well go anywhere we are needed or wanted and can live our values and principle s So given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central America KMR is a prime target AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu lly penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they do what they do best buy command and redirect electric service from that monopoly into a clean reliable and democratically supported power service AES has made headlines throughout the year with its continuing list of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile Bolivia Argentina Dominican Republic El Salvador England Tanzania Venezuela Puerto Rico Brazil Bulgaria Republic of Georgia and most recently Oman The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility CA La Electricidad de Caracas EDC captured the headlines for several months earlier this year AES was involved in what was billed as a hostile takeover in a process that intrigued the energy community AES purchased approximately American Depository Shares ADSs including ADSs subject to guaranteed deliveries representing approximat ely of the outstanding shares Dennis W Bakke commended the Comision Nacio nal de Valores the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission on its final action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts to close the deal But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive signal for foreign investment in Venezuela We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot better job than was being done by EDC We didnt give a second thought about controversy We knew this was the right thing to do Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy and powerful families for many years AES has the clout the money and the mission to go in shake things up and in line with AES goals to create a stronger economy a more competitive society The strategy in Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America Weve made a lot of changes in the company and its not only going to change Venezuela but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor ing states as well Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission although admitti ng that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge Our position and principles seem to always be under attack said Bakke I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees its role in the world the way we do But our purpose has grown over the years and actually deepened as weve expanded further and further into the world AES has had another winning year A world leader in generation its value has doubled in the past year Generating assets include one hundred and twentyfive facilities totaling over MW of capacity world wide Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi c philosophy So far AES seems to have been touched by an angel in its endeavors into areas where others fear to tread For the complete

about the dialogue taking place was that despite participation from diverse sectors of the energy industryutilities regulators consultants ESPs IT infrastructure providers and othersseveral key points were reiterated throughout the discussion First there is little doubt left that ecommerce and new technologies are changing the entire complexion of the energy industry Resulting from that dynamic energy companies presently find themselves in a transformatio n related to how they will and should conduct their businesses While new technologies certainly offer new opportunities for companies to expand information and services that already exist in an electronic form question s still remain about how much the market itself will bear in terms of buildin g new online exchanges for ecommerce As noted the conference focused on online exchanges Within my presentatio n I discussed that essentially four different kinds of exchanges have emerged within the last months supply chain commodity trading transmission and retail exchanges A supply chain exchange exists primarily to line up buyers and sellers of parts related to the energy industry with the end goals of lower product prices and procurement processing costs exposur e to a worldwide audience and shorter order and fulfillment cycles A commod ity trading exchange exists for companies engaged in bulk wholesale trading to buy and sell energy packages A new form of exchange is emerging with transmission exchanges We dont know a whole lot about them yet but a group of utilities in the Midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange that would be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around transmission assets and the market How a transmission exchange would correlate with an RTOwhich also manages transmission flowis not yet clear Finally the retail online providers could also be considered a form of exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the Internet With that established several key issues will rise to the forefront in as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment enters its second year First and foremost establishing neutrality seems to be the primary challenge Questions were raised at the conference about trading exchanges established by a proprietary participant that is involved in every buy or sell on that particular exchange The general consensus among those present at the conference was that although concerns about neutrality have not prevented exchanges such as EnronOnline from becoming very successful regulatory pressure from the FTC may eventually make neutrality a requirement In addition when given a choice over various exchanges on which to participate the sense that I got from the dialogue was that traders would arguably prefer to participate on an exchange where issues of disclosing competitive information are not a concern The second trend as we move forward is liquidity With regard to commodity exchanges what participants want and what makes an exchange the most successful is liquidity meaning essentially the amount of transactions on the excha nge and consequently the opportunity to access beneficial deals A point that I made in my presentation is that the larger exchanges naturally seem to have the most liquidity Again the example of EnronOnline which reportedly has now logged over billion in transactions cannot be overlooked This raises the question of whether or not smaller exchanges will even find opportunities to move into such a saturated market As a result a related trend that I see is the consolidation of existing exchanges along with a blending of current business models into one exchange format As companies realize that it is already fairly late in the game to be building an exchange the smart move may be to join or merge with an alreadyexistin g format I think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to gain a lock on various market niches The third trend that should emerge over the next year is the separation of commodities Traders will want the flexibility of having separate platfo rms for different commodities including power natural gas bandwidth etc Dynegydirect is already moving in that direction by offering separate tradi ng floors that allow traders to group products in a customized way I think we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option The trends I mentioned here have focused mostly on commodity trading That is primarily due to the fact that we simply dont know enough about how several prominent supply chain exchanges will operate Enporion just last week logged its first transactions five reverse auctions in which UGI was the buyer of natural gas Pantellos still has another month or so before it comes online Of course there are many smaller supply chain exchanges like UtilityFrontier municipaloriented RAPIDpartsmart and Bexcom but the general consensus at the conference was that all supply chain exchanges will need to provide significant cost savings for participants and that has yet to be universally demonstrated Most observers of this particular trend are reserving judgment until next year when realtime results are disclosed Moreover the evolving energy marketplace is providing many new opportuniti es for energy companies to redefine themselves and develop new business models However much of the water that energy companies may be venturing into is uncharted territory The risks and competition associated with building an online exchange can be formidable and may dissuade some energy companie s from developing in that direction The question is as we move further down the path of an ebased energy industry can energy companies avoid participation in some form of an exchange As always the answer will proba bly be found along the bottom line which for many of these exchanges should emerge sometime over the next year DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

equity investmen t from PGE Find out more about SCIENTECHS ECommerce InfoGrid at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October TXU Sued By Texas Cities Over Franchise Fees By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The City of Denton Texas has filed a lawsuit against TXU Electric Gas claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid Denton its franchise fees by not accurately reporting its gross revenues on which franchise fees are based To date cities have signed resolutions to join Denton in the lawsuit and more are expected An initial audit by Denton claims that the amount that TXU owes could potentially exceed million ANALYSIS Over this last year several utilities in Texas have come under fire for allegedly not paying the full amount of franchise fees for which various cities claim they are obligated This suit against TXU is just the latest but it follows a judgment against Reliant Energy earlier this spring and a pending suit against CPL a subsidiary of AEPCSW Franchise fees are essentially rental payments that a city has the right to charge a utility for use of the citys public streets and grounds for the placement of pipelines poles and utility cables Texas state law allow s cities to charge utilities percent of their gross revenues for the right to franchises within a citys limits Some utilities such as Reliant entere d into agreementsstretching back to the sthat obligate them to pa y percent of gross revenues earned in a city in exchange for year franchises In any case the cities are arguing that franchise fees should be based on gross revenue not net revenue that the utilities have earned from providing service within the city limits Herein lies the core of the litigation as in this case the City of Denton is claiming that TXU intentionally reported lower gross revenue thereby reducing the amount it was required to pay to Denton and the other cities involved in the lawsuit The cities involved in the suit claim they are entitled to not only unpaid franchise fees from TXU but punitive damages as well The prognosis may not be very good for TXU if a similar case against Relia nt Energy is any indication In May a Houston jury ruled that ReliantHLP acted with malice by intentionally underpaying cities for decades for the exclusive right to sell electricity in those cities The state distric t court ordered HLP to pay million to the cities of Pasadena Galvesto n and Wharton The award consisted of million in punitive damages anothe r million because it was determined that HLP had defrauded the cities and million in actual damages That seemed to be just the start of Reliants problems as following that case additional cities including Houston came together and launched a classaction suit against Reliant HLP again claiming that the utility intentionally underpaid franchise fees for the sole right to provide power in the cities This lawsuit is claiming million in damages the bulk of which million is allott ed for the City of Houston However illustrating how polarized this issue is just last week a state district judge overturned the million ruling for the first three cities and reduced the damages down to million In addition the same judge overturned the separate ruling that had given the green light for the cities to proceed with the classaction suit Both rulings are still being appealed by the cities in hopes to reinstate the award for fraud and punitive damages In addition the cities involved in the new lawsuit against Reliant are proceedingjust with individual cases instead of one Sound confusing It certainly is and it will no doubt amount to one big mess if the cities are not permitted to band together in one classaction suit Heres Reliants position in the litigation which is presently supported by the Texas State District Court Reliant claims that transactions that do not generate profits or represent the selling of power in a citysuch as reconnection fees renting pole space to other utilities and sending electricity to other marketsshould not be considered part of gross reve nue and therefore not subject to franchise fees Thus the figure Reliant reported as gross revenue may indeed be lower than the cities expected it to bebut it is an accurate number based on Reliants interpretation As noted CPL is also involved in a pending lawsuit with the City of San Juan Texas and a group of about other cities These cities claim that CPL underpaid franchise fees and seek damages of up to million plus attorneys fees CPL has filed a counterclaim for overpayment of franchise fees and intends to defend itself against the cities claims How all of this will impact the case against TXU is unclear but certainly the momentum is growing against the utilities in Texas TXU like Reliant and CPL maintains that it has done nothing wrong and that it has paid in full all of the fees owed to the over Texas cities and towns to which it provides electric service Again the center of the dispute lies in how to calculate gross revenues TXU contends that gross revenue include s only the direct proceeds it has received from the sale of electricity and natural gas The City of Denton on the other hand argues that gross reven ue also should include other income such as taxes and fees collected for bad checks which conceivably could result in a much higher figure especially when calculated over a year period TXU had operating revenues of approximately billion so like Reliant a settlement in the million range would not wield much financ ial impact However more important to these utilities may be the fact that this could be just the beginning of a string of similar lawsuits brought forward by cities across Texas Consider the class action suit against Reliant to the tune of million If that suit is allowed to proceed were talking about big money especially when attorney fees are added to the equation In addition the reputation of these utilities is at stake The cities initiating the lawsuits are using such terms as unlawful busine ss practices and claiming that every dollar utilities like TXU and Reliant have not paid to the cities means a dollar increase in taxes for citizens As deregulation continues to unfold a utilitys reputation will be one of the foundations on which it attracts new customers and retains current ones Its also important to note that under Texas restructuring law once competition begins in the state January the formula to determine franchise fees in the state will switch from a revenue formula to a consumption formula In other words the amount that utilities collected as gross revenue in will be divided by the amount of total kilowatt hours consumed within the city limits during the same year and that will be the amount of the franchise fee owed by utilities to cities The franchise fee shall be equal to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours delivered within the city limits Of course all of these pending lawsuits are bringing into question the amount of gross revenue that was collected during which might make this formula difficult to calculate In any case I dont see these issues subsiding any time soon as they are based on a fundamentally different interpretation of how to define gross revenue The real winners in these lawsuits may be the attorneys themselves as undoubtedly these cases will remain in litigation for several years

our interview with a leader in the industy webinfostorensfProductsPowerHitter DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Toronto Hydro Ontario Power Generation Launch EBT Express By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they have launched an electronic business transaction EBT hub that will provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services to local distribution companies LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario Called EBT Express the exchange will become operational when Ontarios new competitive electricity market opens next spring Excelergy eXACTv developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation will provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express ANALYSIS This is a significant development as EBT Express represents the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions The site will serve as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario and possibly throughout Canada I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur Exelergys vice president Canada about EBT Express Caraghiaur believes that the site will provide the essential technology for opening Ontarios electrici ty market in an efficient manner That is no small undertaking as there are an expected players that will need to communicate with each other in Ontario once competition begins Deregulation is happening in Canada on a provincebyprovince basis much like it is happening statebystate in the US Thus far only Ontario and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select a new energy supplier Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next spring and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be operational Alberta uses a pointtopoint transaction process which represents a very complex model Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be clearly seen and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta and elsewhere The Ontario Energy Board OEB which is the equivalent of a state PUC mandated the use of electronic business transactions EBTs The EBTs work as follows Once a customer selects a new energy supplier the energy suppl ier and the local distribution company LDC must continue to share information about that customer This proprietary data shared strictly on a onetoone basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only will include billing usage and payment information Essentially an LDC will read the meter and send usage information to the energy supplier who will calculate its portion of a customers bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC which will submit the customer bill This represents a common way for billi ng in Ontario although there are other options including consolidated billing that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from both the LDC and energy supplier No customer information will be exchanged until competition officially begins in Ontario which now appears to be in the spring of although the technology infrastructure supplied by Excelergy is already in place In response to the OEBs mandate Toronto Hydro Corp and Ontario Power Generationthe largest players in electricity distribution and generatio n in Ontario became equity partners in the million joint venture to create EBT Express All customer data will be contained within EBT Express which is supported by the eXACT technology Excelergy eXACT is a software solution that translates validates manages and delivers data exchanged among users The functionality of eXACT has been used in several US state s including Pennsylvania and New Jersey In fact eXACT was introduced to gas and electricity retailers in the United States in as a component of Excelergy ABPv a billing and customer information solution Alleghen y Energy Supply a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy was one US utility that I know of that used the Excelergy technology Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci ng the competitive market in Ontario There are presently licensed retaile rs in Ontario pending retailers and LDCs Caraghiaur told me You can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express The numbe r of LDCs seemed awfully high to me but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario many LDCs serve only a small number of customers often customers or less This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in Ontario but when compared to the United States Ontario still will have a comparatively high number of distribution companies Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried to assimilate communication among many market participants Pennsylvania along with most other US states still uses electronic data interchange EDI as its standard wherein every LDC has a slightly different interpretation of data that is shared through the EDI This can often cause communication inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready for deregulation EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards says Caraghiaur The use of XML in particular will enhance communication between market participants In fact XML extensible market language is the cornerstone of eXACT as it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but still understood by different applications Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg y is on the forefront of XML technology which was expressly stipulated in the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy Board XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible In addition Excelergys eXACT software is objectoriented allowing for easy and rapid change from one program to another Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry Whereas states that previously deregulated such as California and Pennsylvania did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information states and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them For instance Excelergys competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse built for the Midwest market Also the ERCOTISO has teamed with Andersen Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling scheduled for pilot in the summer of and full market opening in Januar y One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer data through EBT Express especially when it is backed by potential competitors in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power Caraghiaur responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer information through an EBT structure However market participants are not mandated to participate in EBT Express They could opt to still exchang e information on a pointtopoint basis although Caraghiaur believes that EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer data In addition Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC and energy supplier involved in the exchange Interestingly Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when the Ontario market opens next year Toronto Hydro Corp owns Toronto HydroElectric System Limited a regulated electricity distribution system and Toronto Hydro Energy Services a competitive energy service company Ontario Power Generation is an electricity generating company so Toronto Hydro and Ontar io Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply contra cts with lucrative customers And rumor has it that venerable retail giant Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada next year As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market

latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

Take on Challenges Opportunities of Being Wirecoms at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Enron Offers to Buy Out Azurix By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Enron Corp announced that it has offered up to million in funding to take Azurix Corp NYSE AZX private at a buyout price of per share Enron owns directly and indirectly about percent of Azurix a global water company that owns operates and manages water and wastewater assets and provides related services The specific structure and timing of Enrons proposal has yet to be determined but the companys board is now consideri ng the proposal ANALYSIS Azurix has been plagued with operational and financial problems over the last months culminating in the departure of its former CEO Rebecca Mark in late August Enron had established Azurix in July with a billion acquisition of Britains Wessex Water which provides water and wastewater services to a UK population of approximately million Operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America Argentina and Brazil Azurix was intended to be Enrons vehicle to capitalize on what it perceived to be favorable market conditions for water investments Yet Azurix has not been a profitable operation for Enron and has been seen as a real anomaly when compared against Enrons consistent success in its other ventures for example EnronOnline For instance Azurix reported yearend net income of million significantly under projections for what Enron had hoped for the subsidiary After months of speculation Mark stepped down both as Azurix CEO and from the Enron board of directors and was replaced by John Garrison Jr Mark maintained throughout her tenur e as CEO of Azurix that the company needed time to develop core assets and capabilities However this approach was in stark contrast to Enrons guidi ng philosophyas espoused by COO Jeffrey Skillingwhich has moved the co mpany away from owning hard assets Skilling also believed that although acquiri ng the Wessex operation gave Azurix the engineering capability and industry knowledge to participate in the water business privatization of the water industry has slowed down considerably since the company began to penetrate this market Instead of pursuing a capitalintensive strategy for Azurix Skilling wanted Azurix to become more of a serviceoriented business This change in business direction coincided with the departure of Mark Yet Azurix has continued to flounder even since Mark left In the third quarter of this year Enron reportedly lost million in its corporate and other category and attributed a fourth of the loss to the Azurix operation Azurixs stock price started a marked decline in early August when it was announced that annual results would not meet analysts expectations While Azurix was taken public in June at a price of per share it curren tly is priced at at close of the markets on Oct This is an approximately increase from what Azurix had been trading at recently presumably due to Enrons announcement of the proposed buyout Enrons buyout offer comes after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix Reportedly three out of the four potenti al buyers were unwilling to pay more than per share although one of the buyers initially considered an offer of per share but ultimately decide d against the purchase Enrons motivation in returning Azurix to a private status is probably one of protecting its shareholders Enron pointed out in its announcement that shareholders would receive on a timely basis a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price of the shares at which Azurix has traded over the last several months Making matters worse for Enron a group of plaintiffs represented by New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian Feffer LLP have initiated a classaction lawsuit against Azurix in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas The plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all investors who purchased Azurix stock during the period of June the date of Azurixs IPO and Aug and who suffe red damages as a result The law firm is claiming that Azurix violated the Federal securities laws I placed a call to the law firm this morning in hopes of getting additional information about what the classaction suit entails Unfortunately I did not receive a call back before press time The consensus among the vast majority of US energy companies is that the profitability of water as a convergence strategy is questionable The most obvious negative about the water business is that it most likely will remain a heavily regulated delivery business offering few opportunities for private companies to penetrate the market Water is a very staid busine ss that seems inconsistent with Enrons aggressive growth strategy After Enron secures a fair return for Azurixs shareholders it is not clear what the company will do with its water subsidiary but I would not be surprised if Azurix is sold to another company However in Augustright before Marks departureAzurix announced that it had begun a pilot progr am in the Lower Rio Grande using its Internet exchange WaterWatercom The site will provide users with information price transparency and efficiency in water exchanges This announcement indicated that Azurix would begin trading water rights adding this commodity to the growing list of Enrons traded commodities energy telecom weather derivatives etc So it may be the case that Enron keeps Azurix but turns it into a water trading operation as opposed to water and wastewater services In any case the present objective for Enron will be financing the buyout and ensuring that Azurixs shareholders receive a significant premium to the market price of Azurix Enron also wants to ensure other benefits to Azurix including a significant nearterm reduction in Azurixs general and administrative expenses greater certainty to Azurixs customers and employees and increas ed flexibility for restructuring Azurixs assets and business DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and

Sing Some Utilities Take on Challenges Opportunities of Being Wirecoms at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November NiSource and Columbia Energy Group Complete Merger By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD NiSource Inc and Columbia Energy Group received approval for their merger from the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and are expected to close their transaction today The combined company will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as NiSource NYSE NI Columbia Energ y Group shares NYSE CG will cease trading before the market opens Nov ANALYSIS Its been a long and rocky road to say the least for the billion marriage between these two companies which reportedly will create the largest US naturalgas distributor east of the Rocky Mountains The union started out as a hostile takeover in June when NiSource began making several attempts to purchase all outstanding common shares of Columb ia Energy Group CEG All of NiSources offers were rejected by CEG In fact up until just a year ago CEG fiercely fought the takeover claiming that due to financial and operational problemsNiSource was not an appropriate ma rriage partner However after about eight months of offers and rebuffs with NiSource offering as much as a share Columbia Energy Group finally consented to the billion offer ironically based on Columbias February stock value of a share and consequently lower than NiSources previous offers The merger creates a company that could gain a strong lock on the naturalg as market in a corridor stretching from Texas to Maine Merrillville Indbas ed NiSource is a holding company parent company to NIPSCO and Bay State Gas among several other distribution companies with operations in electric naturalgas and water distribution in the Midwest and Northeastern United States Its generation portfolio includes four coalfired generating statio ns two hydroelectric generating plants and four gasfired combustion plants NiSource also markets unregulated energy services in key competitive areas CEG based in Herndon Va is an energy services company with assets of approximately billion and ownership of miles of interstate gas pipelines that run from Louisiana to the Northeast CEG is engaged in nearl y all aspects of the naturalgas business including exploration and producti on transmission storage and distribution as well as propane and petroleum product sales and electric power generation Under the terms of the merger agreement NiSource is offering shares for each Columbia common share CEG shareholders can elect to receive New NiSource stock or receive a combination of in cash plus in securities Just today NiSource revised its estimate of the number of CEG shares elect ing to receive NiSource stock upward to approximately percent from its origi nal estimate of percent Regarding current stock performance NiSource share s closed on Oct not far from a week high of Shares of CEG closed at Upon completion of the merger the companies will create a new holding company as of yet unnamed under which NiSource and CEG will become wholly owned subsidiaries Together the companies will serve approximately million customers The companies have identified their postmerger strategy as growth in energy supply and distribution as well as the development of new energy choices through emergent technologies The regulatory approval process for the NiSource CEG merger went comparatively smoothly finishing just eight months after the formal announcement of the merger Yet the SEC gave its approval to the merger on an important condition Under the laws of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of PUHCA the SEC has required NiSource to divest of IWC Resources its water operations subsidiary based in Indianapolis Under PUHCA utility holding companies are required to divest operations that are not integral to their primary operations The divestiture must take place within three years to comply with US legislation according to NiSource Although the merger is small in comparison to recent megamergers between AEP CSW and PECO Unicom this partnership is important Its not surprising that NiSource pursued CEG so diligently as the acquisition of CEG more than doubles the size of NiSource and changes it from a predominantly elect ric company to a gas transmission and distribution company with electric operations NiSource will own a naturalgas business extending from Chicago to New England reportedly placing it as the nations thirdlargest naturalgas company largest in the West The completion of the merger comes at an ideal time for NiSource just as reports of a shortage in naturalgas suppl y indicate that the prices for natural gas will rise significantly this winte r and into next year As a leading supplier NiSource will be sitting in a prime position However the divestiture of IWC Resources is a clear downside to this merge r at least from NiSources point of view Of all the players that have penetrated the water industry and then retreated for example Enron and Duke NiSour ce was one of the few that stood out as having some success in this heavily regulated market In fact up until recently NiSource had claimed that its growth strategy was to build a distribution chain around the core naturalgas electricity and water distribution businesses More than being a significan t money maker for the company NiSources water business provided a steady cash flow and perhaps more importantly access to additional energy customers Water customers as an aggregated group can be very valuable for an energy company The company that controls water services has another stable base of customers to which it can sell electric and gas services For instance NiSource had purchased IWC in part to prevent its competitor IPALCO Enterprises from obtaining the water customer list in this service territory The bottom line of this merger may be that while other companies are focus ing on building critical mass the New NiSource is carving out a specific niche naturalgas services in a targeted market Texas to Northeast The fact that it will no longer own IWC Resources may pale in comparison to the projected growth that the New NiSource may find in the naturalgas business Of particular importance to this new company is the ownership of miles of interstate gas pipelines gained from CEG Owning a significant supply of natural gas in a very tight market may become the real secret advantage of this merger DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more

Bullock CoFounder President and CEO of Excelergy is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November FERC Proposes Major Changes to Californias Wholesale Market By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a draft order outlin ing a major overhaul of the California wholesale market including changes to market rules concerning the California ISO CalISO and Power Exchange PX Conceding that the market rules and structure for wholesale sales of electricity are flawed and have caused unjust and unreasonable rates FERC has proposed a number of remedies that will become effective in approximately days The full commission is expected to vote on the draft order in December after a period of industry comment ANALYSIS FERC based its page draft order on several assumptions and through the order intends to offer longterm rather than bandaid solutio ns First FERC wants to hold overall rates to competitive levels that benefit consumers while at the same time induce sufficient investment in capacity to ensure adequate service Second FERC acknowledged that some matters that have adversely impacted the California wholesale market are not under its jurisdiction but that of the CPUC Thus FERC focused on matters withi n its exclusive jurisdiction even if some of the proposals preempt prior state decisions while at the same time urging the state of California to rectify issues within its own jurisdiction This is an important point as FERC maintains that unless the CPUC addresses issues such as the inadequate siting of generation and transmission and demandside response California customers may still be exposed to higher prices that result from low supply Third FERC could find no evidence of market power abuses although it did concede that the market in California certainly allows the opportunity for market abuse when energy supplies are tight Further FERC contends that California IOUs have been bidding up to percent of their load into the dayahead market and hourahead spot markets creating substantial shortterm cost exposure Due to regulatory restrictio ns from Californias restructuring law AB the IOUs were not able to pursue a balanced portfolio including longterm and intermediate contracts The central mission of FERCs order is to remove the restrictions that kept California IOUs from moving significant amounts of wholesale transacti ons into forward markets The less reliant that the IOUs become on spot markets so goes FERCs theory the less chance of price volatilitywhich should not only reduce costs for customers but also increase reliability and increase prospects for new generation With that established heres what FERCs order prescribes Eliminate the requirement that Californias three IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE must sell into and buy from the PX This proposal essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers which was previously restricted under AB Require market participants to schedule percent of their transactions in the dayahead markets A penal ty charge will be affixed for deviations in scheduling in excess of percent of an entitys hourly load requirements Disbursement of penalty revenues will be distributed to the loads that scheduled accurately The establishment of independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the California ISO and PX The establishment of generation interconnection procedures FERC wants the CPUC to address the following issues delays in siting additions of generation and transmission capacity implementation of additional deman d response programs at the retail level and elimination of impediments on load serving entities pursuing power supplies on a forward basis Perhaps most contentious within the order is FERCs decision to set a MWh rate cap so that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing price that is paid to all bidders This policy negates a previous proposal from the CalISO under which it lobbied for a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market FERCs order freezes the ISO bid cap at its current level for the next days However beyond that FERC is instating what is being referred to as a soft price cap of MWh to remain in place until December Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generato r setting a bid above MWh must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny The order revealed again some dissension with the FERC itself Although generally the four commissioners that delivered the order Hoecker Massey Breathitt and Hbert probably would agree that it is not perfect Commissioner Hebert voiced the strongest disagreement with the orders principles Hber t hesitantly concurred with the order although he believed the commission went too far in its attempt to mitigate prices something he believes FERC is illequipped to do Specifically Hbert dissented with the decision to place any sort of price cap on wholesale transactions preferring instea d as he has advocated throughout his tenure as a FERC commissionerto entrus t market participants with the ability and responsibility to mitigate their price exposure as they deem best Moreover it is questionable whether or not FERC has achieved its goals of providing longterm solutions to Californias problems Rather it seems that the commission is sending a mixed message On one hand it is allowing the California IOUs the freedom to buy and sell power outside of the PX which seems like a very procompetition policy Yet on the other hand FERC establishes a price cap albeit a soft not hard one on wholesale transactions which arguably will continue to restrict true competitive market forces from materializing in California The commission is sending a clear signal that all bids should be under MWh and will undergo interrogation if they are not which essentially puts political pressure on suppliers to maintain a price cap However if one of the clear goals of this proposed order is to bring down energy prices for California customers removing the requirement of the IOUs to buy and sell through the PX may actually accomplish this The propo sal changes the California structure to one in which local distribution compani es LDCs could possibly wield more market power than the energy suppliers who essentially controlled prices when going through the PX If the LDCs know how to work economic deals in which they set the price for the power they purchase this could ultimately drive energy costs down for customers As noted FERC will vote on the proposed order in December after receiving commentary from industry participants FERC Chair James Hoecker already knows the position of one major player He received a letter from Enron CEO Kenneth Lay just this week in which Lay urged FERC to avoid placing price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds Lay further predicted that installing price caps would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods and stated that a capped formula would encourage naturalgas suppliers to deploy their turbines in other states or countries In addition several consumer advocate groups have expressed anger that FERC did not order refunds for San Diego customer s who bore the brunt of high energy prices this summer In fairness to FERC it is questionable whether or not the commission has the legal authority to provide a refund to San Diego customers as it did not find any evidence of market manipulation Thus there is little chance that we will see the end of the debate over California any time soon Rather FERCs order which presents itself as a remedy to conflicts surrounding the wholesale market has shown just how polarized adversaries are within this debate Yet I believe the bottom line of the proposed order is that it is a good first step to addressing the fundamental problems within Californias wholesale market and marks a significant start to what will undoubtedly be an ongoing discussion DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD For additional background coverage of the problems related to the wholesale market in California please visit SCIENTECHs

Expo in Phoenix Arizona November Hear JON BROCK Director of Strategic and Competitive Intelligence SCIENTECHRCI address the ramifications of legislative and regulatory requirements on your Information Technology Infrastructure DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November AEP Restructures Moves Away from Distribution Focus By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Earlier this week AEP announced its plans to restructure into two companie s to support a new focus on power generation marketing and trading Our focus for moving forward plain and simple will be the wholesale business generation and related energy assets wholesale marketing and trading said Dr Linn Draper AEPs CEO Draper added that AEP has no plans to expand its utility distribution operations in the United States and overseas ANALYSIS First lets be clear about what AEP is doing Under the restructuring one corporation will hold AEPs utility and nonutility subsidiaries whose revenues are derived from competitive unregulated business ventures The second corporation will hold AEPs utility subsidiaries primarily TD subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by at least one state regulatory commission or foreign subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs regulation This announcement represents a degree turn from what AEP has previously espoused as its competitive strategy both during and after the recent completion of its merger with CSW Its not so surprising that AEP would want to focus on generating marketing and trading or separate its highri sk and lowrisk operations into two companies Whats most surprising about this restructuring is AEPs move away from the TD side of its business since up until a few weeks ago distribution remained a key part of AEPs core business strategy For instance when the merger with CSW was completed in June Draper said AEPs postmerger strategy consists of three key elements wholesale energy delivery and retail The two that will be most important for us initially are the wholesale and energy delivery businesses This made sense because as a combined company the new AEP owns more than miles of transmission lines and miles of distribution lines As recently as October this remained AEPs strategy Draper told me in an exclusive interview At least for the foreseeable future being in the distribution business is a good idea Were not going to make a fortune at it because rates are continually going to be regulated by state commissions but AEP is going to be in the wires business If anything Draper question ed whether or not AEP would remain in the retail business as he was unsure that AEP was skilled enough to succeed in this end of the business Thus this seemingly sudden decision to put no further emphasis on expandin g the TD operation is rather surprising We can speculate about the various reasons why AEP would be changing its path For starters unquestionably AEPs wholesale generation and trading business has grown considerably over the last two years According to figures released this week in AEPs Fact Book presented at the EEI Financial Conference earlier this week the companys trading volumes continue to increase Q reflects millionMWh compared to millionMWh in Q Thirdquarter figures were not yet available Regarding gross profits for the first six months of trading contributed million while wholesale marketing contributed million On the other hand the regulated TD business currently is characterized by both slow growth and a low rate of return Thus it would make little sense for AEP to continue to expand this part of its business as further expansion would bring little value to its shareholders This theory may be supported by the fact that Draper clearly stated the restructuring is focused on obtaining higher profit margins in the unregulated wholesale energy markets I confirmed this with a quick call to AEP yester day afternoon I was told by my contact there that from this point any discretionary cash is going into the wholesale side By splitting the companys operatio ns in two undivided attention can now be placed on growing the unregulated side of the business where AEPs sees the most growth for its operation For the most part separating its business into two companiesessentiall y one regulated and other unregulatedappears to be a smart move for AEP as the two business offer strikingly different risk portfolios The restructuring is part of a growing trend among companies that have scale on both the generation and TD sides and realize these two very different operations attract a different kind of investor Just recently Reliant Energy announc ed that it is initiating a similar restructuring separating into two publicly traded companies one regulated and one unregulated Reliants decision was motivated in part because of Texas mandate that utilities in the state must construct firewalls between their operating companies In other words Texas utilities must have separate companieswith separate financial rec ords for energy services distribution generation etc Yet beyond the mandate it is a smart move for Reliant because it can now attract two different sets of investorsone attracted to highrisk ventures and the other aver se to them In addition highrisk ventures such as power generation marketin g and trading telecom etc will not have a negative impact on the unregula ted companys stock value The same logic applies to the restructuring that AEP has announced Other companies that recently have spun off highrisk subsidiaries into separate companies are Southern Company Southern Energy and Xcel Energy NRG Energy Inc One difference between these examples and AEP is that AEP has not confirmed that its two companies will become two standalone publicly traded compani es Draper has said that the company is reserving that decision until the end of next year the time at which he believes the restructuring will have received all the necessary regulatory approvals considering how long the AEPCSW merger took to complete the restructuring could take longer than a year Draper did allude to the fact that AEP has a number of options to consider This statement may or may not support speculation that the company is planning an imminent acquisition one that might dramatically expand its generation portfolio and further support its trading and wholesa le marketing efforts In addition I think its valid to speculate that AEP might eventually divest itself of the TD business altogether Certainly the restructuring does not place this end of the companys business very high on the totem pole as it was only a few months ago Another question that probably cannot be answered at this point is whether or not AEP as a holding company will remain under regulation from the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of PUHCA After the restructuri ng has been completed AEP will have several options It could operate as it is now that is with a holding company structure under which the two standalone corporations would be held Or it could issue two IPOs for the two companies Assuming that after the restructuring has been completed AEP decides to issue IPOs for both its unregulated and regulated companies thereby eliminating a holding company entity it is questionable whether or not AEP would still be bound by PUHCA restrictions This could be an important part of AEPs strategy regarding the restructuring As AEP contin ues to compete in deregulated markets it faces an array of restrictions under PUHCA that for example Enron does not face as it is not a registered holding company Disengaging itself from PUHCA restrictions assuming that PUHCA has not been repealed by that point would certainly offer AEP a new level of competitive agility However perhaps most interesting of all will be what AEP decides to do with its TD business which represents approximately million customers that are connected to AEPs transmission system Certainly once this regulated business is fully separated from the deregulated businesses AEP will be able to do a more accurate costbenefit analysis and determine if it wants to remain in the TD business at all DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Waltham Massbased Evergreen Solar Inc Nasdaq ESLR issued an initial public offering of shares of its common stock at the IPO price of per share Evergreen Solar develops manufactures and markets solar power cells panels and systems throughout the world The IPO reportedly will raise million in gross proceeds to support further expansion and development by Evergreen Solar ANALYSIS Heres yet another case of a relatively unknown company going public based on grand marketing ideas rather than a solid track record Yet surprisingly the IPO has opened strong Last Thursday Evergreen Solars stock closed percent above its offering price at At the close of the market on Friday the stock price had dropped to but still represented a strong showing while other IPOs last week both energy and nonenergy have crashed and burned Excelergy for example What makes the strong IPO even more startling is Evergreen Solars lessthanstellar financial history Since its inception in Evergreen has incurred significant net losses million in million in and million for the first six months of As a result of ongoing operating losses Evergreen has a cumulative net loss of million as of June and has stated clearly that it expects to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable In product sales only accounted for percent of total revenue with the rest coming from research grants Granted Evergreen is still in startup mode with regard to a largescale production of its business but still it seems very odd to see such a strong IPO from a company that is really just getting started So what gives Doesnt it seem logical that a company should demonstrate financial stability before it goes public And that if its not financially stable the stock price should go down and not up Ill provide one theory but first lets establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about The companys sales since have been composed primarily of solar panels Evergreen plans to begin largescale manufacturing of its solar power products in a new manufacturing facility in early a growth strategy that the IPO proceeds obviously would support Evergreens principal objective is to become a leading producer of highquality solar power products primarily for the ongrid market and the offgrid rural electrification market What makes the company unique according to Evergreen is its String Ribbon technology which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon which is required for most solarpower technologies Evergreens String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half which reduces manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability In December Evergreen Solar formed a fiveyear strategic distribution and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market Essentially Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively through Kawasaki In fact the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreens business In the first six months of sales to Kawasaki accounted for approximately percent of Evergreens product revenues After the IPO Kawasaki will have an percent stake in Evergreen The risks associated with Evergreens business are formidable and the company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly revenue continues to be disappointing Beyond that Evergreens success hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market which is still in question Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies pointofuse electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the electric grid will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the global electric power market and within DG technologies solar power has experienced significant growth over the last years In addition solar power produces zero emissions and may grow as a result of renewable energy requirements in various states This may be true but at the same time there are other competing DG technologies such as fuel cells microturbines and wind power which may slow the grow of solar power Plus theres little proof that Evergreens String Ribbon technology will produce significant costsavings to make it a standout technology There are other risks as well not the least of which is the exclusive relationship with Kawasaki If the relationship goes sour this could dramatically diminish Evergreens potential revenues and market share So with this market profile the question of why Evergreen had such a strong IPO still remains I think the answer is that Evergreens business focus is exclusively placed on alternative power At a time when ecommerce stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success stocks based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that distributed generation technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years Commercial and industrial customers want various options that can reduce their dependence on the grid With regard to alternative fuels and distributed generation technologies investors may believe that either utilities or large endusers will begin to develop these technologies as deregulation continues Remember Active Power Nasdaq ACPW whose shares soared on expectations that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology On its opening day in August Active Power stock increased by percent from the opening price of to Although Active Powers stock price has bounced around since then it still closed at on Nov a very respectable level and approximately percent above its original price Another example is Capstone Turbine Nasdaq CPST which is currently trading at after opening at in June Along with alternative fuels venture capitalists also appear to be responding to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services to energy companies Then there is the growing market of exchanges such as Pantellos Enporion Enermetrix and the like which could be the next big round of successful IPOs The longterm question is how long such stocks can continue to open so successfully without having a strong financial performance to support the opening Ecommerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two ago but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded to see the money Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following a similar path which makes time a critical factor The bottom line is that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial climate remains strong Hear JON BROCK Director of Strategic and Competitive Intelligence SCIENTECHRCI address the ramifications of legislative and regulatory requirements on your Information

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance or Lack Thereof of Information Technology in the Energy Industry By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the CEO Mega Panel View From the Top at the th annual EEIAGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc e in Phoenix this week The moderator was Charles Bayless former chairman president and CEO of Illinova The remaining three CEOs included Keith Stamm CEO Aquila Energy Dr Matthew Cordaro president and CEO Midwest ISO and James Pignatelli chairman president and CEO UniSource Energy ANALYSIS This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner The conference organizers did a good job in getting a crosssection of the energy industry in transition The trading organization specialist was represented with Aquila the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes t ISO and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource Energy Each panelist was asked what role information technology IT played in their respective organization Their answers may surprise you Dr Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first Dr Cordaro stressed that IT was very critical to the operation of an ISO saying it is essentially the foundation of the ISO He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions every week in a realtime operation Among the responsibilities that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are monitoring the congestion on the grid and taking appropriate action preventing gaming through market monitoring settlement processing who owes who what and handling the dispute process The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati on RTO Alliance on July of this year to deliver an integrated control center system ICCS that when complete will provide million in infrastructure for the MISO The RTO Alliance which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation of Seattle Open Access Technology International OATI of Minneapolis Perot Systems of Dallas Texas and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City Utah will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission The hardware and software in the ICCS project will support MISOs operational functions including transmission planning reservation scheduling realtime monitor ing and control settlement and billing Dr Cordaro also stated that Lodestar was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to ATT Solutions Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next Keith began by clarifying Aquilas focus as trading owning very little assets in a highvolume lowmargin highvolatility business IT is very important in the trading business Realtime information must be known and disseminated appropriately to the right individuals Keith believes that one of Aquilas strategic asset s and strengths is its risk management system Aquila strives for a realtim e calculation of risk Aquila Energy a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc has been a surprisin g winner in the trading marketplace this year showing a percent growth since last year with billion total revenue for the past six months of that million in trading revenue compared to million in The EBIT was million vs million a year ago Aquila has gathered top traders and intellectual financial and risk management personnel to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies including top traders AEP and Duke Energy as an investment step Aquila perceived was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin g platforms The Energy Trading Consortium Duke Energy AEP Aquila Energy Reliant Energy Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy is in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap benefits from the transaction cost liquidity volume and speed of exchange This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to onetomany Another competitor recently launched is eSpeeds TradeSpark James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial statements concerning information technology James stated that IT in the vertically integrated utility is not strategic at least not at the present time James believes that IT will become strategic someday in the deregulated market James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the IT arena He mentioned pulling in his IT folks and saying Lets switch the distribution network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances well switch back to AC While James comments may have been controversial with the more than attendees and approximately energy CIOs in the audienc e he does have a point The vertically integrated utilitys core strength is to generate power and distribute it to captive customers reliably While some IT systems like outage management and SCADA devices may be strategic in this sense the other parts of IT are questionable and could be candidates for outsourcing James claims to be working on BB and BC initiatives at the moment His vision for BC is a smart chip in the residence that has access to instantaneous pricing information The residence will buy electricity for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce load thereby reducing the TD utility to a simple conduit for service James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior to its sale to AES In Tucson Electric invested million in NEV and Charles Bayless then Tucson Electrics chairman president and chief executive officer and James Pignatelli Tucson Electrics senior vice president and chief operating officer served on New Energy Ventures administrative committee It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated IT systems If one were to stop and think about it deregulation could not occur without the complex IT systems that are employed today in the marketplace I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have thought about an unbundled electric marketplace It is in fact undoing their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational efficiency DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD See SCIENTECHs

Energy Issues By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD After a tumultuous Election Day full of constant changes in the projections the identity of the next president of the United States was still unknown as of Wednesday morning Nov The identity of the next US president will be determined by a vote recount in Florida which must be completed by the close of business Thursday state election officials said Tuesdays national vote count is so close as is the number of electoral votes won by GOP candidate George W Bush and Democrat Vice President Al Gore that the presidential election is too close to call It is also possible that one candidate could win the Electoral College vote and the other win the popular vote which hasnt happened in a hundred years ANALYSIS Well it certainly has been a historymaking Election Day I was prepared to analyze the future of the energy industry based on which presidential candidate had been elected yesterday As the candidates have such polarized platforms with regard to energy issues it is not an overestimation to say that many critical energy issues hinge on this election As we await the final and accurate announcement of who is the next US president which may not come for another day or so it is a good time to review how each candidate intends to address low domestic supplies of oil and natural gas the status of deregulation the development of renewable energy and the high cost of energy due to recent price spikes Throughout the campaign Bush criticized the ClintonGore Administration for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Rather than developing an effective energy policy Bush accused Gore of raising gasoline taxes discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas and failing to anticipate the oil and naturalgas price spikes that have occurred this year Bush also was very critical of President Clintons decision to tap into the Strategic Reserve Fund in September and release million barrels of crude oil from the nations emergency oil stockpile As the United States now enters a socalled energy crisis brought about primarily as a result of rising demand and diminishing supplies Bush has outlined an energy policy that includes more than initiatives I cant address all of them but have identified the key policies that will likely unfold under a Bush administration Perhaps the best summary of Bushs energy policy is that he supports a comprehensive approach to ensuring US energy security and intends to accomplish this by expanding domestic resources using a range of fuels and technologies supporting ongoing deregulation of the industry and providing energy assistance to lowincome households Reduce American dependence on foreign supplies of oil Bush repeatedly made the case that since US energy demand has more than doubled far outstripping domestic production Today the United States consumes approximately onethird of the worlds energy and approximately percent of our usage comes from foreign sources Bush contends that US dependence on foreign oil has increased from percent in to percent today and that oil imports are projected to increase to million barrels per day by To remedy this Bush supports the development of domestic sources for oil natural gas and renewable energy Specifically Bush has proposed opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to environmentally responsible and regulated exploration with the intent of replacing the oil that the United States now imports from Iraq Regarding natural gas Bush will examine whether certain promising naturalgas reserves in federal lands should be opened for exploration Yet its important to note that Bush is not suggesting that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will be sufficient Rather he recognizes that access to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States and the global economy However instead of relying predominantly on Iraq especially as Saddam Hussein threatens to reduce productionBush will work more clo sely with Canada and Mexico to increase crossborder flows of oil natural gas and electricity within North America Support new pipeline construction As domestic production of oil and natura l gas increases to meet growing demand Bush also supports the construction of new pipelines and would expand refining capacity by tearing down regulatory hurdles Bush has referenced the National Petroleum Councils estimates that the gas industry will require miles of new transmission pipelin es and miles of distribution lines by Bush sees a need for new pipelines and distribution lines in the Midwest in particular where traditional coal plants should ultimately be replaced by gasfired plants Support the growth of renewable energy Bush supports the development of renewable and lowemission fuels and has committed to investing billion over years to fund cleancoal technologies and billion over years to help utilities purchase nuclear plants At the same time Bush will propose legislation requiring utilities to reduce harmful emissions from their generation plants and offer tax credits for power produced from alternative or renewable fuels However Bush recognizes that while renewable energy is important it currently accounts for less than percen t of the total US energy consumption Consequently for the foreseeable future Bush contends that hydrocarbonsoil coal and natural gaswil l continue to play the primary role in meeting the growing energy needs of Americans Support electric deregulation Bush supports deregulation of the energy industry and prefers to let markets and not government officialsdeter mine investment decisions and give customers a choice of suppliers Toward this end Bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed to assure the reliability of the nations electrical grid and to promote consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition While he supports consumer choice Bush recognizes that often lowincome families face high electricity prices as was found in San Diego this summer Consequently Bush supports the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP the largest direct expenditure energy subsidy program which has about million left in funding to support emergency funding for cooling and heatin g assistance In addition Bush will expand the Weatherization Assistance Program which supports about homes by spending billion for Weatherization programs over the next ten years As noted the presidential candidates are proposing very different platform s with regard to the energy industry Thus it is not surprising that Vice President Gore disagrees with most everything that Governor Bush is proposi ng Essentially the most striking difference comes down to conservation While Bush supports the exploration of domestic fuels Gore believes the United States should focus on doing more with what we already have and protecting the environment for future generations Of course Gore carries the legacy of his ClintonGore administration one that as noted has been criticized by Bush for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Thus it is not completely clear how Gore would depart from what has been his administrations approach to energy issues over the last seven years It is likely that Gores administration would follow much the same path that the Clinton administration traveled although Gore certainly has made the environment one of his core platforms for example his book Earth in the Balance Thus is not surprising that creating a clean environment and stable climate is one of the key foundations on which Gore has established his energy platform Beyond that Gore has said that his new energy policy will focus on five goals Saving energy reducing pollution promoting a higher standard of living and creating highwage jobs Reducing the nations dependence on unreliable imported oil Protecting children against the threat of pollution nationally and globally Dramatically reducing the threat posed by global warming Curtailing brownouts by increasing the reliability of the power grid Perhaps the central initiative that Gore has proposed is the creation of the National Energy Security and Environmental Trust Fund Designed to bring revolutionary change to our transportation and energy infrastructure the Fund would help consumers purchase energyefficient vehicles homes and appliances promote clean and reliable sources of electric power and encourage longterm solutions to reduce US dependence on imported sources of oil Gore would provide consumers with a tax credit up to to purchase energyefficient new homes or up to a credit to upgrade the efficiency of their current homes Gore also supports expanding the current percent tax credit provided to homes or businesses that use solar energy to generate electricity or heat water Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the Unite d States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell save a million barrels of oil a day which is exactl y what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to deve lop fuel cells alternative energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve Gore supports tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund as Preside nt Clinton did in September to increase oil supplies prevent winter shortage s of home heating oil and stabilize oil prices Perhaps the only issue on which the two candidates agree is deregulation of the energy industry as a whole This process is of course occurring on a statebystate basis although many states have begun to resist competition due to current low prices in their states and fear of sudden price spikes as occurred in California this summer Bush clearly supports a national restructuring law while it unclear if Gore supports this as well or prefe rs to let states continue to deregulate on their own or opt out from this process One thing is clear in all of this uncertainty The future of the energy industry hangs in the balance and will continue in one of two drastically different directions as the final outcome of this election is determined As supply and demand issues continue to generate concern across the country it is certain that energy issues will remain on the radar of whichever candidate is elected president DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Standard Poors SP revised the outlook to negative from stable on the Midwest Independent Transmission System Midwest ISO SP also confirm ed its triple Bplus issues credit on the Midwest ISO the nonprofit independent corporation that will manage the operations of a portion of the transmissio n assets of utilities across a state region ANALYSIS This is the latest in a string of developments that has put into question the future of the Midwest ISO as the organization continues to sort through the recent announcements of two key members that have decided to depart The Midwest ISO was organized to ensure that energy suppliers are protected against price instability and discriminatory access to the transmission grid among other potential problems associated with grid management For those unaware of the terminology let me offer a brief explanation Under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERCs Order utiliti es that own control or operate transmission assets were essentially mandated to join a regional transmission organization RTO an umbrella term that can include a notforprofit ISO independent system operator forprofit transmission company transco or a hybrid of both models Although roundly considered the favorite ISO model by FERC the foundation of the Midwest ISO began to shake a bit when two founding members announced they were departing to join a competing RTO Commonwealth Edison ComEd announced just last week that it would be leaving the organization and joining the rival Alliance RTO a move it expects to complete by Dec ComEds announcement followed a similar decision last September by Illinois Power also a founding member to depart and join the Alliance RTO The Midwest ISO is a notforprofit model while the Alliance is a transco model Although both utilities cited unique reasons for their departure their move to the Alliance RTO does support a clear preference for the transco model of transmission management over the ISO model ComEd contends that since the completion of its merger with PECO Energyforming the new comp any Exelonit has a significant amount of transmission assets in the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland PJM region and the Alliance RTO offers a better fit for the combined PECO Unicom transmission assets Specifically ComEd argued that the bulk of its customers and suppliers are in the eastern half of the United States where the Alliance RTO is more prominent The Midwest ISO on the other hand has established its presence to the north and west of ComEds service territory From a legal standpoint ComEd claim s that it can break its ties with the Midwest ISO because under a charter agreement it is allowed to depart since its transmission facilities change d ownership through the merger Thinking it might be able to avoid litigation ComEd has promised to meet any financial obligations to the Midwest ISO before it officially departs for the Alliance RTO Illinois Power one of the original nine participants in the Midwest ISO dating back to January was the first utility to make its exit from the Midwest ISO Illinois Power like ComEd claimed that its acquisition by Dynegy constituted a change in ownership freeing itself from the ISO agreement and that a move to the Alliance RTO would be more appropriate However as Ive inferred I believe both utilities have made their attempt ed moves because of a desire to operate under a forprofit transco model The impetus for both of their departures probably had less to do with their respective mergers and more to do with the fact that previous talks to form a transco operating separately under the Midwest ISO fizzled last summer Perhaps concluding that the ISO model would be restrictive Illinoi s Power has stated that its reasons for the changeinheart came about becaus e of greater flexibility and cost savings that would be realized by being a member of the Alliance RTO These benefits would originate from the RTOs experience in deregulated markets many members of the Alliance RTO operate in deregulated states as opposed to the members of the Midwest ISO The Alliance RTO also eliminates pancaked rates and provides price certainty through its postage stamp rate for transactions providing power outside of or through the Alliance and its license plate rate for all transacti ons that deliver power within the Alliance Although ComEd and Illinois Power have announced their departures its important to note that the Midwest ISO is not going to let them leave witho ut a fight Realizing that losing the transmission assets of both utilities severely diminishes the bulk of its organization the Midwest ISO has submitted a motion with FERC to block the utilities exit ComEd for instance contributes about percent of the load that was originally scheduled to flow through the Midwest ISO Thus the Midwest ISO is arguing that creating a broad RTO based on widely dispersed transmission assets is in the best interest of all of its members In addition the Midwest ISO contends that allowing utilities to easily switch from one RTO to another would compromise reliability across interconnected transmission grids Ironically the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power along with the FERC investigation of the case comes at a time when the Midwest ISO appeared to be growing Just last month Kansas Citybased UtiliCorp and Fergus Falls Minnbased Otter Tail Power Co announced that they were joining the Midwest ISO The addition of UtiliCorp was a major coup for the Midwest ISO as the energy company owns about miles of electric transmission lines Wisconsin Public Service Resources and American Transmission recentl y joined as transmissionowning members and Calpine Corp joined as a nontransmission member In addition the Midwest ISO just announced that it is assuming management responsibility for the operating functions of the MidAmerican Interconnected Network MAIN which provides electricity to about milli on people within key Midwest states overseen by the Midwest ISO The partnersh ip of the two organizations should help to facilitate a smooth transition for the Midwest ISO to become operational on its target date next December In any event it is clear that the SP downgrading of the Midwest ISO is a direct reaction to the likely departure of ComEd and Illinois Power something that FERC may not be able to prevent Specifically SP is acknowledging that the departure of ComEd and Illinois Power will result in a material loss of some load subject to the Midwest ISO cost adder What this means is that the Midwest ISOs debt repayment obligations are based on a cost adder that is applied to certain transmission loads The cost adder is capped at centsMWh during the transition period from the start of operations fourth quarter until the fourthquarter of As noted ComEd contributes about percent of the load that is scheduled to flow through the Midwest ISO If ComEd and Illinois Power actually do leave the Midwest ISO this could result in a higher cost adder being placed on remaining members While the Midwest ISOs costs are fully recoverable under its tariff with remaining members raising its cost adder could have a negative impact on the lowcost economic incentives that the Midwest ISO has used to attract new members Moreover the future prospects for the Midwest ISO remain questionable If ComEd and Illinois Power are allowed to leave it could spark a mass exodus of other members which obviously would shrink the organization and cast in doubt its status among other RTOs Moving forward during this period of upheaval the central challenge for the Midwest ISO is to identif y the benefits of joining its notforprofit model when so many utilities clearly prefer the forprofit transco model DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you

more about SCIENTECHs Mergers Acquisitions and Convergence in the US Electric Industry InfoGrid at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM announced yesterday that it intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka Kansas based Western Resources WR in a taxfree stockforstock transaction The deal will require that WR separate its nonutility assets from its regulated utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders ANALYSIS In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry strategic combinations are becoming more commonplace This announcement took me by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of merger WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp United by attempting to acquire KCPL in At the time WR share price was above In WR share price soared to record highs of more than WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed They sold their interest in ADT for a million profit This profit masked a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the time was cutting WR rates by million reducing earnings by cents per share WR who obviously had a strategic focus on security used the profits from the ADT sale to purchase percent of Protection One one of the fastest growing companies in the monitored security business Protection One hit some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result their stock tumbled WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be favorable to them As a result some moved their money out of WR and by WR share price had tumbled to to In January of this year KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off the merger WR immediately split itself into two organizations regulated utility operations and nonregulated business with the intent of finding a buyer for the regulated utility operations WR claimed in June of this year that companies were being courted including international companies for the utility operations assets of Kansas Power Light KPL and Kansas Gas and Electric KGE Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me But it does fit SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba CEO of PNM just weeks ago and asked if the development of alliances mergers and acquisitions were a part of the positive approach to PNMs strategy Jeff answered Very definitely Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business and that can bring a sustainable competitive advantage are essential for us in this industry The criticality of market channels cant be overemphasized Once you have a good market channel that doesnt mean that everything you put through that market channel you have to do yourself or you have to own You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances There are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves something that is core to your business So both alliances and acquisitions will be a part of PNMs future Just weeks later PNM is buying WR Utilizing my rear view mirror now I see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM They both operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix including nuclear They both have multicommodity in electric and gas They both have wholesale operations PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part to a strong wholesale operation PNM net earnings for the nine months ended Sept totaled million or per share diluted on total operating revenues of billion compared to earnings of million or per share in the first three quarters of PNM has adopted a niche strategy in the wholesale power market by developing tailored wholesale power products for its customers While some of the megatraders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard commodity PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according to the needs of the buyer PNM has found success in this niche segment of a large wholesale market The merger deal is expected to take between and months to complete PNM will inherit approximately billion in debt making the total value of the deal worth billion Fitch has placed its securities ratings of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving Fitch plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact of the merger Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist between Wichita and Topeka This may result in a rate case It should also be noted that Wichita Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover municipalize the electric system from Western Resources within its city limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka Wichita has about power customers roughly a fourth of all the customers served by Western Resources They represent more than million of KGEs million in revenues PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has demonstrated its ability to do so PNM has decreased its debttocapital ratio from percent to less than percent in the last seven years The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque NM and the chairman president and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba Search SCIENTECHs PowerHitter archive to read about our

ecommerce has revolutionized commodity trading the AD process and procurement within the energy industry With heavyweight keynotes and indepth panel discussions this is the first event to bring the major energy companies net markets venture capitalists regulatory bodies investment banks and analysts together to thrash out why its not business as usual but business online For more information please visit wwweyeforenergycomxonline SCIENTECH IssueAlert November The New Power Company Going Green While Stock Price Drops By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The New Power Company TNPC NYSE NPW which bills itself as the first national residential and small business energy provider announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy Inc to provide windgenerated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area Under the terms of the agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of ANALYSIS This is an interesting development especially considering that TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from PECO Energy This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain On the other hand it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company founded earlier this year by Enron along with partners AOL and IBM As you may recall just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply competitive default service for approximately of PECOs residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement arguing that the PECOTNPC agreement is not in the public interest and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question Thus it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services Up to this point TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers such as the approximately natural gas and electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group The acquisition of the customers in PECOs territory was a major coup for TNPC which is still in startup mode Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy Community Energy the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatthours allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power Interestingly the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about MW of green power to aggregated state agencies This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio Thus while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPCs original business plan the company appears to be moving in this direction at least in states where it is strategic to do so However this announcement comes on the heels of TNPCs announcement of its thirdquarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price TNPCs revenues for Q were million derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states Pennsylvania and New Jersey Gross profit was million or percent of revenues Yet the loss on earnings before income tax EBIT was million The net loss for the quarter was million or per basic share TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history Therefore the company contends that its yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance The companys goal for Q is to achieve revenues of approximately to million with an estimated yearend customer count of Eugene Lockhart TNPCs CEO said he was pleased with the Q performance Lockhart contends that TNPC achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives and referenced the fact that the company is still building its systems and architecture so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets In addition TNPC has raised approximately million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation However despite its positive outlook after TNPC made its earnings announcement its shares took a nosedive perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy providers ability to meet its objectives The shares closed last Friday at which is a dramatic drop from the average price of before the Q earnings announcement TNPC issued its IPO on Oct at a price of per share which at the time seemed quite high for a startup energy company with a limited track record A day after its opening the stock closed at per share The stock was received so favorably for two reasons in my estimation First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners among others put up about million in startup capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner of TNPC with percent control Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over customers Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock and the company is at a crossroads In order to keep its momentum on track TNPC needs to do two things First it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states Second as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors Consequently it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven Regarding the customer base expansion Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target Just last week the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state Yet its clear that TNPC is still finetuning its marketing approach In Ohio it is offering customers competitive energy prices flexible payment and pricing choices and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive but there is no mention in TNPCs application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio Moreover several questions remain Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC Will TNPC demonstrate revenues of million in Q And where will the companys next acquisition of customers take place All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC Miss last week Catch up on

article Bright Lights A Conversation With Kevin Jordan President of Excel Energy Technologies Ltd at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml SCIENTECH IssueAlert November SmartEnergy Rounds Up million in Financing Is an IPO in the Works By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities venture capital and global banks SmartEnergy a privately held Internetbased energy service provider active in New York plans to use the funding as working capital to rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment schedule ANALYSIS You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago IssueAlert Oct when I drew attention to the fact that the online startup was taking customers away from ConEdison In existence only since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers Under a promotion currently under way in New York SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to percent on energy through the winter months for naturalgas customers in the boroughs of New York City and Westchester County Capitalizing on ongoing threats about low supplies of oil and natural gas SmartEnergy is using the socalled energy crisis to lure customers away from the traditional utility by locking in current naturalgas rates over the course of the next months under its Smart Fixed Rate plan As a policy SmartEnergy hedges the products that its sell to customers so that neither the company nor its customers is exposed to energy market price risks In addition SmartEnergy has offered United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement to secure customers As I discussed last month an advantage that online energy providers such as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers In addition operating online allows SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets Up until now SmartEnergys marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York state However the company claims that it will be serving six states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the end of this year SmartEnergy expects to be serving all deregulated states by the end of and the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support this anticipated growth Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns as the energy industry continues to become deregulated Investors that are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy WPS Resources Corporation Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors In addition there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round including Dexia Ventures the private equity arm of Dexia Bank a USD billion asset bank based in Belgium KBC Bank and venture capitalist groups Trust Capital Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures The inclusion of both American and European investors is important Coupled with SmartEnergys intention to operate in all US states that are deregulating the fact that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic The fact that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform of worldwide service In fact Alliant Energy identified the strong growth of the Internet and technology in the energy segment as a key reason why it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy In fact the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison Wisbased Alliant has been in existence for several months The utilitys nonregulated subsidiary Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy to expand a decidedly efocused business The partnership with SmartEnergy represents Alliants new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies offering stateoftheart technology and new products and services for customers In fact Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as the energy company of today and tomorrow and believes that it has a platform that can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world Of course my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy It would certainly be an obvious move for the private company to head in this direction especially now as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street Ive written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like Evergreen Solar Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid IPOs as a result of in my opinion their business models in new technologies and or alternative fuels There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years With few exceptions energy companies exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several months have performed comparatively well As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid startup companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer service again resulting from its online presence Customer interaction can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet enabling account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at any time The downside of course is customer reluctance to sign up with a startup company that they may not know In addition SmartEnergy faces tough competition from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in deregulated markets including Utilitycom and Essentialcom None of these companies has yet gone public and are instead focusing on building critical mass and establishing their brand identities Yet of the three SmartEnergy may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion and could be on the fast track to an IPO in the near term SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts and consultants will get results Learn more about our

<33344198.1075842469053.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-11-16 03:02:00,Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal Learn about SCIENTECHS most popular competitive tools including the Mergers and Acquisitions Telecommunications and ECommerce InfoGrids at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to be built according to a new report from Financial Times Energy The additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through but also includes Finland France Germany Sweden and the United Kingdom At the same time concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being exacerbated by Germanys plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power ANALYSIS If FT Energys projections for necessary generation additions in Europe are accurate I think there are some real challenges that the Continent will face in reaching this goal First off for perspective lets be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming Europe will need by The figure of MW is roughly equivalent to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system in Texas When we consider also that the United States consumes about double the amount of power that Europe consumes the projection that Europe will need an additional MW of new generating capacity is a staggering proposition Granted like other developed areas of the world Europes energy consumption has grown over the last two years According to data included in its report FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from terrawatthours TWh in to TWh in an increase of about percent per year While this may seem like a minimal increase it is important to note that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average For instance estimated new capacity additions through are mainly concentrated in Spain France Germany and Sweden The growth in demand coupled with market liberalization has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction or purchase of generation assets Although reportedly percent of the electricity market across Europe has been liberalized to date the Continent remains rather disjointed as it is composed of national markets that are all approaching privatization at different speeds The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their privatization movements in the early s Spain required its stateowned utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February a process that will continue through Germany decided to open percent of its market all at once in April And France resisted efforts to privatize and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European Union Consequently although Europe may in fact need the MW of new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected the type and extent to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on the energy policy of each independent nation A variety of restrictions may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount of capacity Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization and by extension its approach to generation development I cant examine the policy of each country in this forum but I think a look at Germany is warranted both because it is a major component of Europes total energy market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact the Continent as a whole Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened to competition It follows that generation coming from Germany should contribute a large percentage of the Continents future power needs However a large percentage of Germanys power has come from nuclear power but that has all changed over the last year After the Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party nuclear energy became an unacceptable energy source The German government has essentially put a moratorium on nuclear power and in fact decided to eventually shut down nuclear power plants in the country Just last month Germanys two largest power producers RWE AG and EON AG announced plans to cut output from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has developed since Germany liberalized its market The measures amount to a reduction of about percent in Germanys overall power generating capacity Moreover nuclear energy has generated over onethird of Germanys nearly billion kilowatthours of annual electricity demand and onethird of Western Europes total electricity supply As the future of nuclear power in Germany looks rather dim big questions surround what will replace nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europes energy industry Coal currently produces about percent of the power generation in Germany but as a result of the countrys attempts to lower emissions coal also appears to be on a decline Also in Germany as in the rest of Europe coalindustry subsidies will come to an end as early as making it less economical to invest in coalfired plants At the same time other countries like France are exploring cleancoal technologies but it is questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand across the Continent Generally natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will take the place of nuclear power in Europe given the seemingly abundant supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea However as demand across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases this may impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe In addition there are no effective rules across Europe for thirdparty access to private pipeline grids also putting into question the future of naturalgas supplies Also as we have seen in the United States as demand for natural gas increases so will the prices which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary power source As a result much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable energy In fact the German government wants to double renewable energy output to percent of total energy demand by using such forms as hydroelectric and wind power This seems consistent with what the rest of Europe is doing The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate percent of its electricity from renewable resources by Scandinavian countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and lowemission forms of energy with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of the Nordic regions total electricity production Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western Europe with projects in Germany Denmark and Spain ranking among the fastestgrowing in the world Again according to the US DOE wind power is projected to grow by percent per year in Western Europe This growth prospective is pretty dismal and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe Renewable energy works fine when planning overall energy needs but it rarely can be relied on to meet peak demand The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to and the sun shines when it wants to which can make peak planning based on renewable energy difficult if not impossible This being the case many critics say Europes current move toward renewable energy is completely unrealistic arguing that it would take nearly wind turbines to equal one nuclear plant In addition the growth for renewable energy is plotted over the course of ten to fifteen years FT Energy marks the year as the point at which Europe will need the additional MW of generating capacity In addition despite the fact that coalfired generation poses pollution problems it is still a comparatively lowcost form of generation This will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence of a strong worldwide commitment The US Department of Energy projects only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy through just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain a slim percent share of the total world energy consumption So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs First keep in mind that Ive focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role in Europe as a whole However the restrictions on nuclear power are not necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries For instance the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by opening a plant in Temelin The question is without Germanys contribution of nuclear power will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other power sources and other countries Although the MW goal seems very ambitious Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use of merchant plants As competition continues wholesale power buyers are demanding shorterterm contracts which in turn is supporting a growing trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent Presently only the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power but there are signs that the trend is extending to Italy Spain the Netherlands and even Germany In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear power merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europes naturalgas market Yet as we have seen in California the plant siting process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles and it is not clear if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries Plus the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily naturalgas fired which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source Moreover just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter due to our own brand of energy supply problems we are finding that the problem is not limited to our part of the world It is of course unknown if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of MW by Yet at the same time it is clear that demand on the Continent continues to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at webrciwebnsfwebDeptsIAhtml SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we

utilities information in our new ezine SourceBook Weekly which will be launched on December Get a free SourceBook Weekly article at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Corp Pursues Multiple Generation Projections Looks Outside of California for Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD PGE Corp NYSE PCG announced that it will acquire a MW wind power generating station near Palm Springs Calif to supply electricity to the Western power grid PGE subsidiary National Energy Group is purchasing the plant from Seawest Wind Power Inc a San Diegobased developer of wind energy plants PGE expects the plant to enter commercial operation in the spring of ANALYSIS This is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom for PGE Corp Just over the last two months PGE Corp also has announced several other generation projects both within California and in other strategic areas of the country National Energy Group NEGPGE Corps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New Englandis spearheading all of the new generation projects PGE Corp claims that its goal is for NEG to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by Thus the accelerate d increase of megawatts under the NEG banner certainly is working toward that goal Lets take a quick look at the other generation projects that PGE Corp has announced in addition to the Palm Springs wind power facility Just last week NEG announced a longterm tolling agreement with Southaven Power an affiliate of Cogentrix Energy Under terms of the agreement NEGs subsidiary PGE Energy Trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced at an MW naturalgas fueled combined cycle located in Mississippi just south of the Tennessee border near Memphis The deal is noteworthy because it positions NEG close to the existing TVA and Entergy electric substations that will deliver the plants electricity into the regions transmission grid This announcement followed other substantial projects in Southern Californi a and Oregon The MW Otay Mesa Generating Project located in San Diego County is in the final stages of plant siting The project represents the first new power plant built in San Diego County in almost three decades and of course will become operational during a time when low supplies in California continue to drive up prices In Oregon NEG has just submitte d an application to build a new plant in Hermiston Ore adjacent to an alreadyexisting MW plant that NEG coowns with PacifiCorp The propose d Umatilla Generating Project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine that will burn natural gas with its fuel supply transported via the NEGs Pacific Northwest naturalgas pipeline The growth of NEG is a real success for PGE Corp at a time when its regulated subsidiary is struggling PGE Company the utility that provides natural gas and electric service to approximately million people in Northern and Central California has accumulated about billion in debt PGE Co buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal e market but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the company has little control over the rates it can charge customers Thus over the course of last summer PGE Co was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour PGE remains embroiled in negotiations with the CPUC over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt While the regulated PGE Co could find itself wallowing in the red dependi ng on regulatory rulings NEG has soared In the Q of PGE Corp report ed second quarter earnings from operations of per share on a diluted basis or million which represented a percent over diluted earning s from operations in the same quarter in Much of this success can be attributed to NEG which reported Q earnings of million which reflect ed a percent profit increase from the previous years quarter The winning streak continued into Q in which PGE Corp reported diluted earnings from operations at per share or million and revenues of billion compared with third quarter revenues of billion This constituted a percent increase in profit for the parent company Again NEG performed very well NEG contributions rose with diluted earnings from operations of per share or million on revenues of billi on Clearly PGE Corp has benefited greatly from NEGs ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside of the regulated California market Thus it is no wonder that although PGE Corp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated In addition the plant siting process in California historically has been quite restrictive and lengthy which also may explain why PGE Corp has chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state The siting process in California shows signs of becoming more facile In fact just yesterday the California Energy Commission adopted emergency regulations to implement the states new sixmonth power plant licensing process The new regulations allow for environmentally advanced power plantssuch as PGEs wind power plant in Palm Springsto be licensed and come online more quickly in California Currently PGE Corp has ownership and arrangement interests in more than plants the bulk of which are managed by NEG The companys generation portfolio currently consists of MW and more than MW in new power plant development and construction is in production As PGE Corp continues to expand its generation base it probably realizes that current industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least MW in order to be a formidable player By comparison a company like AEP clearly one the top generation companies in the industryhas a worldwide generat ing capacity of MW As NEG is PGEs primary growth vehicle at the prese nt time I think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced by this subsidiary Some questions remain Will PGE Corp split its unregulated and regulated operations into two standalone companies as other utilities such as AEP and Reliant have recently announced I checked with my sources at PGE Corp and the official company position is that there are no plans to restructure in this way at this time However PGE Corp does acknowledge the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for its regulated companys debt while showing a percent profit increase from its unregulated business Also what are the prospects for PGE Corps hydroelectric system Accordi ng to prior agreements PGE Corp was supposed to sell its MW hydroelectric system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in Septem ber However just last August PGE Corp petitioned the CPUC to halt this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold from the regulated PGE Co to an asofyetunformed unregulated subsidiary for billion PGE Corps motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou s the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale of hydropower at market prices In addition according to a Sept report from Dow Jones Newswires assuming a book value of about million for the hydroelectric system PGE Corp could take the remaining billion to pay off the transition debts incurred by PGE Co The CPUC and PGE Corp continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system and whether or not PGE Corp should be allowed to sell the assets to an unregulated company While this debate rages on NEG is free to continue along its aggressive growth mode DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Duke Williams to Buy Gulfstream from Coastal Corporation By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly purchase The Coastal Corporations percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project The purchase expected to be finalized by the end of this year is subject to federal regulatory approvals and conditione d upon completion of the Coastal El Paso Energy Corporation merger Financi al terms of the purchase were not disclosed ANALYSIS The Gulfstream project is a proposed mile steel pipeline designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida The project has been sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp a billion Houstonbased energy holding company with operations in naturalgas production distribut ion and marketing Coastal Corp is presently waiting for FERCs approval to build and operate the system However due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Corps pending merger with El Paso Energy Corp Coastal Corp was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project As a result Duke Energy and Williams have found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida market Until the merger is complete Coastal Corp will continue to develo p and market Gulfstream According to Coastal the billion Gulfstream project has already achie ved two important milestones in its FERC approval process preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues and a favorable draft environmental impact statement The company anticipates that the project will receive full FERC approval in the first quarter and that Gulfstream will become fully operational in June Approximately miles of the route which originates in Mobile Ala crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters Gulfstream offers billion cubic feet of naturalgas capacity per day and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and powergeneration facilities that plan on using highefficiency natural gas turbines Already the project has precedent agreements with large Flori da utilities and power generation facilities Upon completion of the purchase Duke and Williams will proceed with the jointly managed operation and development of the Gulfstream project Its not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be interested in making the acquisition The two companies which have historically had a collaborative relationship already own significant amounts of interstate naturalgas pipeline capacity Between its two subsidiaries involved in naturalgas productionDuke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission Duke Energy owns and operates about miles of pipeline and intersta te miles of capacity Williams five interstate natural gas pipelines reported ly deliver about percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States The companys vast mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada serving more than million residential commercial and industrial natural gas users In fact the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida a mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstrea m project will follow Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer project now that they are acquiring the Gulfstream project The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Florida The CEO of Williams gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market would support only one new pipeline coming into the state By joining together Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the highgrowth state as it eventually becomes competitive First among the priorities for the project is to ensur e adequate pipeline capacity by June and meeting the projected MW electric generation growth that is expected by Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project accelerates its own entry into Florida In fact Richard Priory Dukes CEO conceded at a conference last September that much of Dukes future success will result from its naturalgas operations Specifically Duke has been focused on merchant plant and naturalgas pipeline construction for some time As of this summer Duke was rated third in announced merchan t plants behind Calpine and Panda and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants and acquiring naturalgas pipelines Thus the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make And the strategy is resulting in some significant payoffs for the company Dukes thirdquarter earnings rose percent Duke attributed the higher results to the continued expansion of its unregulated energy businesses specifically naturalgas gathering and foreign energy sales Dukes shares which had been trading at week peaks are currently trading at as of the opening of the market on Nov Current market conditions certainly validate Dukes growth in this direction For starters current data indicate that natural gas is the fuel of choice for approximately percent of all new electric generation that is being built Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from trillion to trill ion cubic feet per year by In addition coal and nuclear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades at a time when naturalgas prices were comparatively low All of these factors have created a strong market for naturalgas generation despite the fact that data from the Department of Energy suggests a shortage of natural gas and heating oil for this winter Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market so this purchase could facilitate easier expansion in the state About a year ago the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach However the states three IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court arguing that merch ant plants were not allowed under state law The Florida Supreme Court overturn ed the decision of the state PSC blocking Dukes entry into the state Consequently Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another way to get into the Florida market and one that is potentially more profitable Florida has not yet passed restructuring legislation and it is unclear when the state will become competitive Bills have been introduced into the state legislature but thorny issues such as stranded cost recovery and unbundling charges have caused the bills to be removed Presently Governor Jeb Bush has created a member commission to develop an energy plan for the state The commission must submit a report to the governor and the legislature by December Among the issues that must be addressed are power reliability energy supply and delivery and the fiscal impacts of deregulation However it is clear from the commissions deadlin e that competition will not take effect in Florida during Yet looking forward if the California experience is any indication the naturalgas shortage should work to Dukes advantage As wholesale prices skyrocketed this summer Duke and other generators were in a prime position to reap large gains Duke is still following this tactic on the West Coast California regulators just gave approval to the construction of a proposed MW unit in Monterey County which again is naturalgas fired combine d cycle unit If California history repeats itself in Florida Duke and Willi ams will be the coowners of the only new gas pipeline coming into the state at a time when naturalgas supplies remain quite low DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy NYSE DYN and NRG Energy NYSE NRG announced a major expansion of their coowned generation portfolio in the West through asset purchase agreements to acquire MW of power generation facilities from Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The facilities include the MW gasfired Clark Generating Station and MW of the MW coalfired Reid Gardner Generating Station The facilities are currently owned by Sierra Pacific Resources subsidiary Nevada Power Company and serve the growing Las Vegas market ANALYSIS This million purchase has resulted from regulatory mandates surrounding the Sierra PacificNevada Power merger which was completed in July Sierra Pacific is undergoing the sale and transfer of all of its remaining gas oil and naturalgas fired Nevada generating assets which it intends to complete in The Reid Gardner and Clark Stations are among the seven asset bundles that were included in an auction by Sierra Pacific earlier this year Located in southeastern Las Vegas the Clark Generating Station consists of gas and oilfired generating units which as noted total MW The oldes t unit at the Clark Generating Station became operational in the newest in Specific information about which units at the Clark Generating Station are included in this purchase was not available The Reid Gardner Generating Station consists of four baseload coalfired units and is locate d miles northeast of Las Vegas According to recent data from the Energy Information Administration the California Department of Water Resources owns about percent of the Reid Gardner Plant It is not clear what impac t the Dynegy NRG purchase will have on this organizations ownership in the plant The purchase of the Sierra Pacific assets is subject to approval from the Federal Trade Commission FERC and the Nevada Public Utilities Commission and is expected to close during the second quarter of Additional conditions of the deal include a power purchase agreement for Nevada Power to buy energy and ancillary services from Dynegy and NRG at a stable price until March On their own both companies are leaders in independent power production and energy supply Yet this acquisition is the latest in a string of collaborative efforts between Dynegy and NRG Together the companies have been actively acquiring power plants in Illinois and the West Coast along with purchases that they have made independently In fact this purchase of assets from Sierra Pacific marks the sixth asset alliance between Dynegy and NRG Together the two companies jointly own MW of power generation facilities in California and MW in Illinois In most of the partnerships and in the case of this latest purchase from Sierra Pacific Dynegy markets the energy produced at the plants and oversees fuel management services while NRG manages the operational side Last July Dynegy and NRG entered into a similar agreement to expand the Rocky Road Power Plant a natural gasfired simple cycle peaking facility in East Dundee Illinois The move into Illinois was an important strategy for both companies Of course Dynegy completed its merger with Illinova last summer creating a billion company that is wellpositioned to compete in electric generation wholesale and retail marketing and gas and electric power trading At the time the CEO of NRG Energy made it clear that the Rocky Road plant expansion was part of the two companies strategy in becoming a large contributor to the Chicagoarea energy market Dynegy in fact intends to continue acquiring and expanding generation facilities in Illinois so that it can compete with Exelon Corp Moreover both companies are positioning themselves to be leaders in generation capacity and power supply and the purchase of the MW from Sierra Pacific factors in to both of their strategies Not only does the acquisiti on help to expand both companies asset base but it also diversifies their power supply offerings For instance NRG claims that the assets complement its current gasfired peaking and intermediate California assets providing the benefits of fuel and dispatch level diversification NRG aims to build a top three position in its primary markets The acquisition of assets from Sierra Pacific puts NRG into a prime position in the fastgrowing Nevada and Western markets by adding a strong component of baseload generat ion to its portfolio In fact this is the second acquisition that NRG has made from Sierra Pacif ic Just last month NRG announced its intent to purchase a percent interest in the Valmy Power Station which Sierra Pacific is selling also as a resul t of regulatory mandates The Valmy Power Station which is primarily coalfired produces electricity in the northern Nevada and surrounding markets In this million deal NRG acted as an independent buyer Dynegy has long claimed that it wants to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five year by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others In order to reach this goal I had projected last summer that Dynegy might be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale considering the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies The compan y has now taken a different path to achieve essentially the same result The addition of Sierra Pacifics facilities combined with other assets that the company has acquired or developed this year increases Dynegys generating capacity by more than gross megawatts Dynegy contends that this figure is comparable to many industry mergers without the regulat ed transmission and distribution businesses Dynegy also believes the acquisit ion will support a raise in its earnings forecast for from to per share Dynegys goals are pretty ambitious However the company has been increasi ng earnings over the last year so the per share target may be attainabl e For Q Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the compan ys consolidated net income There is little doubt that Dynegy and NRG considering that they own MW of power in the state benefited from the short supplies in California this summer whichalong with other factorsdr ove up the cost for power in the state Another interesting element to this announcement is the fact that similar strategic acquisitions are being made possible by mandated divestiture that other companies have faced due to merger activity Just yesterday I wrote about Duke and Williams embarking on a joint venture to purchase the Gulfstream pipeline project from Coastal Corp This sale was made possi ble because Coastal is being forced to divest the pipeline as a result of its merger with El Paso Energy As the old adage goes one companys loss is another companys gain which could be viewed as one of the drawbacks of MA activity Another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing between companies The Duke Williams and Dynegy NRG projects are both examples of companies that have collaborated on development and acquisition ventures to support both their joint and individual strategies As the energy industry becomes more competitive likeminded companies may find that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by for example Southern Company DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Read SCIENTECHs free SourceBook Weekly article AES SourceBooks

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Endesa NYSE ELE Spains largest power utility has signed an agreement with Charbonnages de France CDF to acquire a percent interest in the French electricity generator Societe Nationale dElectricite et de Thermiqu e SNET The transaction has been authorized by the French Government The agreement includes Endesas right to increase its interest in SNET in the medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies and allow Endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in France and Europe ANALYSIS The approval for Endesa to acquire percent interest in SNET cements the companys move into France which is a major component in the aggressive expansion efforts Endesa has been implementing this year SNET while a comparatively small company by American standards is still the second largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity and third largest in terms of electricity generation SNET owns five coal plants totaling megawatts which generate about GWh annually This is a very low output and in fact SNET accounts for only percent of the market share in France However given the fact that Frances larges t energy company EDF still has a hold on about percent of the market in the country any acquisition of the nextlargest company is a major coup The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the companys experience in coalbased electricitywhich still is the po wer source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent and its progressiveness in terms of technology Presently SNET sells the bulk of its electricity output to EDF under a longterm contract between the two companies The rest of its generation is sold to eligible customers In addition to its current assets SNET is also planning a new MW gasfired station in eastern France and is the front runner to build a new cleancoal plant in the heavily industriali zed Rhone Valley Thus as France slowly opens its market to competition SNET could emerge as one of the major providers Endesa was able to beat out other bidders for SNET including Frances Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and Germanys RWE due to the positive valuation of Endesas industrial and commercial projects and the economic value of its offer Endesa already entered the French market last month with a threeyear exclusive agreement to serve the energy needs of SEB a small appliance company The companys move outside of Spain resulted from several factors First the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of its largest electric companies essentially landlocking the domestic growt h of companies like Endesa and forcing them to look outward for growth opportunities In addition growth in countries like France and Germany is probably appeal ing to Endesa because their central location offers additional expansion opportunities into Italy and Eastern Europe Just within the last year privatization has come to the major European countrieseither all at once as in the case of Germany or in forced increments as occurred in France There has been little question that Endesa would like to develop generation interests across the Continent and has taken advantage of competitive opportunities as they have emerged In fact Endesa disclosed that it plans to become a leading European power player through the swap of assets with other electricity customers and through acquisitions Rumor has it that Endesa is also lookin g to acquire the generation assets of EnelItalys stateowned power and the biggest European rival to EDF However as Endesa expands abroad it continues to face significant problems in Spain due mostly to its proposed merger with the second largest electricity provider in the country Iberdrola Just last month Endesa announced that it had entered into a friendly merger with Iberdrola Together the two companies will gain a hold over percent of Spains power market with a combined market capitalization of the equivalent to billion Reported ly the merger will create the worlds thirdbiggest electricity company after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron However Spanish oil company Repsol which lost out on the bid for Iberdrola to Endesa continues to contemplate renew ing a hostile takeover of the company Repsol claims that it in fact offered more euros per share than what Endesa has promised to pay for Iberdrola in their billion merger but that Iberdrola did not even consider the bid Both Endesa and Repsol are partially owned by the Spanish government only percent of Endesa is publicly traded so presently negotiations are being held to see if a compromise can be reached Reportedly the merge r between Endesa and Iberdrola can occur only if some of the companies belong ing to the merged company are sold as per the Spanish antimonopoly legislation Ironically this could benefit Repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization across the Continent In fact France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the European Union While other European countries have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although Endesa is certainly pushing through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country A report from the Parisbased International Energy Agency issued just last week contends that Frances power liberalization law restricts power trading and allows EDF to keep its market advantages However even though Endesa may face expansion limitations in France it is important to remember how large the company is in its home country Endesa produces about half of Spains electricity MW relying mainly on nuclear and coalfired plants Looking to diversify Endesa also owns interests in gas water and telecommunications companies It is the largest shareholder in Auna a jointly owned company with partners Telecom Italia and Unin Fenosa that controls Retevisin Spains secondlargest phone company behind Telefnica In addition Endesa is also investing heavily in energy firms in Latin America Thus although France is very important for Endesas European expansion efforts the company is still a contender in other key markets DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a sponsorship of IssueAlert by contacting Nancy Spring at or Advertising opportunities are also available on our website DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Co Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Last Wednesday PGE Co proposed a fiveyear rate stabilization plan that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than billio n in power costs incurred last summer Under PGEs plan submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC for approval average residential bills of would increase to about a month as of Jan This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes after an existing rate freeze ends by However a portion of the incre ase also would go to paying down the billion in unforeseen charges that PGE insists are not the utilitys responsibility ANALYSIS Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this past summer focused on San Diego Gas Electric SDGE the legacy of the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PGE and Southern California Edison SCE as both utilities have yet to fully enter competitive markets within the state This latest proposal from PGE is an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently carries Lets first understand how PGE found itself in the red since this is critical to the utilitys argument that customers should be responsible for the debt Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in its service territory PGE must its power on the wholesale market In addition under Californias restructuring mandates PGE had to buy its power out of the Power Exchange PX rather than establishing bilateral contracts with suppliers The combination of low supply and high demand drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer which PGE faced as a buyer Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect PGE has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers Although reports vary on average PGE has been paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market when by law it is only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour As a result of these factors PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting relief from its debt and also its argument thatsince it was obligated to buy the power for customers in the first placeits customers should ultimately carry the burden for the high costs PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off Consequently PGE has been lobbying to the CPUC for several months for various options that would all result in PGE custom ers picking up the billion tab The utility first proposed to retroactivel y bill customers for the debt This latest proposal changes the course a bit to provide for a rate increase but the end result would essentially be the same Under the proposal PGEs rate freeze would end Jan and resident ial and small business customers would begin paying cents per kilowatt hour for five years compared with the current wholesale costs of cents per kilowatt hour generation costs Without such a rate stabilizati on plan in place PGE warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more than after the rate freeze is lifted The utility also contends that the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summers high prices amounts to less than percent of the total monthly increases To reduce the impact on lowincome customers the utility plans to increase their discount to percent from the percent they currently receive PGE said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates proved not to be high enough to cover costs If the deficit of uncollected costs grew by billion for example then rates at the start of would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around percent to cents Skepticsincluding some within the CPUCsay PGE is simply looking to protect its own interests Carl Wood a CPUC commissioner referred to PGEs propo sal as volume two of their bailout request and noted that the request results in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the utilitys debt The consumer group TURN contends that PGE and not custome rs is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred The group also argues that although PGE has cast its proposal under a guise of customer protection the proposal only really serves to assure PGE of full recovery of its debt In addition TURN noted that PGE submitted its proposal to the CPUC on the day before Thanksgiving conceivably to downplay media attention and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC PGE remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal PGE believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers for debt it believes it accrued on its customers behalf PGEs proposal comes at a time when the utilitys reputation has taken a beating A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that the CPUC received more than complaints about PGE from to According to the report PGE received more than three times as many complaints per customer as SDGE during the past three years which is quite significa nt considering that SDGE customers were exposed to bills that increased by two and three times their normal amounts last summer The comparison betwee n PGE and SDGE was made because they are the only major private utilities in the state to offer both electric and gas service PGE also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide From to PGE complaints represented percent of the total filed with the CPUC even though it only has percent of gas customers and percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the state Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PGE concerned billing problems In its own defense PGE claims that it faces a unique set of weatherrelated conditions that make the service it provide s to customers more fraught with problems which consequently results in more complaints It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PGEs request but prior comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility s proposal will be rejected This casts a dark shadow over the future of PGE as without being able to bill customers for its debt it is uncertain how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent Ironically unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PGE Corp continue to perform well and show profits Yet the huge debt of PGE Co may become an overwhelming anchor around the parent companys neck in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help

Duke Energy Offers FixedPriced Electricity Package for SDGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Duke Energy through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE M W electricity load The offer would establish a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for wholesale power supply for the next five years based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENA s proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in commen ts submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electric ity market ANALYSIS As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere SDGE customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity last summer and into this fall which resulted primarily from an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California In addition other contributory factors have included the states economic growth lack of new power plants over the last decade unstable existing generation and the uncertainty of import prospects As SDGEs rate freeze had been lifted last spring customers of the utilit y were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded cents per kilowatthour compared to the cent per kilowatt hour maximum they had become accustomed to under the rate freeze The problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices However SDGE customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for Californias other two IOUs SCE and PGE DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power for the totality of SDGEs MW electricity load In return DENAs proposed fixed rate of cents per kilowatt hour plus annual percent increases presumably will be much lower than the cost SDGE customers will continue to face without such a contract DENAs proposal has been made possible as a result of FERCs proposed order that was issued last month outlining a major overhaul of Californias energy market Since competition began in the state in the spring of the three California IOUs were required to buy their power from the states Power Exchange FERCs order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a very lucrative contract while at the same time attempting to protect SDGE customers from exorbitant electricity prices So what is SDGEs response to DENAs proposal I spoke with Doug Kline spokesperson for the utility yesterday afternoon Kline pointed out that first of all SDGE has not yet received any offer from DENA and that all weve seen thus far is a press release Kline suggested that it was a public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal to FERC and that ultimately SDGE would be the one to accept DENAs offer In order to speak in detail on DENAs proposal Kline said he would need to see an actual contract which has yet to materialize Kline did disclose that locking up longterm contracts for SDGE customers based on todays high prices would have to be seriously questioned by the utility especial ly considering that new generation will be coming online in California over the next few years Beyond that SDGE is fielding other offers from energy suppliers and in fact has established longterm contracts with other providers which remain unidentified for percent of the power it buys on the wholesale market Back in September the CPUC granted approval for SDGE as well as SCE and PGE to purchase percent of its power in forward markets with the other percent still coming from the PX For SDGE this amounts to MW of its total electricity load Kline said that SDGE would need to compare DENAs offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDGE customers At the same time Sempra EnergySDGEs parent companyhas made its o wn proposal to FERC urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDGE customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates based on generators actual fees Under FERCs proposed order the commission suggested a soft rate cap of MWh Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generator setting a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to as it says fix the crisis in California In fact back in August DENA offered California Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver MW of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie s and provide all three IOUs with fiveyear fixedpriced supply contracts Although Gov Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three IOUs SCE and PGE proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts with DENA Both deals were sealed within the last month although the speci fic prices of the contracts are proprietary DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state Just two weeks ago the company broke ground on a million modernization of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County The modernization effor t is projected to add MW of new capacity to sites current MW and create the states largest power plant DENA claims that when complete d the MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale electricity to serve approximately million households In addition DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to modernize and expand two other power plants in California Morro Bay and South Bay power plants DENAs motivations are pretty understandable The company may espouse good intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but realistically energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state I started to notice the trend last month as Q earnings were reported Virtua lly every company that is active in Californias wholesale market reported a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatili ty DENA was no exception As a whole Duke Energy reported record Q earnings of per share a percent increase over earnings per share of for Q The companys North American Wholesale Energycomprised of DENA and Duke Energy Merchantsposted sharply higher gains with EBIT of million a percent increase over Q According to Duke Energy s report DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power plants and from natural gas and power trading activities DENA remains on schedule to deliver approximately megawatts of new merchant generation nationally in time for summer Moreover it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENAs offer truly benefit s SDGE and its customers The proposal certainly benefits DENA however especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current high prices and includes annual increases Securing SDGE customers under these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market but how it stacks up against SDGEs other unnamed offers remains to be seen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Peace Software a global provider of leading ebusiness solutions for retai l energy companies announced that MidAmerican Energy Company a supplier of energy in the Midwests deregulating market has selected Peaces Energy software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets Peace Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels services and locations on a single statement said Todd Raba vice preside nt of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy ANALYSIS This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies On the national or international stage Des Moines Iowabased MidAmerican may not be considered a major player Yet within the Midwest it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence The company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than MW of diversified power generation facilities around the world providing both regulated and unregulated electric and naturalgas services to more than million customers in six states and the United Kingdom through its Northern Electr ic Gas subsidiary In August MidAmerican made its move into Ohio the fourth largest US market in terms of customers behind California Texas and Florida indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive Midwest market Just last Monday MidAmerican became the first energy compa ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier CRES in the Cincinnati Gas Electric Co territory in southwest Ohio An essential element to the utilitys growth is a comprehensive billing software system which is where the value of Peace Software comes in According to MidAmerican it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Also important to MidAmerican as it enters different states is the elimination of several automated and manual processes required by our current system This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software In this particular case Peaces Energy software will provide to MidAmerica n customers several selfserve features including customer enrollment summa ry billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in a onestopshop tool Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra cts prior to this one with MidAmerican including Enron BC Gas Dominion Retai l Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services The company is based in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utilities I spoke with Brian Peace CEO of Peace Software last June and he gave an overview of how the Energy System functions First the Energy System is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another Since its start in Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multipleproduct architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water gas and electricity into one product suite Currently the system handles not only those three commodities but also can consolidate billing information relat ed to telecommunications home security home mortgaging and other valueadded commodities and services The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing At the time of our discussion Peace said ESPs can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore Theyve got to be able to buy it at the right price combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers This is the path to being competiti ve and profitable Over the last decade Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand market and began selling its technology in the United States in That same year the company secured a contract with Enron which at the time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California retail market Of course Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin g efforts in California but still uses the Peace Energy software as it continues to penetrate other markets Peace Softwares alliance with InSITEa New Yorkbased application service providerhas led to providing the softwar e for the billing needs of Exelon Brian Peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers Of course although Peace Softwares contract with MidAmerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market the billing software business presents stiff competition Perhaps the two greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy SCT offers the SCT Banner product which was originally created to bill multiple commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well ENLOGIX uses the SCT Banner system to support multiservices across its client base including gas financing ancillary products electricity water and solid waste Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and Australia Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets Peace has entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver which serves about customers Excelergy has implemented its billing product at Boston Gas which serves about customers As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multifaceted billing and customer care system Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the valueadded service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line Obsessively Relentlessly At Your Service The company is obviously making customer service a centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite to support its entry into new markets

Pennsylvania Customers Continues to Go Green By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company reported that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Competitive Default Service Agreeme nt between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost customers The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few days ANALYSIS As you may recall a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount ain about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energys service territory Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately residential electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service provider registered within the state This represented about percent of PECOs residential customer base Three energy providersTNPC Green Mountain and one other unidentified companybid for the customers with various service packages PECO chose TNPC which had offered a fixed discou nt of percent for the residential customers because it believed the offer was in the best interest of PECO customers Green Mountain contested this decision arguing that its hydro and natural gasbased energy package would ultimately be less expensive for consumers and environmentally cleaner Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed offer was a full percent less than PECOs shopping credit compared to TNPCs offer which would average about percent below the shopping credit PECOs response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer Over the last month both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECOs customers which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most successful retail market in the United States if not the world The PUC ruling clearly puts the PECO customers into the hands of TNPC which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing alliance between Enron AOL and IBM Securing the residential customers in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the Pennsylvania market The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not shopped for an alternative supplier under the states electric competition program However what I find most interesting about the latest development in this case is whats happening behind the scenes of the dispute and more specifically how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective I discussed just two weeks ago IssueAlert from Nov that TNPCs stock NYSE NPW was taking a nosedive Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in early October TNPCs IPO offering of million common shares was priced at per share a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has only been in existence since May of this year Momentum grew as the first day of trading saw the stock price climb to Yet contrast that with the current stock price of as of Nov and certainly questions about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge The decline in TNPC stock seemed to start when the company reported a Q loss of million or per share TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due its limited operating history but investors seemed to think otherwise Around the same time that TNPCs stock began to drop the company announced that it would be adding windgenerated energy to its package for customers in the Philadelphia area Under terms of a brandnew agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen t in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania My reaction to this announcemen t was that TNPCs addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain Yet TNPCs move toward renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock price In another ironic twist TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh ip with Green Mountain which was an adversary only last month TNPC disclosed that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition of up to competitive default service customers out of the within PECOs territory Reportedly the relationship will benefit Pennsylvania consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals In addition TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner is consistent with its objective of enhancing a positive customer portfoli o value However considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of the customers from PECO it seems odd that the company would sudden ly be willing to share of them with Green Mountain Certainly Green Mountain wins from this partnership The company gains residential customers when it based on the PUCs ruling could have ended up with nothing The company offers three service packages in Pennsylvania EcoSmart EnviroBlend and Natures Choice varying mixes of hydro natural gas and new renewables with Natures Choice containing more renewables than the other two power blends Marketing power that it bills as dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy What remains very unclear is TNPCs true motivations and the future of the company which made such a big splash when it began operating last spring Is this a classic case of an energy startup chasing down trends eg the current high value of renewable energy stocks in order to rejuvenate itself or a true identity transformation The questions are pertinent as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to struggle DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Strategic and Competitive

IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countri es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will repre sent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europ e to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billi on cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decisi on is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merge r strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategi c contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas tradin g and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci al endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japan s first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals includin g Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From

Columbia By Susan Kellogg Issues Analyst DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD AES Corporation announced further international expansion through its acquisition of KMR Power Corporation KMR a privately owned electric power plant developer and operator in Colombia South America KMR has controlling interest in three natural gasfired power plants having a total capacity of approximately MW AES will be acquiring two of the three natural gasfired power plants located in Cartagena through a interest in the MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a interest in the MW Mamonal plant ANALYSIS AES continues its nonstrategy of acquisitions in the purchase of KMR In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke AES CEO I asked him sever al times about AES strategic plans to which he answered We dont have one Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the megapower company due to its decentralized structure Decisions are made in response to a unique company mission which is to serve the world and steward its resources making clean safe reliable electricity available So why venture into Colombia a hotbed of political and social upheaval with an uncertain business environment A risky business by many energy companies standards But AES has created a dramatic international network guided not essentially by the almighty dollar according to Bakke Well go anywhere we are needed or wanted and can live our values and principle s So given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central America KMR is a prime target AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu lly penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they do what they do best buy command and redirect electric service from that monopoly into a clean reliable and democratically supported power service AES has made headlines throughout the year with its continuing list of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile Bolivia Argentina Dominican Republic El Salvador England Tanzania Venezuela Puerto Rico Brazil Bulgaria Republic of Georgia and most recently Oman The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility CA La Electricidad de Caracas EDC captured the headlines for several months earlier this year AES was involved in what was billed as a hostile takeover in a process that intrigued the energy community AES purchased approximately American Depository Shares ADSs including ADSs subject to guaranteed deliveries representing approximat ely of the outstanding shares Dennis W Bakke commended the Comision Nacio nal de Valores the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission on its final action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts to close the deal But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive signal for foreign investment in Venezuela We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot better job than was being done by EDC We didnt give a second thought about controversy We knew this was the right thing to do Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy and powerful families for many years AES has the clout the money and the mission to go in shake things up and in line with AES goals to create a stronger economy a more competitive society The strategy in Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America Weve made a lot of changes in the company and its not only going to change Venezuela but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor ing states as well Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission although admitti ng that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge Our position and principles seem to always be under attack said Bakke I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees its role in the world the way we do But our purpose has grown over the years and actually deepened as weve expanded further and further into the world AES has had another winning year A world leader in generation its value has doubled in the past year Generating assets include one hundred and twentyfive facilities totaling over MW of capacity world wide Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi c philosophy So far AES seems to have been touched by an angel in its endeavors into areas where others fear to tread For the complete

Trends for Commodity Trading Supply Chain Exchanges Explored at Conference By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Approximately industry executives were in attendance at the first day of the Energy Exchanges Online conference held Monday through Wednesday of this week in Scottsdale Ariz The conference was presented by Londonba sed EyeforEnergy In morning keynote presentations from Mark Crosno executive vice president of Altra Energy Technologies and Keith Butler COO DukeSolutions issues of how deregulation and the Internet have spawned a new speciest he eutilitywere discussed A key focus of the conference was the growing focus on online exchanges and how the entire value chain for the wholesale energy market is being impacted by new technologies ANALYSIS I attended and also spoke on a panel discussion during the first day of this conference What I found particularly noteworthy about the dialogue taking place was that despite participation from diverse sectors of the energy industryutilities regulators consultants ESPs IT infrastructure providers and othersseveral key points were reiterated throughout the discussion First there is little doubt left that ecommerce and new technologies are changing the entire complexion of the energy industry Resulting from that dynamic energy companies presently find themselves in a transformatio n related to how they will and should conduct their businesses While new technologies certainly offer new opportunities for companies to expand information and services that already exist in an electronic form question s still remain about how much the market itself will bear in terms of buildin g new online exchanges for ecommerce As noted the conference focused on online exchanges Within my presentatio n I discussed that essentially four different kinds of exchanges have emerged within the last months supply chain commodity trading transmission and retail exchanges A supply chain exchange exists primarily to line up buyers and sellers of parts related to the energy industry with the end goals of lower product prices and procurement processing costs exposur e to a worldwide audience and shorter order and fulfillment cycles A commod ity trading exchange exists for companies engaged in bulk wholesale trading to buy and sell energy packages A new form of exchange is emerging with transmission exchanges We dont know a whole lot about them yet but a group of utilities in the Midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange that would be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around transmission assets and the market How a transmission exchange would correlate with an RTOwhich also manages transmission flowis not yet clear Finally the retail online providers could also be considered a form of exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the Internet With that established several key issues will rise to the forefront in as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment enters its second year First and foremost establishing neutrality seems to be the primary challenge Questions were raised at the conference about trading exchanges established by a proprietary participant that is involved in every buy or sell on that particular exchange The general consensus among those present at the conference was that although concerns about neutrality have not prevented exchanges such as EnronOnline from becoming very successful regulatory pressure from the FTC may eventually make neutrality a requirement In addition when given a choice over various exchanges on which to participate the sense that I got from the dialogue was that traders would arguably prefer to participate on an exchange where issues of disclosing competitive information are not a concern The second trend as we move forward is liquidity With regard to commodity exchanges what participants want and what makes an exchange the most successful is liquidity meaning essentially the amount of transactions on the excha nge and consequently the opportunity to access beneficial deals A point that I made in my presentation is that the larger exchanges naturally seem to have the most liquidity Again the example of EnronOnline which reportedly has now logged over billion in transactions cannot be overlooked This raises the question of whether or not smaller exchanges will even find opportunities to move into such a saturated market As a result a related trend that I see is the consolidation of existing exchanges along with a blending of current business models into one exchange format As companies realize that it is already fairly late in the game to be building an exchange the smart move may be to join or merge with an alreadyexistin g format I think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to gain a lock on various market niches The third trend that should emerge over the next year is the separation of commodities Traders will want the flexibility of having separate platfo rms for different commodities including power natural gas bandwidth etc Dynegydirect is already moving in that direction by offering separate tradi ng floors that allow traders to group products in a customized way I think we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option The trends I mentioned here have focused mostly on commodity trading That is primarily due to the fact that we simply dont know enough about how several prominent supply chain exchanges will operate Enporion just last week logged its first transactions five reverse auctions in which UGI was the buyer of natural gas Pantellos still has another month or so before it comes online Of course there are many smaller supply chain exchanges like UtilityFrontier municipaloriented RAPIDpartsmart and Bexcom but the general consensus at the conference was that all supply chain exchanges will need to provide significant cost savings for participants and that has yet to be universally demonstrated Most observers of this particular trend are reserving judgment until next year when realtime results are disclosed Moreover the evolving energy marketplace is providing many new opportuniti es for energy companies to redefine themselves and develop new business models However much of the water that energy companies may be venturing into is uncharted territory The risks and competition associated with building an online exchange can be formidable and may dissuade some energy companie s from developing in that direction The question is as we move further down the path of an ebased energy industry can energy companies avoid participation in some form of an exchange As always the answer will proba bly be found along the bottom line which for many of these exchanges should emerge sometime over the next year DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December LADWP Continues to Shine Despite Californias Dark Period By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

December Issue webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Naturalgas Prices Hit Astonishing Highs Will Coal and Nuclear Benefit By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD According to a Dec report in the Wall Street Journal naturalgas prices which already had been rising all year shot up percent to an alltime high of per million BTUs on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange Today reports are circulating that spot prices at the Southern California border reached an astounding on Wednesday breaking the Daily Gas Price Indexs alltime record high of The sharp increases are viewed as a reaction to cold weather in the Northeast and forecasts of more to come Projections continue to indicate that naturalgas customers will see sharp increases in their heating bills very soon The current increase has result ed from a volatile mixture of rising demand and decreased supplies for natural gas which has driven up prices by a total of percent or more than since a year ago The uncertain future of naturalgas supplies may be a contributing factor to an unexpected resurgence of interest in coalfi red and nuclear power ANALYSIS Unfortunately we are starting to see real evidence of the projec ted rise in naturalgas prices just as temperatures start to take their downwa rd slope across most of the United States Two months ago the Department of Energy predicted that households using natural gas would see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills with prices rising about percent on average Weve actually been seeing the price increase since June of this year when naturalgas hit a thenunprecedented mark of per million BTUs At that time it was a shock to see those kinds of spikes for natural gas especially since the energy source is typically used mostl y in the wintertime for heating Yet now as we move into the coldest months of the season I project that the alltimehighs of to per million BTUs are something that might become all too common for the near term The Wall Street Journal article on the price spikes also reported that the American Gas Association estimated that as of Nov there were about trillion cubic feet of gas in storage This represented an percent decrease from the fiveyear average for that date The United States is mostly selfreliant when it comes to naturalgas supplies and as Ive discussed in previous columns the fact that a reported percent of federal lands has been placed off limits for naturalgas drilling certai nly adds to the concern about future supplies The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibited drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground Yet at the same time substitute forms of power generation such as coal and nuclear have been restricted or downgraded in favor of natural gas which has only exacerbated the current demand on supply EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years Certainly the public resistance toward nuclear power has been well documented which has thwarted any plann ed production of a new nuclear plant Ironically it seems to me that we now find ourselves at a crossroads in this industry that may in fact lead to a resurgence of coalfired and nucle ar power Especially in states such as Texas and Oklahoma which are very reliant on naturalgas supplies the current uncertainty about the availability of natural gas and reasonable prices poses a major dilemma Despite the recent trend of moving away from these two forms of power I can point to several developments indicating that the current predicament could creat e a forced reliance on these power substitutes First lets look at coal Its been widely postulated that coal is cheaper and easier to produce than natural gas and its supplies are certainly more abundant As recently as this year coal has accounted for about percent of the electricity produced in the United States although that majorityhold over power production has come under attack Emission requirements have forced many generators to shut down or minimize the use of their coalfired generating stations In fact a group of seven utilitiesAEP Cinergy Illinois Power Southern Indiana Gas Electric Southern Company and Tampa Electric Companyhave been hit with a lawsuit by the EPA claiming that they contributed to some of the most severe environmental problems facing certain parts of the United States Specifically the EPA has claime d that the utilities violated the Clean Air Act with emissions from their coalfired power plants Currently while naturalgas prices have soared coal prices have remained comparatively low and stable In addition clean coal technologies are being put into place to reduce the amount of particulates released from coalfired plants As a result many generating companies are hedging their bets that the rise in natural gas prices will continue by maintaining or increasing their coalfired generation For example AEP is the nations leading consumer of coal Reportedly about percent of AEPs electric generation is made at coalfired plants In response to the naturalgas price spikes AEP confirmed that it will continue to operate all of its coalfired plants at full capacity despite the ongoing lawsuit from the EPA Proponents of coal are using the socalled natural gas crisis as an opportunity to argue that electricity from coal can be provided at about half the cost of other fossil fuels and is less costly and more reliable than intermitten t power sources such as wind and solar In addition coal proponents say that the cost of electricity would double if the United States were to replace all existing coalgenerated power plants with alternative forms of power Nuclear power also could stand to benefit from the comprised supplies and high prices of natural gas Following the growing interest among several European and Asian countries several US utilities have expressed recent interest in expanding their nuclear assets Corbin McNeill cohead of Exelon Corp on Monday stated that new nuclear plants are needed and one will definitely be built in the next five to years McNeill also noted that the question of whether a new nuclear plant was built would depend on a sustained increase in prices for natural gas which remains the curren t fuel of choice for new power plants However he rejected the notion that building new nuclear plants would require the Energy Departments Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository to be operational an event that probably wont happen until Entergy is another example of a company that continues to aggressively pursue nuclear power and may spark other companies to do the same in respon se to high naturalgas prices In late November Entergy announced that it would submit a counteroffer for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant which is already in the midst of being sold to rival buyer AmerGen Energy the joint venture between Exelon and British Energy Entergy which has been developing a strong nuclear platform for some time believes that the Northeastern United States offers a strong market potential for nuclear power and plans to increase its offer for the Yankee plant and trump AmerGens standing offer of million The next few months especially as temperatures continue to drop should be very telling on two counts First will we continue to see the recordbreaking prices for natural gas I say yes Second what impact will these price spikes have on coal and nuclear I think they should only have a positive impact on future development of these two forms of power However the question is whether or not new production of coal and nuclear can be put into place fast enough to minimize the potentially disastrous impact from the low supplies and resultant rising prices of natural gas Only time will have the answer to these questions

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Allegheny Energy Solutions an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy Inc has added Siemens Solar Industries LP to its growing portfolio of suppliers for distributed generation products Through its new agreement with Siemens Solar Industries Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions called earthsafe v The systems are suited for industrial commercial an d residential applications The new partnership further advances Alleghenys strategy of becoming a national energy supplier ANALYSIS This partnership comes on the heels of Alleghenys recently announced agreement to purchase three gasfired merchant plants from Enron North America Both deals reaffirm Alleghenys intent to expand its geographic footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability In my opinion Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further ed very aggressive generation expansion plans this year announcing one acquisition or development after another The company has added seven new offices in the northeastern United States over the last year and has disclosed that it will open new offices in the Southeast in to begin preparing for the albeit slow move to competition in that region The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its service offerings Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens portfolio of companies specializing in high and medium voltage protection and substation control systems power and distribution transformers system planning and decentralized energy supply systems Siemens Solar claims to be the number one provider of solarpower solutions in the world having shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of MW The company has been in business for about years and reached a mileston e of MW in Thus the company has doubled its production output in just four years Siemens Solar offers an array of solarrelated products As noted Alleghen y Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemens earthsafe platform which accord ing to information on Siemens Website is offered in four models ranging in DC power from watts to watts The earthsafe system consists of solar modules universal roof mounting kits DCAC inverters and interconn ect hardware The intent is that businesses and residences would install the earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs the remainder supplied by more traditional means and contribute to the efforts of reduci ng emissions from fossil fuel plants Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that the addition of the Siemens product to its service offerings positions it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer a complete onsite power solution I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly diversifies the companys service offerings Although the jury is still out regarding the profitability of solar power along with other forms of distributed and renewable energy sources for Allegheny the move makes sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy solutions Allegheny Energy Supply where most of the generation expansion efforts of its parent are focused develops competitive generation solution s eg cogeneration green power etc for a variety of end users Within the last year Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving from a regional player into a national energy supplier resulting primarily from its success in the strong Northeast market This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation on the part of the unregulated company Earlier this year Allegheny Energy Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energys Mitchel l Power Station in New Eagle Pa Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent company This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine in the Northeast The diversification of Alleghenys generation arsenal is also important because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors Allegheny must surely know that companies like Dominion Reliant and AESjust to name a feware also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar eas across the country Thus by adding diverse power options to its service offerings Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its energy supply packages I observed several months ago that Allegheny was probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani es that are strong in generation This partnership with Siemens seems to indic ate that distributed generation including solar power could become that niche As a sidenote Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard Poors Index earlier this week So the announcement that the company is diversify ing into solar power comes at a time when as CEO Alan Noia puts it our stron g growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance have received recognition The SP Index is widely regarded as the standard for measuring largecapitalization US stock market performance As of yesterday Dec Allegheny Energys stock NYSE AYE was priced at The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens not Allegheny Energy Solutions Competition among companies that develop products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late and there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability of this market One direct competitor to Siemens that Ive tracked recently is Evergreen Solar a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts in half the required use of silicon which is needed for most solarpo wer technologies Evergreen Solar which recently became a publicly traded company has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and that it may never become a profitable company The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries so the compan y may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power units This is of course an issue for Siemens and not Allegheny to address Under its partnership with Siemens Allegheny attains all the value of solar power technologies and little of the risks Thus this appea rs to be a smart venture for Allegheny and one that should strongly benefit its power supply opportunities

Issue at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml Not just news analysis Miss last week Catch up on the latest analyses of the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Backers of a plan to create a publicly owned power system in San Francisco and Brisbane Calif got a financial boost recently with a panel approving in taxpayer money to study public power and related issues Most of the money will be used to study how the proposed municipality district would work and how it would be financed The Board of Supervisors Finance Committee approved the spending but put of the money on reserve pending the selection of contractors to perform the study and determine the scope of the work ANALYSIS This news item circulated about two weeks ago but it still deser ves attention as this could have tremendous impact on PGE The announcement of the municipalization study comes at arguably the worst possible time for PGE as the utility already faces a multitude of financial and public relations problems Yet in fact the issue has been developing for several months Back in July supporters of municipalization in PGEs service territory turned in a petition with signatures calling for the creat ion of a municipal utility district meaning that electric service would be provided by a city rather than an investorowned utility First let me provide some brief context regarding PGEs current condition The utility is in debt of over billion due to uncollected fees related to the price spikes of last summer PGEs objective is to bill its custome rs for this debt and toward that end has petitioned to raise its rates with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC Under PGEs plan average residential monthly bills reportedly would increase from about to on Jan Naturally consumer activist groups such as TURN that carefully monitor PGEs every move have contested the rate increase arguing that the utility alone is responsible for the debt it currently faces Since it is uncertain if the CPUC will grant PGEs petition speculation that the utility will become financially insolvent has begun to grow Both San Francisco and the smaller city of Brisbane to the south are includ ed in the study because municipalization must include two separate cities in order to take effect If municipalization is ultimately approved these two cities would form a new district and elect directors who would then attempt to purchase PGEs power grid in the area Proponents of the muni bypass effort say that the cities can provide less expensive power to customers than PGE as the utility must pay dividends to stockholders and compensate wellpaid executives PGE has already start ed damage control in response to the study arguing against the formation of a municipal utilities district First the utility has said simply that it is not for sale but more importantly it is PGEs contention that customers would not necessarily save money if the cities in question were to municipalize their electric districts In addition PGE says the cost for the cities to buy its assetsnecessary power plants utility lines and other infrastructurewould run about billion which in fact would make the project more expensive in the long run for customers Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield is spearheading the municipalization effort and is using the problems in San Diego as a means to support his case His name may sound familiar as Rosenfield has been involved in many seemingly antiinvestor owned utility IOU measures in California Back in Rosenfield led the fight for Proposition which would have essentially put a screeching halt on deregulation in the state Although Prop was ultimately defeated at the ballot had it passed the measure would have stopped the three California IOUs from charging customers for the costs associated with billion in bonds they had sold to pay for the percent rate cut that customers began receiving in January Prop would have blocked the utilities from recouping any of their stranded costs which of course SDGE has now accomplished and reportedly the other IOUs SCE and PGE are close to doing so as well Rosenfield was a key particip ant in Californians Against Utility Taxes CUT which lobbied repeatedly for electric rates to be reduced by percent for small consumers as opposed to the percent that was included in the states restructuring bill Along with this study related to specific cities there reportedly is a simultaneous movement from Governor Gray Davis for a state takeover of the power transmission grid power plants and governmentsponsored construction of new generating plants In early December an internal memo was leaked indicating that the governor was considering these measures as a response to the tight supplies and high prices seen in San Diego last summer Includ ed in the plan would be a restructuring of the states power system wherein the grid of transmission lines and power plants would be placed under state control Among several points on which PGE and the governor disagree Davis has proposed an extended rate freeze for customers of all of the three states IOUs While PGE is pushing for a rate increase Californias highest official reportedly would implement an indefinite rate freeze that would further complicate PGEs plan to pull itself out of debt Municipalization attempts in cities across the United States have increased over the last two decades Just last week the city of Hermiston Ore was granted the right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilit ies that Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The Umatilla County Circuit Court has upheld the city of Hermistons right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilities Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The city has been trying to acquire those facilities since with the intent of forming its own utility to serve the commercial and residential customers now served by Pacific Power Of course even though this is a significant ruling it will remain embroiled in court for some time A jury trial to set the dollar amount of compensation for Pacific Powers facilities wont start until March Other wellpublicized municipalization attempts have taken place in Lakewood NY failed and a number of cities across Florida However despite the rise in muni bypass efforts the fact remains that no contested municipalization effort of any significant size has been successful since the one that occurred in Massena NY back in At that time the city of Massena offered lowcost hydropower and taxfree financing which made the municipalization attempt beneficial to citizens Today cities rarely can offer such advantages which had made it difficult for muni bypass efforts to succeed Statistics show that when given the option to develop a cityrun electric system by dissolving the incumbent utilitys authority citizens across the country have chosen to retain the IOU model Of course arguments could be made that in such cases the IOU lobbying force has been a formidable component wielding the capital necessary to wage a successful campaign to protect its business Yet at the same time a case can be made that the benefits of municipalization just have not been proven and that explains why citizens generally have opted to retain the IOU model There is both good and bad news for PGE related to this particular study The bad news is that studies such as these most often recommend municipalization which makes it very difficult for local politicians to resist a takeover In other words because the wheels have started turning toward municipalization in the area it is more than likely that PGE will have to engage in a battle to preserve its business Even though past history shows the attempt probably would not be successful if PGE contests it the bypass effort would result in PGE spending a lot of money and time to fight the effort The good news is that time is on the utilitys side Municipalization is usually a long and involved process The fact that the Finance Committee gave the green light to proceed with the study is only the first in many regulatory checkpoints The next steps are the full boards consideration of the funding request for the study and subsequently a decision whether or not to put municipalization on the local ballot Then the hard campaigni ng would begin to sway public opinion one way or the other Thus even if muncipalization of the two cities were to occur PGE still has some time to potentially resolve its debt situation and construct a strong opposition to the muni attempt However from a public relations standpoint this is just the last thing that PGE needs at this point The utility continues to spin media coverage to convey that it is only trying to recoup a debt that it accrued on behalf of its obligation to serve customers Adversaries such as TURN and Harvey Rosenfield however are just as aggressively working to convince the publi c that PGE is trying to unfairly stick customers with a billion tab To now have discussions emerge about whether or not city government could more effectively provide electric service is another fire that PGE will have to extinguish if it wants to remain operational

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Supply Chain Exchanges Explored at Conference By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Approximately industry executives were in attendance at the first day of the Energy Exchanges Online conference held Monday through Wednesday of this week in Scottsdale Ariz The conference was presented by Londonba sed EyeforEnergy In morning keynote presentations from Mark Crosno executive vice president of Altra Energy Technologies and Keith Butler COO DukeSolutions issues of how deregulation and the Internet have spawned a new speciest he eutilitywere discussed A key focus of the conference was the growing focus on online exchanges and how the entire value chain for the wholesale energy market is being impacted by new technologies ANALYSIS I attended and also spoke on a panel discussion during the first day of this conference What I found particularly noteworthy about the dialogue taking place was that despite participation from diverse sectors of the energy industryutilities regulators consultants ESPs IT infrastructure providers and othersseveral key points were reiterated throughout the discussion First there is little doubt left that ecommerce and new technologies are changing the entire complexion of the energy industry Resulting from that dynamic energy companies presently find themselves in a transformatio n related to how they will and should conduct their businesses While new technologies certainly offer new opportunities for companies to expand information and services that already exist in an electronic form question s still remain about how much the market itself will bear in terms of buildin g new online exchanges for ecommerce As noted the conference focused on online exchanges Within my presentatio n I discussed that essentially four different kinds of exchanges have emerged within the last months supply chain commodity trading transmission and retail exchanges A supply chain exchange exists primarily to line up buyers and sellers of parts related to the energy industry with the end goals of lower product prices and procurement processing costs exposur e to a worldwide audience and shorter order and fulfillment cycles A commod ity trading exchange exists for companies engaged in bulk wholesale trading to buy and sell energy packages A new form of exchange is emerging with transmission exchanges We dont know a whole lot about them yet but a group of utilities in the Midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange that would be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around transmission assets and the market How a transmission exchange would correlate with an RTOwhich also manages transmission flowis not yet clear Finally the retail online providers could also be considered a form of exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the Internet With that established several key issues will rise to the forefront in as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment enters its second year First and foremost establishing neutrality seems to be the primary challenge Questions were raised at the conference about trading exchanges established by a proprietary participant that is involved in every buy or sell on that particular exchange The general consensus among those present at the conference was that although concerns about neutrality have not prevented exchanges such as EnronOnline from becoming very successful regulatory pressure from the FTC may eventually make neutrality a requirement In addition when given a choice over various exchanges on which to participate the sense that I got from the dialogue was that traders would arguably prefer to participate on an exchange where issues of disclosing competitive information are not a concern The second trend as we move forward is liquidity With regard to commodity exchanges what participants want and what makes an exchange the most successful is liquidity meaning essentially the amount of transactions on the excha nge and consequently the opportunity to access beneficial deals A point that I made in my presentation is that the larger exchanges naturally seem to have the most liquidity Again the example of EnronOnline which reportedly has now logged over billion in transactions cannot be overlooked This raises the question of whether or not smaller exchanges will even find opportunities to move into such a saturated market As a result a related trend that I see is the consolidation of existing exchanges along with a blending of current business models into one exchange format As companies realize that it is already fairly late in the game to be building an exchange the smart move may be to join or merge with an alreadyexistin g format I think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to gain a lock on various market niches The third trend that should emerge over the next year is the separation of commodities Traders will want the flexibility of having separate platfo rms for different commodities including power natural gas bandwidth etc Dynegydirect is already moving in that direction by offering separate tradi ng floors that allow traders to group products in a customized way I think we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option The trends I mentioned here have focused mostly on commodity trading That is primarily due to the fact that we simply dont know enough about how several prominent supply chain exchanges will operate Enporion just last week logged its first transactions five reverse auctions in which UGI was the buyer of natural gas Pantellos still has another month or so before it comes online Of course there are many smaller supply chain exchanges like UtilityFrontier municipaloriented RAPIDpartsmart and Bexcom but the general consensus at the conference was that all supply chain exchanges will need to provide significant cost savings for participants and that has yet to be universally demonstrated Most observers of this particular trend are reserving judgment until next year when realtime results are disclosed Moreover the evolving energy marketplace is providing many new opportuniti es for energy companies to redefine themselves and develop new business models However much of the water that energy companies may be venturing into is uncharted territory The risks and competition associated with building an online exchange can be formidable and may dissuade some energy companie s from developing in that direction The question is as we move further down the path of an ebased energy industry can energy companies avoid participation in some form of an exchange As always the answer will proba bly be found along the bottom line which for many of these exchanges should emerge sometime over the next year DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to

Columbia By Susan Kellogg Issues Analyst DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD AES Corporation announced further international expansion through its acquisition of KMR Power Corporation KMR a privately owned electric power plant developer and operator in Colombia South America KMR has controlling interest in three natural gasfired power plants having a total capacity of approximately MW AES will be acquiring two of the three natural gasfired power plants located in Cartagena through a interest in the MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a interest in the MW Mamonal plant ANALYSIS AES continues its nonstrategy of acquisitions in the purchase of KMR In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke AES CEO I asked him sever al times about AES strategic plans to which he answered We dont have one Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the megapower company due to its decentralized structure Decisions are made in response to a unique company mission which is to serve the world and steward its resources making clean safe reliable electricity available So why venture into Colombia a hotbed of political and social upheaval with an uncertain business environment A risky business by many energy companies standards But AES has created a dramatic international network guided not essentially by the almighty dollar according to Bakke Well go anywhere we are needed or wanted and can live our values and principle s So given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central America KMR is a prime target AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu lly penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they do what they do best buy command and redirect electric service from that monopoly into a clean reliable and democratically supported power service AES has made headlines throughout the year with its continuing list of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile Bolivia Argentina Dominican Republic El Salvador England Tanzania Venezuela Puerto Rico Brazil Bulgaria Republic of Georgia and most recently Oman The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility CA La Electricidad de Caracas EDC captured the headlines for several months earlier this year AES was involved in what was billed as a hostile takeover in a process that intrigued the energy community AES purchased approximately American Depository Shares ADSs including ADSs subject to guaranteed deliveries representing approximat ely of the outstanding shares Dennis W Bakke commended the Comision Nacio nal de Valores the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission on its final action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts to close the deal But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive signal for foreign investment in Venezuela We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot better job than was being done by EDC We didnt give a second thought about controversy We knew this was the right thing to do Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy and powerful families for many years AES has the clout the money and the mission to go in shake things up and in line with AES goals to create a stronger economy a more competitive society The strategy in Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America Weve made a lot of changes in the company and its not only going to change Venezuela but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor ing states as well Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission although admitti ng that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge Our position and principles seem to always be under attack said Bakke I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees its role in the world the way we do But our purpose has grown over the years and actually deepened as weve expanded further and further into the world AES has had another winning year A world leader in generation its value has doubled in the past year Generating assets include one hundred and twentyfive facilities totaling over MW of capacity world wide Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi c philosophy So far AES seems to have been touched by an angel in its endeavors into areas where others fear to tread For the complete

IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countri es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will repre sent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europ e to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billi on cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decisi on is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merge r strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategi c contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas tradin g and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci al endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japan s first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals includin g Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From

Pennsylvania Customers Continues to Go Green By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company reported that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Competitive Default Service Agreeme nt between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost customers The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few days ANALYSIS As you may recall a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount ain about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energys service territory Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately residential electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service provider registered within the state This represented about percent of PECOs residential customer base Three energy providersTNPC Green Mountain and one other unidentified companybid for the customers with various service packages PECO chose TNPC which had offered a fixed discou nt of percent for the residential customers because it believed the offer was in the best interest of PECO customers Green Mountain contested this decision arguing that its hydro and natural gasbased energy package would ultimately be less expensive for consumers and environmentally cleaner Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed offer was a full percent less than PECOs shopping credit compared to TNPCs offer which would average about percent below the shopping credit PECOs response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer Over the last month both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECOs customers which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most successful retail market in the United States if not the world The PUC ruling clearly puts the PECO customers into the hands of TNPC which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing alliance between Enron AOL and IBM Securing the residential customers in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the Pennsylvania market The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not shopped for an alternative supplier under the states electric competition program However what I find most interesting about the latest development in this case is whats happening behind the scenes of the dispute and more specifically how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective I discussed just two weeks ago IssueAlert from Nov that TNPCs stock NYSE NPW was taking a nosedive Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in early October TNPCs IPO offering of million common shares was priced at per share a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has only been in existence since May of this year Momentum grew as the first day of trading saw the stock price climb to Yet contrast that with the current stock price of as of Nov and certainly questions about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge The decline in TNPC stock seemed to start when the company reported a Q loss of million or per share TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due its limited operating history but investors seemed to think otherwise Around the same time that TNPCs stock began to drop the company announced that it would be adding windgenerated energy to its package for customers in the Philadelphia area Under terms of a brandnew agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen t in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania My reaction to this announcemen t was that TNPCs addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain Yet TNPCs move toward renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock price In another ironic twist TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh ip with Green Mountain which was an adversary only last month TNPC disclosed that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition of up to competitive default service customers out of the within PECOs territory Reportedly the relationship will benefit Pennsylvania consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals In addition TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner is consistent with its objective of enhancing a positive customer portfoli o value However considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of the customers from PECO it seems odd that the company would sudden ly be willing to share of them with Green Mountain Certainly Green Mountain wins from this partnership The company gains residential customers when it based on the PUCs ruling could have ended up with nothing The company offers three service packages in Pennsylvania EcoSmart EnviroBlend and Natures Choice varying mixes of hydro natural gas and new renewables with Natures Choice containing more renewables than the other two power blends Marketing power that it bills as dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy What remains very unclear is TNPCs true motivations and the future of the company which made such a big splash when it began operating last spring Is this a classic case of an energy startup chasing down trends eg the current high value of renewable energy stocks in order to rejuvenate itself or a true identity transformation The questions are pertinent as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to struggle DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Strategic and Competitive

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Peace Software a global provider of leading ebusiness solutions for retai l energy companies announced that MidAmerican Energy Company a supplier of energy in the Midwests deregulating market has selected Peaces Energy software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets Peace Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels services and locations on a single statement said Todd Raba vice preside nt of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy ANALYSIS This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies On the national or international stage Des Moines Iowabased MidAmerican may not be considered a major player Yet within the Midwest it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence The company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than MW of diversified power generation facilities around the world providing both regulated and unregulated electric and naturalgas services to more than million customers in six states and the United Kingdom through its Northern Electr ic Gas subsidiary In August MidAmerican made its move into Ohio the fourth largest US market in terms of customers behind California Texas and Florida indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive Midwest market Just last Monday MidAmerican became the first energy compa ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier CRES in the Cincinnati Gas Electric Co territory in southwest Ohio An essential element to the utilitys growth is a comprehensive billing software system which is where the value of Peace Software comes in According to MidAmerican it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Also important to MidAmerican as it enters different states is the elimination of several automated and manual processes required by our current system This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software In this particular case Peaces Energy software will provide to MidAmerica n customers several selfserve features including customer enrollment summa ry billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in a onestopshop tool Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra cts prior to this one with MidAmerican including Enron BC Gas Dominion Retai l Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services The company is based in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utilities I spoke with Brian Peace CEO of Peace Software last June and he gave an overview of how the Energy System functions First the Energy System is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another Since its start in Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multipleproduct architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water gas and electricity into one product suite Currently the system handles not only those three commodities but also can consolidate billing information relat ed to telecommunications home security home mortgaging and other valueadded commodities and services The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing At the time of our discussion Peace said ESPs can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore Theyve got to be able to buy it at the right price combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers This is the path to being competiti ve and profitable Over the last decade Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand market and began selling its technology in the United States in That same year the company secured a contract with Enron which at the time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California retail market Of course Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin g efforts in California but still uses the Peace Energy software as it continues to penetrate other markets Peace Softwares alliance with InSITEa New Yorkbased application service providerhas led to providing the softwar e for the billing needs of Exelon Brian Peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers Of course although Peace Softwares contract with MidAmerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market the billing software business presents stiff competition Perhaps the two greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy SCT offers the SCT Banner product which was originally created to bill multiple commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well ENLOGIX uses the SCT Banner system to support multiservices across its client base including gas financing ancillary products electricity water and solid waste Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and Australia Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets Peace has entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver which serves about customers Excelergy has implemented its billing product at Boston Gas which serves about customers As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multifaceted billing and customer care system Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the valueadded service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line Obsessively Relentlessly At Your Service The company is obviously making customer service a centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite to support its entry into new markets

Duke Energy Offers FixedPriced Electricity Package for SDGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Duke Energy through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE M W electricity load The offer would establish a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for wholesale power supply for the next five years based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENA s proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in commen ts submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electric ity market ANALYSIS As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere SDGE customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity last summer and into this fall which resulted primarily from an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California In addition other contributory factors have included the states economic growth lack of new power plants over the last decade unstable existing generation and the uncertainty of import prospects As SDGEs rate freeze had been lifted last spring customers of the utilit y were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded cents per kilowatthour compared to the cent per kilowatt hour maximum they had become accustomed to under the rate freeze The problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices However SDGE customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for Californias other two IOUs SCE and PGE DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power for the totality of SDGEs MW electricity load In return DENAs proposed fixed rate of cents per kilowatt hour plus annual percent increases presumably will be much lower than the cost SDGE customers will continue to face without such a contract DENAs proposal has been made possible as a result of FERCs proposed order that was issued last month outlining a major overhaul of Californias energy market Since competition began in the state in the spring of the three California IOUs were required to buy their power from the states Power Exchange FERCs order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a very lucrative contract while at the same time attempting to protect SDGE customers from exorbitant electricity prices So what is SDGEs response to DENAs proposal I spoke with Doug Kline spokesperson for the utility yesterday afternoon Kline pointed out that first of all SDGE has not yet received any offer from DENA and that all weve seen thus far is a press release Kline suggested that it was a public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal to FERC and that ultimately SDGE would be the one to accept DENAs offer In order to speak in detail on DENAs proposal Kline said he would need to see an actual contract which has yet to materialize Kline did disclose that locking up longterm contracts for SDGE customers based on todays high prices would have to be seriously questioned by the utility especial ly considering that new generation will be coming online in California over the next few years Beyond that SDGE is fielding other offers from energy suppliers and in fact has established longterm contracts with other providers which remain unidentified for percent of the power it buys on the wholesale market Back in September the CPUC granted approval for SDGE as well as SCE and PGE to purchase percent of its power in forward markets with the other percent still coming from the PX For SDGE this amounts to MW of its total electricity load Kline said that SDGE would need to compare DENAs offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDGE customers At the same time Sempra EnergySDGEs parent companyhas made its o wn proposal to FERC urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDGE customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates based on generators actual fees Under FERCs proposed order the commission suggested a soft rate cap of MWh Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generator setting a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to as it says fix the crisis in California In fact back in August DENA offered California Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver MW of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie s and provide all three IOUs with fiveyear fixedpriced supply contracts Although Gov Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three IOUs SCE and PGE proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts with DENA Both deals were sealed within the last month although the speci fic prices of the contracts are proprietary DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state Just two weeks ago the company broke ground on a million modernization of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County The modernization effor t is projected to add MW of new capacity to sites current MW and create the states largest power plant DENA claims that when complete d the MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale electricity to serve approximately million households In addition DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to modernize and expand two other power plants in California Morro Bay and South Bay power plants DENAs motivations are pretty understandable The company may espouse good intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but realistically energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state I started to notice the trend last month as Q earnings were reported Virtua lly every company that is active in Californias wholesale market reported a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatili ty DENA was no exception As a whole Duke Energy reported record Q earnings of per share a percent increase over earnings per share of for Q The companys North American Wholesale Energycomprised of DENA and Duke Energy Merchantsposted sharply higher gains with EBIT of million a percent increase over Q According to Duke Energy s report DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power plants and from natural gas and power trading activities DENA remains on schedule to deliver approximately megawatts of new merchant generation nationally in time for summer Moreover it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENAs offer truly benefit s SDGE and its customers The proposal certainly benefits DENA however especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current high prices and includes annual increases Securing SDGE customers under these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market but how it stacks up against SDGEs other unnamed offers remains to be seen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

Advertising opportunities are also available on our website DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Co Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Last Wednesday PGE Co proposed a fiveyear rate stabilization plan that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than billio n in power costs incurred last summer Under PGEs plan submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC for approval average residential bills of would increase to about a month as of Jan This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes after an existing rate freeze ends by However a portion of the incre ase also would go to paying down the billion in unforeseen charges that PGE insists are not the utilitys responsibility ANALYSIS Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this past summer focused on San Diego Gas Electric SDGE the legacy of the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PGE and Southern California Edison SCE as both utilities have yet to fully enter competitive markets within the state This latest proposal from PGE is an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently carries Lets first understand how PGE found itself in the red since this is critical to the utilitys argument that customers should be responsible for the debt Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in its service territory PGE must its power on the wholesale market In addition under Californias restructuring mandates PGE had to buy its power out of the Power Exchange PX rather than establishing bilateral contracts with suppliers The combination of low supply and high demand drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer which PGE faced as a buyer Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect PGE has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers Although reports vary on average PGE has been paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market when by law it is only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour As a result of these factors PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting relief from its debt and also its argument thatsince it was obligated to buy the power for customers in the first placeits customers should ultimately carry the burden for the high costs PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off Consequently PGE has been lobbying to the CPUC for several months for various options that would all result in PGE custom ers picking up the billion tab The utility first proposed to retroactivel y bill customers for the debt This latest proposal changes the course a bit to provide for a rate increase but the end result would essentially be the same Under the proposal PGEs rate freeze would end Jan and resident ial and small business customers would begin paying cents per kilowatt hour for five years compared with the current wholesale costs of cents per kilowatt hour generation costs Without such a rate stabilizati on plan in place PGE warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more than after the rate freeze is lifted The utility also contends that the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summers high prices amounts to less than percent of the total monthly increases To reduce the impact on lowincome customers the utility plans to increase their discount to percent from the percent they currently receive PGE said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates proved not to be high enough to cover costs If the deficit of uncollected costs grew by billion for example then rates at the start of would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around percent to cents Skepticsincluding some within the CPUCsay PGE is simply looking to protect its own interests Carl Wood a CPUC commissioner referred to PGEs propo sal as volume two of their bailout request and noted that the request results in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the utilitys debt The consumer group TURN contends that PGE and not custome rs is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred The group also argues that although PGE has cast its proposal under a guise of customer protection the proposal only really serves to assure PGE of full recovery of its debt In addition TURN noted that PGE submitted its proposal to the CPUC on the day before Thanksgiving conceivably to downplay media attention and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC PGE remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal PGE believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers for debt it believes it accrued on its customers behalf PGEs proposal comes at a time when the utilitys reputation has taken a beating A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that the CPUC received more than complaints about PGE from to According to the report PGE received more than three times as many complaints per customer as SDGE during the past three years which is quite significa nt considering that SDGE customers were exposed to bills that increased by two and three times their normal amounts last summer The comparison betwee n PGE and SDGE was made because they are the only major private utilities in the state to offer both electric and gas service PGE also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide From to PGE complaints represented percent of the total filed with the CPUC even though it only has percent of gas customers and percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the state Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PGE concerned billing problems In its own defense PGE claims that it faces a unique set of weatherrelated conditions that make the service it provide s to customers more fraught with problems which consequently results in more complaints It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PGEs request but prior comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility s proposal will be rejected This casts a dark shadow over the future of PGE as without being able to bill customers for its debt it is uncertain how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent Ironically unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PGE Corp continue to perform well and show profits Yet the huge debt of PGE Co may become an overwhelming anchor around the parent companys neck in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Endesa NYSE ELE Spains largest power utility has signed an agreement with Charbonnages de France CDF to acquire a percent interest in the French electricity generator Societe Nationale dElectricite et de Thermiqu e SNET The transaction has been authorized by the French Government The agreement includes Endesas right to increase its interest in SNET in the medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies and allow Endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in France and Europe ANALYSIS The approval for Endesa to acquire percent interest in SNET cements the companys move into France which is a major component in the aggressive expansion efforts Endesa has been implementing this year SNET while a comparatively small company by American standards is still the second largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity and third largest in terms of electricity generation SNET owns five coal plants totaling megawatts which generate about GWh annually This is a very low output and in fact SNET accounts for only percent of the market share in France However given the fact that Frances larges t energy company EDF still has a hold on about percent of the market in the country any acquisition of the nextlargest company is a major coup The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the companys experience in coalbased electricitywhich still is the po wer source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent and its progressiveness in terms of technology Presently SNET sells the bulk of its electricity output to EDF under a longterm contract between the two companies The rest of its generation is sold to eligible customers In addition to its current assets SNET is also planning a new MW gasfired station in eastern France and is the front runner to build a new cleancoal plant in the heavily industriali zed Rhone Valley Thus as France slowly opens its market to competition SNET could emerge as one of the major providers Endesa was able to beat out other bidders for SNET including Frances Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and Germanys RWE due to the positive valuation of Endesas industrial and commercial projects and the economic value of its offer Endesa already entered the French market last month with a threeyear exclusive agreement to serve the energy needs of SEB a small appliance company The companys move outside of Spain resulted from several factors First the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of its largest electric companies essentially landlocking the domestic growt h of companies like Endesa and forcing them to look outward for growth opportunities In addition growth in countries like France and Germany is probably appeal ing to Endesa because their central location offers additional expansion opportunities into Italy and Eastern Europe Just within the last year privatization has come to the major European countrieseither all at once as in the case of Germany or in forced increments as occurred in France There has been little question that Endesa would like to develop generation interests across the Continent and has taken advantage of competitive opportunities as they have emerged In fact Endesa disclosed that it plans to become a leading European power player through the swap of assets with other electricity customers and through acquisitions Rumor has it that Endesa is also lookin g to acquire the generation assets of EnelItalys stateowned power and the biggest European rival to EDF However as Endesa expands abroad it continues to face significant problems in Spain due mostly to its proposed merger with the second largest electricity provider in the country Iberdrola Just last month Endesa announced that it had entered into a friendly merger with Iberdrola Together the two companies will gain a hold over percent of Spains power market with a combined market capitalization of the equivalent to billion Reported ly the merger will create the worlds thirdbiggest electricity company after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron However Spanish oil company Repsol which lost out on the bid for Iberdrola to Endesa continues to contemplate renew ing a hostile takeover of the company Repsol claims that it in fact offered more euros per share than what Endesa has promised to pay for Iberdrola in their billion merger but that Iberdrola did not even consider the bid Both Endesa and Repsol are partially owned by the Spanish government only percent of Endesa is publicly traded so presently negotiations are being held to see if a compromise can be reached Reportedly the merge r between Endesa and Iberdrola can occur only if some of the companies belong ing to the merged company are sold as per the Spanish antimonopoly legislation Ironically this could benefit Repsol as the company plans to invest in any companies that are divested due to the merger France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization across the Continent In fact France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the European Union While other European countries have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although Endesa is certainly pushing through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country A report from the Parisbased International Energy Agency issued just last week contends that Frances power liberalization law restricts power trading and allows EDF to keep its market advantages However even though Endesa may face expansion limitations in France it is important to remember how large the company is in its home country Endesa produces about half of Spains electricity MW relying mainly on nuclear and coalfired plants Looking to diversify Endesa also owns interests in gas water and telecommunications companies It is the largest shareholder in Auna a jointly owned company with partners Telecom Italia and Unin Fenosa that controls Retevisin Spains secondlargest phone company behind Telefnica In addition Endesa is also investing heavily in energy firms in Latin America Thus although France is very important for Endesas European expansion efforts the company is still a contender in other key markets DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy NYSE DYN and NRG Energy NYSE NRG announced a major expansion of their coowned generation portfolio in the West through asset purchase agreements to acquire MW of power generation facilities from Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP The facilities include the MW gasfired Clark Generating Station and MW of the MW coalfired Reid Gardner Generating Station The facilities are currently owned by Sierra Pacific Resources subsidiary Nevada Power Company and serve the growing Las Vegas market ANALYSIS This million purchase has resulted from regulatory mandates surrounding the Sierra PacificNevada Power merger which was completed in July Sierra Pacific is undergoing the sale and transfer of all of its remaining gas oil and naturalgas fired Nevada generating assets which it intends to complete in The Reid Gardner and Clark Stations are among the seven asset bundles that were included in an auction by Sierra Pacific earlier this year Located in southeastern Las Vegas the Clark Generating Station consists of gas and oilfired generating units which as noted total MW The oldes t unit at the Clark Generating Station became operational in the newest in Specific information about which units at the Clark Generating Station are included in this purchase was not available The Reid Gardner Generating Station consists of four baseload coalfired units and is locate d miles northeast of Las Vegas According to recent data from the Energy Information Administration the California Department of Water Resources owns about percent of the Reid Gardner Plant It is not clear what impac t the Dynegy NRG purchase will have on this organizations ownership in the plant The purchase of the Sierra Pacific assets is subject to approval from the Federal Trade Commission FERC and the Nevada Public Utilities Commission and is expected to close during the second quarter of Additional conditions of the deal include a power purchase agreement for Nevada Power to buy energy and ancillary services from Dynegy and NRG at a stable price until March On their own both companies are leaders in independent power production and energy supply Yet this acquisition is the latest in a string of collaborative efforts between Dynegy and NRG Together the companies have been actively acquiring power plants in Illinois and the West Coast along with purchases that they have made independently In fact this purchase of assets from Sierra Pacific marks the sixth asset alliance between Dynegy and NRG Together the two companies jointly own MW of power generation facilities in California and MW in Illinois In most of the partnerships and in the case of this latest purchase from Sierra Pacific Dynegy markets the energy produced at the plants and oversees fuel management services while NRG manages the operational side Last July Dynegy and NRG entered into a similar agreement to expand the Rocky Road Power Plant a natural gasfired simple cycle peaking facility in East Dundee Illinois The move into Illinois was an important strategy for both companies Of course Dynegy completed its merger with Illinova last summer creating a billion company that is wellpositioned to compete in electric generation wholesale and retail marketing and gas and electric power trading At the time the CEO of NRG Energy made it clear that the Rocky Road plant expansion was part of the two companies strategy in becoming a large contributor to the Chicagoarea energy market Dynegy in fact intends to continue acquiring and expanding generation facilities in Illinois so that it can compete with Exelon Corp Moreover both companies are positioning themselves to be leaders in generation capacity and power supply and the purchase of the MW from Sierra Pacific factors in to both of their strategies Not only does the acquisiti on help to expand both companies asset base but it also diversifies their power supply offerings For instance NRG claims that the assets complement its current gasfired peaking and intermediate California assets providing the benefits of fuel and dispatch level diversification NRG aims to build a top three position in its primary markets The acquisition of assets from Sierra Pacific puts NRG into a prime position in the fastgrowing Nevada and Western markets by adding a strong component of baseload generat ion to its portfolio In fact this is the second acquisition that NRG has made from Sierra Pacif ic Just last month NRG announced its intent to purchase a percent interest in the Valmy Power Station which Sierra Pacific is selling also as a resul t of regulatory mandates The Valmy Power Station which is primarily coalfired produces electricity in the northern Nevada and surrounding markets In this million deal NRG acted as an independent buyer Dynegy has long claimed that it wants to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five year by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others In order to reach this goal I had projected last summer that Dynegy might be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale considering the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies The compan y has now taken a different path to achieve essentially the same result The addition of Sierra Pacifics facilities combined with other assets that the company has acquired or developed this year increases Dynegys generating capacity by more than gross megawatts Dynegy contends that this figure is comparable to many industry mergers without the regulat ed transmission and distribution businesses Dynegy also believes the acquisit ion will support a raise in its earnings forecast for from to per share Dynegys goals are pretty ambitious However the company has been increasi ng earnings over the last year so the per share target may be attainabl e For Q Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the compan ys consolidated net income There is little doubt that Dynegy and NRG considering that they own MW of power in the state benefited from the short supplies in California this summer whichalong with other factorsdr ove up the cost for power in the state Another interesting element to this announcement is the fact that similar strategic acquisitions are being made possible by mandated divestiture that other companies have faced due to merger activity Just yesterday I wrote about Duke and Williams embarking on a joint venture to purchase the Gulfstream pipeline project from Coastal Corp This sale was made possi ble because Coastal is being forced to divest the pipeline as a result of its merger with El Paso Energy As the old adage goes one companys loss is another companys gain which could be viewed as one of the drawbacks of MA activity Another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing between companies The Duke Williams and Dynegy NRG projects are both examples of companies that have collaborated on development and acquisition ventures to support both their joint and individual strategies As the energy industry becomes more competitive likeminded companies may find that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by for example Southern Company DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Read SCIENTECHs free SourceBook Weekly article AES SourceBooks

industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Duke Williams to Buy Gulfstream from Coastal Corporation By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly purchase The Coastal Corporations percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project The purchase expected to be finalized by the end of this year is subject to federal regulatory approvals and conditione d upon completion of the Coastal El Paso Energy Corporation merger Financi al terms of the purchase were not disclosed ANALYSIS The Gulfstream project is a proposed mile steel pipeline designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida The project has been sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp a billion Houstonbased energy holding company with operations in naturalgas production distribut ion and marketing Coastal Corp is presently waiting for FERCs approval to build and operate the system However due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Corps pending merger with El Paso Energy Corp Coastal Corp was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project As a result Duke Energy and Williams have found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida market Until the merger is complete Coastal Corp will continue to develo p and market Gulfstream According to Coastal the billion Gulfstream project has already achie ved two important milestones in its FERC approval process preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues and a favorable draft environmental impact statement The company anticipates that the project will receive full FERC approval in the first quarter and that Gulfstream will become fully operational in June Approximately miles of the route which originates in Mobile Ala crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters Gulfstream offers billion cubic feet of naturalgas capacity per day and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and powergeneration facilities that plan on using highefficiency natural gas turbines Already the project has precedent agreements with large Flori da utilities and power generation facilities Upon completion of the purchase Duke and Williams will proceed with the jointly managed operation and development of the Gulfstream project Its not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be interested in making the acquisition The two companies which have historically had a collaborative relationship already own significant amounts of interstate naturalgas pipeline capacity Between its two subsidiaries involved in naturalgas productionDuke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission Duke Energy owns and operates about miles of pipeline and intersta te miles of capacity Williams five interstate natural gas pipelines reported ly deliver about percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States The companys vast mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada serving more than million residential commercial and industrial natural gas users In fact the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida a mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstrea m project will follow Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer project now that they are acquiring the Gulfstream project The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Florida The CEO of Williams gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market would support only one new pipeline coming into the state By joining together Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the highgrowth state as it eventually becomes competitive First among the priorities for the project is to ensur e adequate pipeline capacity by June and meeting the projected MW electric generation growth that is expected by Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project accelerates its own entry into Florida In fact Richard Priory Dukes CEO conceded at a conference last September that much of Dukes future success will result from its naturalgas operations Specifically Duke has been focused on merchant plant and naturalgas pipeline construction for some time As of this summer Duke was rated third in announced merchan t plants behind Calpine and Panda and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants and acquiring naturalgas pipelines Thus the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make And the strategy is resulting in some significant payoffs for the company Dukes thirdquarter earnings rose percent Duke attributed the higher results to the continued expansion of its unregulated energy businesses specifically naturalgas gathering and foreign energy sales Dukes shares which had been trading at week peaks are currently trading at as of the opening of the market on Nov Current market conditions certainly validate Dukes growth in this direction For starters current data indicate that natural gas is the fuel of choice for approximately percent of all new electric generation that is being built Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from trillion to trill ion cubic feet per year by In addition coal and nuclear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades at a time when naturalgas prices were comparatively low All of these factors have created a strong market for naturalgas generation despite the fact that data from the Department of Energy suggests a shortage of natural gas and heating oil for this winter Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market so this purchase could facilitate easier expansion in the state About a year ago the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach However the states three IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court arguing that merch ant plants were not allowed under state law The Florida Supreme Court overturn ed the decision of the state PSC blocking Dukes entry into the state Consequently Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another way to get into the Florida market and one that is potentially more profitable Florida has not yet passed restructuring legislation and it is unclear when the state will become competitive Bills have been introduced into the state legislature but thorny issues such as stranded cost recovery and unbundling charges have caused the bills to be removed Presently Governor Jeb Bush has created a member commission to develop an energy plan for the state The commission must submit a report to the governor and the legislature by December Among the issues that must be addressed are power reliability energy supply and delivery and the fiscal impacts of deregulation However it is clear from the commissions deadlin e that competition will not take effect in Florida during Yet looking forward if the California experience is any indication the naturalgas shortage should work to Dukes advantage As wholesale prices skyrocketed this summer Duke and other generators were in a prime position to reap large gains Duke is still following this tactic on the West Coast California regulators just gave approval to the construction of a proposed MW unit in Monterey County which again is naturalgas fired combine d cycle unit If California history repeats itself in Florida Duke and Willi ams will be the coowners of the only new gas pipeline coming into the state at a time when naturalgas supplies remain quite low DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November PGE Corp Pursues Multiple Generation Projections Looks Outside of California for Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD PGE Corp NYSE PCG announced that it will acquire a MW wind power generating station near Palm Springs Calif to supply electricity to the Western power grid PGE subsidiary National Energy Group is purchasing the plant from Seawest Wind Power Inc a San Diegobased developer of wind energy plants PGE expects the plant to enter commercial operation in the spring of ANALYSIS This is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom for PGE Corp Just over the last two months PGE Corp also has announced several other generation projects both within California and in other strategic areas of the country National Energy Group NEGPGE Corps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New Englandis spearheading all of the new generation projects PGE Corp claims that its goal is for NEG to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by Thus the accelerate d increase of megawatts under the NEG banner certainly is working toward that goal Lets take a quick look at the other generation projects that PGE Corp has announced in addition to the Palm Springs wind power facility Just last week NEG announced a longterm tolling agreement with Southaven Power an affiliate of Cogentrix Energy Under terms of the agreement NEGs subsidiary PGE Energy Trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced at an MW naturalgas fueled combined cycle located in Mississippi just south of the Tennessee border near Memphis The deal is noteworthy because it positions NEG close to the existing TVA and Entergy electric substations that will deliver the plants electricity into the regions transmission grid This announcement followed other substantial projects in Southern Californi a and Oregon The MW Otay Mesa Generating Project located in San Diego County is in the final stages of plant siting The project represents the first new power plant built in San Diego County in almost three decades and of course will become operational during a time when low supplies in California continue to drive up prices In Oregon NEG has just submitte d an application to build a new plant in Hermiston Ore adjacent to an alreadyexisting MW plant that NEG coowns with PacifiCorp The propose d Umatilla Generating Project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine that will burn natural gas with its fuel supply transported via the NEGs Pacific Northwest naturalgas pipeline The growth of NEG is a real success for PGE Corp at a time when its regulated subsidiary is struggling PGE Company the utility that provides natural gas and electric service to approximately million people in Northern and Central California has accumulated about billion in debt PGE Co buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal e market but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the company has little control over the rates it can charge customers Thus over the course of last summer PGE Co was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour PGE remains embroiled in negotiations with the CPUC over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt While the regulated PGE Co could find itself wallowing in the red dependi ng on regulatory rulings NEG has soared In the Q of PGE Corp report ed second quarter earnings from operations of per share on a diluted basis or million which represented a percent over diluted earning s from operations in the same quarter in Much of this success can be attributed to NEG which reported Q earnings of million which reflect ed a percent profit increase from the previous years quarter The winning streak continued into Q in which PGE Corp reported diluted earnings from operations at per share or million and revenues of billion compared with third quarter revenues of billion This constituted a percent increase in profit for the parent company Again NEG performed very well NEG contributions rose with diluted earnings from operations of per share or million on revenues of billi on Clearly PGE Corp has benefited greatly from NEGs ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside of the regulated California market Thus it is no wonder that although PGE Corp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated In addition the plant siting process in California historically has been quite restrictive and lengthy which also may explain why PGE Corp has chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state The siting process in California shows signs of becoming more facile In fact just yesterday the California Energy Commission adopted emergency regulations to implement the states new sixmonth power plant licensing process The new regulations allow for environmentally advanced power plantssuch as PGEs wind power plant in Palm Springsto be licensed and come online more quickly in California Currently PGE Corp has ownership and arrangement interests in more than plants the bulk of which are managed by NEG The companys generation portfolio currently consists of MW and more than MW in new power plant development and construction is in production As PGE Corp continues to expand its generation base it probably realizes that current industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least MW in order to be a formidable player By comparison a company like AEP clearly one the top generation companies in the industryhas a worldwide generat ing capacity of MW As NEG is PGEs primary growth vehicle at the prese nt time I think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced by this subsidiary Some questions remain Will PGE Corp split its unregulated and regulated operations into two standalone companies as other utilities such as AEP and Reliant have recently announced I checked with my sources at PGE Corp and the official company position is that there are no plans to restructure in this way at this time However PGE Corp does acknowledge the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for its regulated companys debt while showing a percent profit increase from its unregulated business Also what are the prospects for PGE Corps hydroelectric system Accordi ng to prior agreements PGE Corp was supposed to sell its MW hydroelectric system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in Septem ber However just last August PGE Corp petitioned the CPUC to halt this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold from the regulated PGE Co to an asofyetunformed unregulated subsidiary for billion PGE Corps motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou s the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale of hydropower at market prices In addition according to a Sept report from Dow Jones Newswires assuming a book value of about million for the hydroelectric system PGE Corp could take the remaining billion to pay off the transition debts incurred by PGE Co The CPUC and PGE Corp continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system and whether or not PGE Corp should be allowed to sell the assets to an unregulated company While this debate rages on NEG is free to continue along its aggressive growth mode DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

most popular competitive tools including the Mergers and Acquisitions Telecommunications and ECommerce InfoGrids at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to be built according to a new report from Financial Times Energy The additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through but also includes Finland France Germany Sweden and the United Kingdom At the same time concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being exacerbated by Germanys plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power ANALYSIS If FT Energys projections for necessary generation additions in Europe are accurate I think there are some real challenges that the Continent will face in reaching this goal First off for perspective lets be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming Europe will need by The figure of MW is roughly equivalent to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system in Texas When we consider also that the United States consumes about double the amount of power that Europe consumes the projection that Europe will need an additional MW of new generating capacity is a staggering proposition Granted like other developed areas of the world Europes energy consumption has grown over the last two years According to data included in its report FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from terrawatthours TWh in to TWh in an increase of about percent per year While this may seem like a minimal increase it is important to note that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average For instance estimated new capacity additions through are mainly concentrated in Spain France Germany and Sweden The growth in demand coupled with market liberalization has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction or purchase of generation assets Although reportedly percent of the electricity market across Europe has been liberalized to date the Continent remains rather disjointed as it is composed of national markets that are all approaching privatization at different speeds The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their privatization movements in the early s Spain required its stateowned utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February a process that will continue through Germany decided to open percent of its market all at once in April And France resisted efforts to privatize and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European Union Consequently although Europe may in fact need the MW of new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected the type and extent to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on the energy policy of each independent nation A variety of restrictions may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount of capacity Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization and by extension its approach to generation development I cant examine the policy of each country in this forum but I think a look at Germany is warranted both because it is a major component of Europes total energy market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact the Continent as a whole Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened to competition It follows that generation coming from Germany should contribute a large percentage of the Continents future power needs However a large percentage of Germanys power has come from nuclear power but that has all changed over the last year After the Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party nuclear energy became an unacceptable energy source The German government has essentially put a moratorium on nuclear power and in fact decided to eventually shut down nuclear power plants in the country Just last month Germanys two largest power producers RWE AG and EON AG announced plans to cut output from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has developed since Germany liberalized its market The measures amount to a reduction of about percent in Germanys overall power generating capacity Moreover nuclear energy has generated over onethird of Germanys nearly billion kilowatthours of annual electricity demand and onethird of Western Europes total electricity supply As the future of nuclear power in Germany looks rather dim big questions surround what will replace nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europes energy industry Coal currently produces about percent of the power generation in Germany but as a result of the countrys attempts to lower emissions coal also appears to be on a decline Also in Germany as in the rest of Europe coalindustry subsidies will come to an end as early as making it less economical to invest in coalfired plants At the same time other countries like France are exploring cleancoal technologies but it is questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand across the Continent Generally natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will take the place of nuclear power in Europe given the seemingly abundant supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea However as demand across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases this may impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe In addition there are no effective rules across Europe for thirdparty access to private pipeline grids also putting into question the future of naturalgas supplies Also as we have seen in the United States as demand for natural gas increases so will the prices which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary power source As a result much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable energy In fact the German government wants to double renewable energy output to percent of total energy demand by using such forms as hydroelectric and wind power This seems consistent with what the rest of Europe is doing The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate percent of its electricity from renewable resources by Scandinavian countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and lowemission forms of energy with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of the Nordic regions total electricity production Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western Europe with projects in Germany Denmark and Spain ranking among the fastestgrowing in the world Again according to the US DOE wind power is projected to grow by percent per year in Western Europe This growth prospective is pretty dismal and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe Renewable energy works fine when planning overall energy needs but it rarely can be relied on to meet peak demand The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to and the sun shines when it wants to which can make peak planning based on renewable energy difficult if not impossible This being the case many critics say Europes current move toward renewable energy is completely unrealistic arguing that it would take nearly wind turbines to equal one nuclear plant In addition the growth for renewable energy is plotted over the course of ten to fifteen years FT Energy marks the year as the point at which Europe will need the additional MW of generating capacity In addition despite the fact that coalfired generation poses pollution problems it is still a comparatively lowcost form of generation This will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence of a strong worldwide commitment The US Department of Energy projects only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy through just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain a slim percent share of the total world energy consumption So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs First keep in mind that Ive focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role in Europe as a whole However the restrictions on nuclear power are not necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries For instance the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by opening a plant in Temelin The question is without Germanys contribution of nuclear power will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other power sources and other countries Although the MW goal seems very ambitious Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use of merchant plants As competition continues wholesale power buyers are demanding shorterterm contracts which in turn is supporting a growing trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent Presently only the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power but there are signs that the trend is extending to Italy Spain the Netherlands and even Germany In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear power merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europes naturalgas market Yet as we have seen in California the plant siting process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles and it is not clear if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries Plus the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily naturalgas fired which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source Moreover just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter due to our own brand of energy supply problems we are finding that the problem is not limited to our part of the world It is of course unknown if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of MW by Yet at the same time it is clear that demand on the Continent continues to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at webrciwebnsfwebDeptsIAhtml SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we

article Bright Lights A Conversation With Kevin Jordan President of Excel Energy Technologies Ltd at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml SCIENTECH IssueAlert November SmartEnergy Rounds Up million in Financing Is an IPO in the Works By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities venture capital and global banks SmartEnergy a privately held Internetbased energy service provider active in New York plans to use the funding as working capital to rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment schedule ANALYSIS You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago IssueAlert Oct when I drew attention to the fact that the online startup was taking customers away from ConEdison In existence only since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers Under a promotion currently under way in New York SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to percent on energy through the winter months for naturalgas customers in the boroughs of New York City and Westchester County Capitalizing on ongoing threats about low supplies of oil and natural gas SmartEnergy is using the socalled energy crisis to lure customers away from the traditional utility by locking in current naturalgas rates over the course of the next months under its Smart Fixed Rate plan As a policy SmartEnergy hedges the products that its sell to customers so that neither the company nor its customers is exposed to energy market price risks In addition SmartEnergy has offered United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement to secure customers As I discussed last month an advantage that online energy providers such as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers In addition operating online allows SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets Up until now SmartEnergys marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York state However the company claims that it will be serving six states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the end of this year SmartEnergy expects to be serving all deregulated states by the end of and the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support this anticipated growth Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns as the energy industry continues to become deregulated Investors that are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy WPS Resources Corporation Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors In addition there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round including Dexia Ventures the private equity arm of Dexia Bank a USD billion asset bank based in Belgium KBC Bank and venture capitalist groups Trust Capital Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures The inclusion of both American and European investors is important Coupled with SmartEnergys intention to operate in all US states that are deregulating the fact that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic The fact that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform of worldwide service In fact Alliant Energy identified the strong growth of the Internet and technology in the energy segment as a key reason why it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy In fact the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison Wisbased Alliant has been in existence for several months The utilitys nonregulated subsidiary Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy to expand a decidedly efocused business The partnership with SmartEnergy represents Alliants new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies offering stateoftheart technology and new products and services for customers In fact Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as the energy company of today and tomorrow and believes that it has a platform that can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world Of course my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy It would certainly be an obvious move for the private company to head in this direction especially now as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street Ive written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like Evergreen Solar Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid IPOs as a result of in my opinion their business models in new technologies and or alternative fuels There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years With few exceptions energy companies exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several months have performed comparatively well As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid startup companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer service again resulting from its online presence Customer interaction can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet enabling account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at any time The downside of course is customer reluctance to sign up with a startup company that they may not know In addition SmartEnergy faces tough competition from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in deregulated markets including Utilitycom and Essentialcom None of these companies has yet gone public and are instead focusing on building critical mass and establishing their brand identities Yet of the three SmartEnergy may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion and could be on

ecommerce has revolutionized commodity trading the AD process and procurement within the energy industry With heavyweight keynotes and indepth panel discussions this is the first event to bring the major energy companies net markets venture capitalists regulatory bodies investment banks and analysts together to thrash out why its not business as usual but business online For more information please visit wwweyeforenergycomxonline SCIENTECH IssueAlert November The New Power Company Going Green While Stock Price Drops By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The New Power Company TNPC NYSE NPW which bills itself as the first national residential and small business energy provider announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy Inc to provide windgenerated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area Under the terms of the agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of ANALYSIS This is an interesting development especially considering that TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from PECO Energy This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain On the other hand it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company founded earlier this year by Enron along with partners AOL and IBM As you may recall just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply competitive default service for approximately of PECOs residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement arguing that the PECOTNPC agreement is not in the public interest and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question Thus it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services Up to this point TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers such as the approximately natural gas and electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group The acquisition of the customers in PECOs territory was a major coup for TNPC which is still in startup mode Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy Community Energy the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatthours allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power Interestingly the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about MW of green power to aggregated state agencies This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio Thus while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPCs original business plan the company appears to be moving in this direction at least in states where it is strategic to do so However this announcement comes on the heels of TNPCs announcement of its thirdquarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price TNPCs revenues for Q were million derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states Pennsylvania and New Jersey Gross profit was million or percent of revenues Yet the loss on earnings before income tax EBIT was million The net loss for the quarter was million or per basic share TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history Therefore the company contends that its yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance The companys goal for Q is to achieve revenues of approximately to million with an estimated yearend customer count of Eugene Lockhart TNPCs CEO said he was pleased with the Q performance Lockhart contends that TNPC achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives and referenced the fact that the company is still building its systems and architecture so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets In addition TNPC has raised approximately million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation However despite its positive outlook after TNPC made its earnings announcement its shares took a nosedive perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy providers ability to meet its objectives The shares closed last Friday at which is a dramatic drop from the average price of before the Q earnings announcement TNPC issued its IPO on Oct at a price of per share which at the time seemed quite high for a startup energy company with a limited track record A day after its opening the stock closed at per share The stock was received so favorably for two reasons in my estimation First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners among others put up about million in startup capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner of TNPC with percent control Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over customers Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock and the company is at a crossroads In order to keep its momentum on track TNPC needs to do two things First it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states Second as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors Consequently it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven Regarding the customer base expansion Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target Just last week the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state Yet its clear that TNPC is still finetuning its marketing approach In Ohio it is offering customers competitive energy prices flexible payment and pricing choices and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive but there is no mention in TNPCs application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio Moreover several questions remain Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC Will TNPC demonstrate revenues of million in Q And where will the companys next acquisition of customers take place All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC Miss last week Catch up on

more about SCIENTECHs Mergers Acquisitions and Convergence in the US Electric Industry InfoGrid at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM announced yesterday that it intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka Kansas based Western Resources WR in a taxfree stockforstock transaction The deal will require that WR separate its nonutility assets from its regulated utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders ANALYSIS In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry strategic combinations are becoming more commonplace This announcement took me by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of merger WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp United by attempting to acquire KCPL in At the time WR share price was above In WR share price soared to record highs of more than WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed They sold their interest in ADT for a million profit This profit masked a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the time was cutting WR rates by million reducing earnings by cents per share WR who obviously had a strategic focus on security used the profits from the ADT sale to purchase percent of Protection One one of the fastest growing companies in the monitored security business Protection One hit some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result their stock tumbled WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be favorable to them As a result some moved their money out of WR and by WR share price had tumbled to to In January of this year KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off the merger WR immediately split itself into two organizations regulated utility operations and nonregulated business with the intent of finding a buyer for the regulated utility operations WR claimed in June of this year that companies were being courted including international companies for the utility operations assets of Kansas Power Light KPL and Kansas Gas and Electric KGE Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me But it does fit SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba CEO of PNM just weeks ago and asked if the development of alliances mergers and acquisitions were a part of the positive approach to PNMs strategy Jeff answered Very definitely Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business and that can bring a sustainable competitive advantage are essential for us in this industry The criticality of market channels cant be overemphasized Once you have a good market channel that doesnt mean that everything you put through that market channel you have to do yourself or you have to own You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances There are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves something that is core to your business So both alliances and acquisitions will be a part of PNMs future Just weeks later PNM is buying WR Utilizing my rear view mirror now I see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM They both operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix including nuclear They both have multicommodity in electric and gas They both have wholesale operations PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part to a strong wholesale operation PNM net earnings for the nine months ended Sept totaled million or per share diluted on total operating revenues of billion compared to earnings of million or per share in the first three quarters of PNM has adopted a niche strategy in the wholesale power market by developing tailored wholesale power products for its customers While some of the megatraders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard commodity PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according to the needs of the buyer PNM has found success in this niche segment of a large wholesale market The merger deal is expected to take between and months to complete PNM will inherit approximately billion in debt making the total value of the deal worth billion Fitch has placed its securities ratings of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving Fitch plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact of the merger Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist between Wichita and Topeka This may result in a rate case It should also be noted that Wichita Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover municipalize the electric system from Western Resources within its city limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka Wichita has about power customers roughly a fourth of all the customers served by Western Resources They represent more than million of KGEs million in revenues PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has demonstrated its ability to do so PNM has decreased its debttocapital ratio from percent to less than percent in the last seven years The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque NM and the chairman president and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba Search SCIENTECHs PowerHitter archive to read about our

Energy Issues By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD After a tumultuous Election Day full of constant changes in the projections the identity of the next president of the United States was still unknown as of Wednesday morning Nov The identity of the next US president will be determined by a vote recount in Florida which must be completed by the close of business Thursday state election officials said Tuesdays national vote count is so close as is the number of electoral votes won by GOP candidate George W Bush and Democrat Vice President Al Gore that the presidential election is too close to call It is also possible that one candidate could win the Electoral College vote and the other win the popular vote which hasnt happened in a hundred years ANALYSIS Well it certainly has been a historymaking Election Day I was prepared to analyze the future of the energy industry based on which presidential candidate had been elected yesterday As the candidates have such polarized platforms with regard to energy issues it is not an overestimation to say that many critical energy issues hinge on this election As we await the final and accurate announcement of who is the next US president which may not come for another day or so it is a good time to review how each candidate intends to address low domestic supplies of oil and natural gas the status of deregulation the development of renewable energy and the high cost of energy due to recent price spikes Throughout the campaign Bush criticized the ClintonGore Administration for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Rather than developing an effective energy policy Bush accused Gore of raising gasoline taxes discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas and failing to anticipate the oil and naturalgas price spikes that have occurred this year Bush also was very critical of President Clintons decision to tap into the Strategic Reserve Fund in September and release million barrels of crude oil from the nations emergency oil stockpile As the United States now enters a socalled energy crisis brought about primarily as a result of rising demand and diminishing supplies Bush has outlined an energy policy that includes more than initiatives I cant address all of them but have identified the key policies that will likely unfold under a Bush administration Perhaps the best summary of Bushs energy policy is that he supports a comprehensive approach to ensuring US energy security and intends to accomplish this by expanding domestic resources using a range of fuels and technologies supporting ongoing deregulation of the industry and providing energy assistance to lowincome households Reduce American dependence on foreign supplies of oil Bush repeatedly made the case that since US energy demand has more than doubled far outstripping domestic production Today the United States consumes approximately onethird of the worlds energy and approximately percent of our usage comes from foreign sources Bush contends that US dependence on foreign oil has increased from percent in to percent today and that oil imports are projected to increase to million barrels per day by To remedy this Bush supports the development of domestic sources for oil natural gas and renewable energy Specifically Bush has proposed opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to environmentally responsible and regulated exploration with the intent of replacing the oil that the United States now imports from Iraq Regarding natural gas Bush will examine whether certain promising naturalgas reserves in federal lands should be opened for exploration Yet its important to note that Bush is not suggesting that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will be sufficient Rather he recognizes that access to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States and the global economy However instead of relying predominantly on Iraq especially as Saddam Hussein threatens to reduce productionBush will work more clo sely with Canada and Mexico to increase crossborder flows of oil natural gas and electricity within North America Support new pipeline construction As domestic production of oil and natura l gas increases to meet growing demand Bush also supports the construction of new pipelines and would expand refining capacity by tearing down regulatory hurdles Bush has referenced the National Petroleum Councils estimates that the gas industry will require miles of new transmission pipelin es and miles of distribution lines by Bush sees a need for new pipelines and distribution lines in the Midwest in particular where traditional coal plants should ultimately be replaced by gasfired plants Support the growth of renewable energy Bush supports the development of renewable and lowemission fuels and has committed to investing billion over years to fund cleancoal technologies and billion over years to help utilities purchase nuclear plants At the same time Bush will propose legislation requiring utilities to reduce harmful emissions from their generation plants and offer tax credits for power produced from alternative or renewable fuels However Bush recognizes that while renewable energy is important it currently accounts for less than percen t of the total US energy consumption Consequently for the foreseeable future Bush contends that hydrocarbonsoil coal and natural gaswil l continue to play the primary role in meeting the growing energy needs of Americans Support electric deregulation Bush supports deregulation of the energy industry and prefers to let markets and not government officialsdeter mine investment decisions and give customers a choice of suppliers Toward this end Bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed to assure the reliability of the nations electrical grid and to promote consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition While he supports consumer choice Bush recognizes that often lowincome families face high electricity prices as was found in San Diego this summer Consequently Bush supports the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP the largest direct expenditure energy subsidy program which has about million left in funding to support emergency funding for cooling and heatin g assistance In addition Bush will expand the Weatherization Assistance Program which supports about homes by spending billion for Weatherization programs over the next ten years As noted the presidential candidates are proposing very different platform s with regard to the energy industry Thus it is not surprising that Vice President Gore disagrees with most everything that Governor Bush is proposi ng Essentially the most striking difference comes down to conservation While Bush supports the exploration of domestic fuels Gore believes the United States should focus on doing more with what we already have and protecting the environment for future generations Of course Gore carries the legacy of his ClintonGore administration one that as noted has been criticized by Bush for not developing a comprehensive energy policy Thus it is not completely clear how Gore would depart from what has been his administrations approach to energy issues over the last seven years It is likely that Gores administration would follow much the same path that the Clinton administration traveled although Gore certainly has made the environment one of his core platforms for example his book Earth in the Balance Thus is not surprising that creating a clean environment and stable climate is one of the key foundations on which Gore has established his energy platform Beyond that Gore has said that his new energy policy will focus on five goals Saving energy reducing pollution promoting a higher standard of living and creating highwage jobs Reducing the nations dependence on unreliable imported oil Protecting children against the threat of pollution nationally and globally Dramatically reducing the threat posed by global warming Curtailing brownouts by increasing the reliability of the power grid Perhaps the central initiative that Gore has proposed is the creation of the National Energy Security and Environmental Trust Fund Designed to bring revolutionary change to our transportation and energy infrastructure the Fund would help consumers purchase energyefficient vehicles homes and appliances promote clean and reliable sources of electric power and encourage longterm solutions to reduce US dependence on imported sources of oil Gore would provide consumers with a tax credit up to to purchase energyefficient new homes or up to a credit to upgrade the efficiency of their current homes Gore also supports expanding the current percent tax credit provided to homes or businesses that use solar energy to generate electricity or heat water Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the Unite d States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell save a million barrels of oil a day which is exactl y what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to deve lop fuel cells alternative energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve Gore supports tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund as Preside nt Clinton did in September to increase oil supplies prevent winter shortage s of home heating oil and stabilize oil prices Perhaps the only issue on which the two candidates agree is deregulation of the energy industry as a whole This process is of course occurring on a statebystate basis although many states have begun to resist competition due to current low prices in their states and fear of sudden price spikes as occurred in California this summer Bush clearly supports a national restructuring law while it unclear if Gore supports this as well or prefe rs to let states continue to deregulate on their own or opt out from this process One thing is clear in all of this uncertainty The future of the energy industry hangs in the balance and will continue in one of two drastically different directions as the final outcome of this election is determined As supply and demand issues continue to generate concern across the country it is certain that energy issues will remain on the radar of whichever candidate is elected president DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance or Lack Thereof of Information Technology in the Energy Industry By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the CEO Mega Panel View From the Top at the th annual EEIAGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc e in Phoenix this week The moderator was Charles Bayless former chairman president and CEO of Illinova The remaining three CEOs included Keith Stamm CEO Aquila Energy Dr Matthew Cordaro president and CEO Midwest ISO and James Pignatelli chairman president and CEO UniSource Energy ANALYSIS This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner The conference organizers did a good job in getting a crosssection of the energy industry in transition The trading organization specialist was represented with Aquila the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes t ISO and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource Energy Each panelist was asked what role information technology IT played in their respective organization Their answers may surprise you Dr Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first Dr Cordaro stressed that IT was very critical to the operation of an ISO saying it is essentially the foundation of the ISO He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions every week in a realtime operation Among the responsibilities that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are monitoring the congestion on the grid and taking appropriate action preventing gaming through market monitoring settlement processing who owes who what and handling the dispute process The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati on RTO Alliance on July of this year to deliver an integrated control center system ICCS that when complete will provide million in infrastructure for the MISO The RTO Alliance which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation of Seattle Open Access Technology International OATI of Minneapolis Perot Systems of Dallas Texas and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City Utah will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission The hardware and software in the ICCS project will support MISOs operational functions including transmission planning reservation scheduling realtime monitor ing and control settlement and billing Dr Cordaro also stated that Lodestar was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to ATT Solutions Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next Keith began by clarifying Aquilas focus as trading owning very little assets in a highvolume lowmargin highvolatility business IT is very important in the trading business Realtime information must be known and disseminated appropriately to the right individuals Keith believes that one of Aquilas strategic asset s and strengths is its risk management system Aquila strives for a realtim e calculation of risk Aquila Energy a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc has been a surprisin g winner in the trading marketplace this year showing a percent growth since last year with billion total revenue for the past six months of that million in trading revenue compared to million in The EBIT was million vs million a year ago Aquila has gathered top traders and intellectual financial and risk management personnel to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies including top traders AEP and Duke Energy as an investment step Aquila perceived was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin g platforms The Energy Trading Consortium Duke Energy AEP Aquila Energy Reliant Energy Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy is in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap benefits from the transaction cost liquidity volume and speed of exchange This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to onetomany Another competitor recently launched is eSpeeds TradeSpark James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial statements concerning information technology James stated that IT in the vertically integrated utility is not strategic at least not at the present time James believes that IT will become strategic someday in the deregulated market James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the IT arena He mentioned pulling in his IT folks and saying Lets switch the distribution network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances well switch back to AC While James comments may have been controversial with the more than attendees and approximately energy CIOs in the audienc e he does have a point The vertically integrated utilitys core strength is to generate power and distribute it to captive customers reliably While some IT systems like outage management and SCADA devices may be strategic in this sense the other parts of IT are questionable and could be candidates for outsourcing James claims to be working on BB and BC initiatives at the moment His vision for BC is a smart chip in the residence that has access to instantaneous pricing information The residence will buy electricity for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce load thereby reducing the TD utility to a simple conduit for service James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior to its sale to AES In Tucson Electric invested million in NEV and Charles Bayless then Tucson Electrics chairman president and chief executive officer and James Pignatelli Tucson Electrics senior vice president and chief operating officer served on New Energy Ventures administrative committee It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated IT systems If one were to stop and think about it deregulation could not occur without the complex IT systems that are employed today in the marketplace I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have thought about an unbundled electric marketplace It is in fact undoing their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational efficiency DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD See SCIENTECHs

stable the stock price should go down and not up Ill provide one theory but first lets establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about The companys sales since have been composed primarily of solar panels Evergreen plans to begin largescale manufacturing of its solar power products in a new manufacturing facility in early a growth strategy that the IPO proceeds obviously would support Evergreens principal objective is to become a leading producer of highquality solar power products primarily for the ongrid market and the offgrid rural electrification market What makes the company unique according to Evergreen is its String Ribbon technology which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon which is required for most solarpower technologies Evergreens String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half which reduces manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability In December Evergreen Solar formed a fiveyear strategic distribution and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market Essentially Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively through Kawasaki In fact the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreens business In the first six months of sales to Kawasaki accounted for approximately percent of Evergreens product revenues After the IPO Kawasaki will have an percent stake in Evergreen The risks associated with Evergreens business are formidable and the company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly revenue continues to be disappointing Beyond that Evergreens success hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market which is still in question Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies pointofuse electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the electric grid will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the global electric power market and within DG technologies solar power has experienced significant growth over the last years In addition solar power produces zero emissions and may grow as a result of renewable energy requirements in various states This may be true but at the same time there are other competing DG technologies such as fuel cells microturbines and wind power which may slow the grow of solar power Plus theres little proof that Evergreens String Ribbon technology will produce significant costsavings to make it a standout technology There are other risks as well not the least of which is the exclusive relationship with Kawasaki If the relationship goes sour this could dramatically diminish Evergreens potential revenues and market share So with this market profile the question of why Evergreen had such a strong IPO still remains I think the answer is that Evergreens business focus is exclusively placed on alternative power At a time when ecommerce stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success stocks based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that distributed generation technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years Commercial and industrial customers want various options that can reduce their dependence on the grid With regard to alternative fuels and distributed generation technologies investors may believe that either utilities or large endusers will begin to develop these technologies as deregulation continues Remember Active Power Nasdaq ACPW whose shares soared on expectations that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology On its opening day in August Active Power stock increased by percent from the opening price of to Although Active Powers stock price has bounced around since then it still closed at on Nov a very respectable level and approximately percent above its original price Another example is Capstone Turbine Nasdaq CPST which is currently trading at after opening at in June Along with alternative fuels venture capitalists also appear to be responding to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services to energy companies Then there is the growing market of exchanges such as Pantellos Enporion Enermetrix and the like which could be the next big round of successful IPOs The longterm question is how long such stocks can continue to open so successfully without having a strong financial performance to support the opening Ecommerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two ago but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded to see the money Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following a similar path which makes time a critical factor The bottom line is that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial climate remains strong Hear JON BROCK Director of Strategic and Competitive Intelligence SCIENTECHRCI address the ramifications of legislative and regulatory requirements on your Information

Take on Challenges Opportunities of Being Wirecoms at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Enron Offers to Buy Out Azurix By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Enron Corp announced that it has offered up to million in funding to take Azurix Corp NYSE AZX private at a buyout price of per share Enron owns directly and indirectly about percent of Azurix a global water company that owns operates and manages water and wastewater assets and provides related services The specific structure and timing of Enrons proposal has yet to be determined but the companys board is now consideri ng the proposal ANALYSIS Azurix has been plagued with operational and financial problems over the last months culminating in the departure of its former CEO Rebecca Mark in late August Enron had established Azurix in July with a billion acquisition of Britains Wessex Water which provides water and wastewater services to a UK population of approximately million Operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America Argentina and Brazil Azurix was intended to be Enrons vehicle to capitalize on what it perceived to be favorable market conditions for water investments Yet Azurix has not been a profitable operation for Enron and has been seen as a real anomaly when compared against Enrons consistent success in its other ventures for example EnronOnline For instance Azurix reported yearend net income of million significantly under projections for what Enron had hoped for the subsidiary After months of speculation Mark stepped down both as Azurix CEO and from the Enron board of directors and was replaced by John Garrison Jr Mark maintained throughout her tenur e as CEO of Azurix that the company needed time to develop core assets and capabilities However this approach was in stark contrast to Enrons guidi ng philosophyas espoused by COO Jeffrey Skillingwhich has moved the co mpany away from owning hard assets Skilling also believed that although acquiri ng the Wessex operation gave Azurix the engineering capability and industry knowledge to participate in the water business privatization of the water industry has slowed down considerably since the company began to penetrate this market Instead of pursuing a capitalintensive strategy for Azurix Skilling wanted Azurix to become more of a serviceoriented business This change in business direction coincided with the departure of Mark Yet Azurix has continued to flounder even since Mark left In the third quarter of this year Enron reportedly lost million in its corporate and other category and attributed a fourth of the loss to the Azurix operation Azurixs stock price started a marked decline in early August when it was announced that annual results would not meet analysts expectations While Azurix was taken public in June at a price of per share it curren tly is priced at at close of the markets on Oct This is an approximately increase from what Azurix had been trading at recently presumably due to Enrons announcement of the proposed buyout Enrons buyout offer comes after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix Reportedly three out of the four potenti al buyers were unwilling to pay more than per share although one of the buyers initially considered an offer of per share but ultimately decide d against the purchase Enrons motivation in returning Azurix to a private status is probably one of protecting its shareholders Enron pointed out in its announcement that shareholders would receive on a timely basis a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price of the shares at which Azurix has traded over the last several months Making matters worse for Enron a group of plaintiffs represented by New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian Feffer LLP have initiated a classaction lawsuit against Azurix in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas The plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all investors who purchased Azurix stock during the period of June the date of Azurixs IPO and Aug and who suffe red damages as a result The law firm is claiming that Azurix violated the Federal securities laws I placed a call to the law firm this morning in hopes of getting additional information about what the classaction suit entails Unfortunately I did not receive a call back before press time The consensus among the vast majority of US energy companies is that the profitability of water as a convergence strategy is questionable The most obvious negative about the water business is that it most likely will remain a heavily regulated delivery business offering few opportunities for private companies to penetrate the market Water is a very staid busine ss that seems inconsistent with Enrons aggressive growth strategy After Enron secures a fair return for Azurixs shareholders it is not clear what the company will do with its water subsidiary but I would not be surprised if Azurix is sold to another company However in Augustright before Marks departureAzurix announced that it had begun a pilot progr am in the Lower Rio Grande using its Internet exchange WaterWatercom The site will provide users with information price transparency and efficiency in water exchanges This announcement indicated that Azurix would begin trading water rights adding this commodity to the growing list of Enrons traded commodities energy telecom weather derivatives etc So it may be the case that Enron keeps Azurix but turns it into a water trading operation as opposed to water and wastewater services In any case the present objective for Enron will be financing the buyout and ensuring that Azurixs shareholders receive a significant premium to the market price of Azurix Enron also wants to ensure other benefits to Azurix including a significant nearterm reduction in Azurixs general and administrative expenses greater certainty to Azurixs customers and employees and increas ed flexibility for restructuring Azurixs

<30727536.1075842491012.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-30 02:35:00,SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

<31143808.1075842480273.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-12-11 02:55:00,San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PGE Get a complimentary premiere SourceBook Weekly Issue at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml Not just news analysis Miss last week Catch up on the latest analyses of the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Backers of a plan to create a publicly owned power system in San Francisco and Brisbane Calif got a financial boost recently with a panel approving in taxpayer money to study public power and related issues Most of the money will be used to study how the proposed municipality district would work and how it would be financed The Board of Supervisors Finance Committee approved the spending but put of the money on reserve pending the selection of contractors to perform the study and determine the scope of the work ANALYSIS This news item circulated about two weeks ago but it still deser ves attention as this could have tremendous impact on PGE The announcement of the municipalization study comes at arguably the worst possible time for PGE as the utility already faces a multitude of financial and public relations problems Yet in fact the issue has been developing for several months Back in July supporters of municipalization in PGEs service territory turned in a petition with signatures calling for the creat ion of a municipal utility district meaning that electric service would be provided by a city rather than an investorowned utility First let me provide some brief context regarding PGEs current condition The utility is in debt of over billion due to uncollected fees related to the price spikes of last summer PGEs objective is to bill its custome rs for this debt and toward that end has petitioned to raise its rates with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC Under PGEs plan average residential monthly bills reportedly would increase from about to on Jan Naturally consumer activist groups such as TURN that carefully monitor PGEs every move have contested the rate increase arguing that the utility alone is responsible for the debt it currently faces Since it is uncertain if the CPUC will grant PGEs petition speculation that the utility will become financially insolvent has begun to grow Both San Francisco and the smaller city of Brisbane to the south are includ ed in the study because municipalization must include two separate cities in order to take effect If municipalization is ultimately approved these two cities would form a new district and elect directors who would then attempt to purchase PGEs power grid in the area Proponents of the muni bypass effort say that the cities can provide less expensive power to customers than PGE as the utility must pay dividends to stockholders and compensate wellpaid executives PGE has already start ed damage control in response to the study arguing against the formation of a municipal utilities district First the utility has said simply that it is not for sale but more importantly it is PGEs contention that customers would not necessarily save money if the cities in question were to municipalize their electric districts In addition PGE says the cost for the cities to buy its assetsnecessary power plants utility lines and other infrastructurewould run about billion which in fact would make the project more expensive in the long run for customers Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield is spearheading the municipalization effort and is using the problems in San Diego as a means to support his case His name may sound familiar as Rosenfield has been involved in many seemingly antiinvestor owned utility IOU measures in California Back in Rosenfield led the fight for Proposition which would have essentially put a screeching halt on deregulation in the state Although Prop was ultimately defeated at the ballot had it passed the measure would have stopped the three California IOUs from charging customers for the costs associated with billion in bonds they had sold to pay for the percent rate cut that customers began receiving in January Prop would have blocked the utilities from recouping any of their stranded costs which of course SDGE has now accomplished and reportedly the other IOUs SCE and PGE are close to doing so as well Rosenfield was a key particip ant in Californians Against Utility Taxes CUT which lobbied repeatedly for electric rates to be reduced by percent for small consumers as opposed to the percent that was included in the states restructuring bill Along with this study related to specific cities there reportedly is a simultaneous movement from Governor Gray Davis for a state takeover of the power transmission grid power plants and governmentsponsored construction of new generating plants In early December an internal memo was leaked indicating that the governor was considering these measures as a response to the tight supplies and high prices seen in San Diego last summer Includ ed in the plan would be a restructuring of the states power system wherein the grid of transmission lines and power plants would be placed under state control Among several points on which PGE and the governor disagree Davis has proposed an extended rate freeze for customers of all of the three states IOUs While PGE is pushing for a rate increase Californias highest official reportedly would implement an indefinite rate freeze that would further complicate PGEs plan to pull itself out of debt Municipalization attempts in cities across the United States have increased over the last two decades Just last week the city of Hermiston Ore was granted the right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilit ies that Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The Umatilla County Circuit Court has upheld the city of Hermistons right to acquire by condemnation the distribution facilities Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality The city has been trying to acquire those facilities since with the intent of forming its own utility to serve the commercial and residential customers now served by Pacific Power Of course even though this is a significant ruling it will remain embroiled in court for some time A jury trial to set the dollar amount of compensation for Pacific Powers facilities wont start until March Other wellpublicized municipalization attempts have taken place in Lakewood NY failed and a number of cities across Florida However despite the rise in muni bypass efforts the fact remains that no contested municipalization effort of any significant size has been successful since the one that occurred in Massena NY back in At that time the city of Massena offered lowcost hydropower and taxfree financing which made the municipalization attempt beneficial to citizens Today cities rarely can offer such advantages which had made it difficult for muni bypass efforts to succeed Statistics show that when given the option to develop a cityrun electric system by dissolving the incumbent utilitys authority citizens across the country have chosen to retain the IOU model Of course arguments could be made that in such cases the IOU lobbying force has been a formidable component wielding the capital necessary to wage a successful campaign to protect its business Yet at the same time a case can be made that the benefits of municipalization just have not been proven and that explains why citizens generally have opted to retain the IOU model There is both good and bad news for PGE related to this particular study The bad news is that studies such as these most often recommend municipalization which makes it very difficult for local politicians to resist a takeover In other words because the wheels have started turning toward municipalization in the area it is more than likely that PGE will have to engage in a battle to preserve its business Even though past history shows the attempt probably would not be successful if PGE contests it the bypass effort would result in PGE spending a lot of money and time to fight the effort The good news is that time is on the utilitys side Municipalization is usually a long and involved process The fact that the Finance Committee gave the green light to proceed with the study is only the first in many regulatory checkpoints The next steps are the full boards consideration of the funding request for the study and subsequently a decision whether or not to put municipalization on the local ballot Then the hard campaigni ng would begin to sway public opinion one way or the other Thus even if muncipalization of the two cities were to occur PGE still has some time to potentially resolve its debt situation and construct a strong opposition to the muni attempt However from a public relations standpoint this is just the last thing that PGE needs at this point The utility continues to spin media coverage to convey that it is only trying to recoup a debt that it accrued on behalf of its obligation to serve customers Adversaries such as TURN and Harvey Rosenfield however are just as aggressively working to convince the publi c that PGE is trying to unfairly stick customers with a billion tab To now have discussions emerge about whether or not city government could more effectively provide electric service is another fire that PGE will have to extinguish if it wants to remain operational

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Allegheny Energy Solutions an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy Inc has added Siemens Solar Industries LP to its growing portfolio of suppliers for distributed generation products Through its new agreement with Siemens Solar Industries Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions called earthsafe v The systems are suited for industrial commercial an d residential applications The new partnership further advances Alleghenys strategy of becoming a national energy supplier ANALYSIS This partnership comes on the heels of Alleghenys recently announced agreement to purchase three gasfired merchant plants from Enron North America Both deals reaffirm Alleghenys intent to expand its geographic footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability In my opinion Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further ed very aggressive generation expansion plans this year announcing one acquisition or development after another The company has added seven new offices in the northeastern United States over the last year and has disclosed that it will open new offices in the Southeast in to begin preparing for the albeit slow move to competition in that region The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its service offerings Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens portfolio of companies specializing in high and medium voltage protection and substation control systems power and distribution transformers system planning and decentralized energy supply systems Siemens Solar claims to be the number one provider of solarpower solutions in the world having shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of MW The company has been in business for about years and reached a mileston e of MW in Thus the company has doubled its production output in just four years Siemens Solar offers an array of solarrelated products As noted Alleghen y Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemens earthsafe platform which accord ing to information on Siemens Website is offered in four models ranging in DC power from watts to watts The earthsafe system consists of solar modules universal roof mounting kits DCAC inverters and interconn ect hardware The intent is that businesses and residences would install the earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs the remainder supplied by more traditional means and contribute to the efforts of reduci ng emissions from fossil fuel plants Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that the addition of the Siemens product to its service offerings positions it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer a complete onsite power solution I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly diversifies the companys service offerings Although the jury is still out regarding the profitability of solar power along with other forms of distributed and renewable energy sources for Allegheny the move makes sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy solutions Allegheny Energy Supply where most of the generation expansion efforts of its parent are focused develops competitive generation solution s eg cogeneration green power etc for a variety of end users Within the last year Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving from a regional player into a national energy supplier resulting primarily from its success in the strong Northeast market This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation on the part of the unregulated company Earlier this year Allegheny Energy Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energys Mitchel l Power Station in New Eagle Pa Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent company This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine in the Northeast The diversification of Alleghenys generation arsenal is also important because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors Allegheny must surely know that companies like Dominion Reliant and AESjust to name a feware also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar eas across the country Thus by adding diverse power options to its service offerings Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its energy supply packages I observed several months ago that Allegheny was probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani es that are strong in generation This partnership with Siemens seems to indic ate that distributed generation including solar power could become that niche As a sidenote Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard Poors Index earlier this week So the announcement that the company is diversify ing into solar power comes at a time when as CEO Alan Noia puts it our stron g growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance have received recognition The SP Index is widely regarded as the standard for measuring largecapitalization US stock market performance As of yesterday Dec Allegheny Energys stock NYSE AYE was priced at The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens not Allegheny Energy Solutions Competition among companies that develop products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late and there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability of this market One direct competitor to Siemens that Ive tracked recently is Evergreen Solar a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts in half the required use of silicon which is needed for most solarpo wer technologies Evergreen Solar which recently became a publicly traded company has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and that it may never become a profitable company The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries so the compan y may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power units This is of course an issue for Siemens and not Allegheny to address Under its partnership with Siemens Allegheny attains all the

Nuclear Benefit By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD According to a Dec report in the Wall Street Journal naturalgas prices which already had been rising all year shot up percent to an alltime high of per million BTUs on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange Today reports are circulating that spot prices at the Southern California border reached an astounding on Wednesday breaking the Daily Gas Price Indexs alltime record high of The sharp increases are viewed as a reaction to cold weather in the Northeast and forecasts of more to come Projections continue to indicate that naturalgas customers will see sharp increases in their heating bills very soon The current increase has result ed from a volatile mixture of rising demand and decreased supplies for natural gas which has driven up prices by a total of percent or more than since a year ago The uncertain future of naturalgas supplies may be a contributing factor to an unexpected resurgence of interest in coalfi red and nuclear power ANALYSIS Unfortunately we are starting to see real evidence of the projec ted rise in naturalgas prices just as temperatures start to take their downwa rd slope across most of the United States Two months ago the Department of Energy predicted that households using natural gas would see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills with prices rising about percent on average Weve actually been seeing the price increase since June of this year when naturalgas hit a thenunprecedented mark of per million BTUs At that time it was a shock to see those kinds of spikes for natural gas especially since the energy source is typically used mostl y in the wintertime for heating Yet now as we move into the coldest months of the season I project that the alltimehighs of to per million BTUs are something that might become all too common for the near term The Wall Street Journal article on the price spikes also reported that the American Gas Association estimated that as of Nov there were about trillion cubic feet of gas in storage This represented an percent decrease from the fiveyear average for that date The United States is mostly selfreliant when it comes to naturalgas supplies and as Ive discussed in previous columns the fact that a reported percent of federal lands has been placed off limits for naturalgas drilling certai nly adds to the concern about future supplies The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibited drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground Yet at the same time substitute forms of power generation such as coal and nuclear have been restricted or downgraded in favor of natural gas which has only exacerbated the current demand on supply EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years Certainly the public resistance toward nuclear power has been well documented which has thwarted any plann ed production of a new nuclear plant Ironically it seems to me that we now find ourselves at a crossroads in this industry that may in fact lead to a resurgence of coalfired and nucle ar power Especially in states such as Texas and Oklahoma which are very reliant on naturalgas supplies the current uncertainty about the availability of natural gas and reasonable prices poses a major dilemma Despite the recent trend of moving away from these two forms of power I can point to several developments indicating that the current predicament could creat e a forced reliance on these power substitutes First lets look at coal Its been widely postulated that coal is cheaper and easier to produce than natural gas and its supplies are certainly more abundant As recently as this year coal has accounted for about percent of the electricity produced in the United States although that majorityhold over power production has come under attack Emission requirements have forced many generators to shut down or minimize the use of their coalfired generating stations In fact a group of seven utilitiesAEP Cinergy Illinois Power Southern Indiana Gas Electric Southern Company and Tampa Electric Companyhave been hit with a lawsuit by the EPA claiming that they contributed to some of the most severe environmental problems facing certain parts of the United States Specifically the EPA has claime d that the utilities violated the Clean Air Act with emissions from their coalfired power plants Currently while naturalgas prices have soared coal prices have remained comparatively low and stable In addition clean coal technologies are being put into place to reduce the amount of particulates released from coalfired plants As a result many generating companies are hedging their bets that the rise in natural gas prices will continue by maintaining or increasing their coalfired generation For example AEP is the nations leading consumer of coal Reportedly about percent of AEPs electric generation is made at coalfired plants In response to the naturalgas price spikes AEP confirmed that it will continue to operate all of its coalfired plants at full capacity despite the ongoing lawsuit from the EPA Proponents of coal are using the socalled natural gas crisis as an opportunity to argue that electricity from coal can be provided at about half the cost of other fossil fuels and is less costly and more reliable than intermitten t power sources such as wind and solar In addition coal proponents say that the cost of electricity would double if the United States were to replace all existing coalgenerated power plants with alternative forms of power Nuclear power also could stand to benefit from the comprised supplies and high prices of natural gas Following the growing interest among several European and Asian countries several US utilities have expressed recent interest in expanding their nuclear assets Corbin McNeill cohead of Exelon Corp on Monday stated that new nuclear plants are needed and one will definitely be built in the next five to years McNeill also noted that the question of whether a new nuclear plant was built would depend on a sustained increase in prices for natural gas which remains the curren t fuel of choice for new power plants However he rejected the notion that building new nuclear plants would require the Energy Departments Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository to be operational an event that probably wont happen until Entergy is another example of a company that continues to aggressively pursue nuclear power and may spark other companies to do the same in respon se to high naturalgas prices In late November Entergy announced that it would submit a counteroffer for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant which is already in the midst of being sold to rival buyer AmerGen Energy the joint venture between Exelon and British Energy Entergy which has been developing a strong nuclear platform for some time believes that the Northeastern United States offers a strong market potential for nuclear power and plans to increase its offer for the Yankee plant and trump AmerGens standing offer of million The next few months especially as temperatures continue to drop should be very telling on two counts First will we continue to see the recordbreaking prices for natural gas I say yes Second what impact will these price spikes have on coal and nuclear I think they should only have a positive impact on future development of these two forms of power However the question is whether or not new production of coal and nuclear can be put into place fast enough to minimize the potentially disastrous impact from the low supplies and resultant rising prices of natural gas Only time will have the answer to these questions

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December LADWP Continues to Shine Despite Californias Dark Period By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEShares in companies that make alternative energy technologies have climbed as a result of Californias latest round of statewide blackouts Shares in solar power producing companies in particular have embarked on a recent increase For instance Evergreen Solar Nasdaq ESLR recently jumped up about percent to be currently priced at representing an annual increase of percent Evergreens main competitor AstroPower Nasdaq APWR gained about percent and is currently priced at representing an annual increase of percent According to a report in Reuters James Logerfo an analyst with Bank of America Montgomery concluded that the increase is speculative buying across the energy industry Some are buying without appreciating how far away these companies are from having real products and some are building for a trade this summer They are not buying to hold the stocks for five years but for five months or five weeks Analysis Regardless of the prospectus for solar power stocks it certainly appears that solar power in general is finding a new niche as a direct result of compromised supplies of more traditional fuel sources such as natural gas Renewed interest from investors in solar power is probably a direct result of concerns about existing power supply in a handful of Western states However at the same time solar power companies such as Evergreen Solar and AstroPower also are turning in strong profits for Q which represents a positive turnaround for both companies The combination of strong investor interest and an upswing in profits indicates that solar power could be embarking on a market boom that up to only a few years ago was seen as very unlikely The question is whether the turnaround will be temporary or if solar power companies truly have found a permanent place in the sun Companies involved in solar energy typically have a business model that is founded on the technology of photovoltaics which is basically the process of absorbing photons from the sun or other light sources and turning them into electrons According to recent reports demand for solar cells grew by percent in Questions about the reliability of power supply provided by traditional utilities that have been sparked by the California situation presumably will only result in greater interest Consequently those companies that have been on the forefront of solar power research and development for years are now starting to reap the benefits of their efforts Recent financial reports seem to support this theory For instance Evergreen Solarwhich develops manufactures and markets solar power products based on its patented String Ribbon technologyreported product revenues of an increase of percent when compared to revenues of for the same period in Granted the company absorbed a net loss for Q of million as compared with a net loss of for Q However Evergreen remains pleased by its most recent financial performance which it attributes to geographic diversification and growing market opportunities for solar power The companys sales since have been composed primarily of solar panels Evergreen plans to begin largescale manufacturing of its solar power products in a new manufacturing facility this year Evergreens principal objective is to become a leading producer of highquality solar power products primarily for the ongrid market and the offgrid rural electrification market What makes the company unique according to Evergreen is its String Ribbon technology which reportedly avoids the slicing of a solid block of silicon which is required for most solarpower technologies Evergreens String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half which reduces manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability As noted AstroPowerwhich develops manufacturers and markets PV solar cells modules panels and systemsalso reported a strong first quarter Total revenues for AstroPower were an increase of percent from Q Product revenues were an increase of percent from the same period in the previous year AstroPower is reporting continued strong performance for the company and in fact has stated that it has far more sales opportunities than it can supply There are other companies besides the two Ive mentioned that are actively involved in solar power for instance Amonix BP Solar and United Solar to name a few However the suddenly strong performance of both Evergreen Solar and Active Powerafter previous quarters and even decades of financial lossesindicates that market opportunities have opened up considerably for companies involved in solar power development and marketing So what explains the sudden resurgence of solar power which last experienced any significantly widespread interest in the late s I think there are several factors driving this renewed interest The California impact is obvious as the states energy crisis has shaken many Americans into a new awareness about a national energy crisis However I think the explanation goes deeper than that In addition to the California impact naturalgas prices are now at such a high level that alternatives such as solar power which were previously perceived as cost prohibitive now are becoming costcompetitive In addition many states and the federal government are providing tax incentives for businesses that employ solar electric systems which is making solar panels appealing to a mass market California reportedly pays onehalf of the costs associated with a solar electric system that a business establishes Illinois and Maryland are implementing similar credits The federal government also provides a percent commercial solar tax credit to businesses that employ a solar system and those businesses are also eligible for a fiveyear accelerated depreciated tax reduction Personal energy credits related to solar power were repealed in the early s but some states like California are implementing net metering policies that make it easier for residential customers to install renewablesbased generation solar and wind at their homes In any case solar power is becoming more financially feasible for businesses which is an important factor considering that most solar systems still cost between and However despite this renewed interest and projected growth the American public as a whole is still rather leery about solar power This is a sharp contrast to foreign countries especially where interconnecting to power grids is cumbersome In fact more than threequarters of the photovoltaic cells produced in the United States are sold abroad and foreign production of solar panels internationally has increased percent while US production has increased by percent There are several reasons driving the general reluctance toward this alternative form of power in this country First many still believe that solar power is not and will not become competitive with more conventional sources of electricity such as natural gas or coal As has been often repeated although the sun is free the devices used to capture it are expensive This has kept many endusers utilities and independent power producers tied to their more traditional fuel sources Another reason is that many homeowners and building associations across the country are not receptive to solar power which serves as a deterrent for potential customers that may want to use the sun to power new projects A third reason is that in most areas of the country the sun like the wind is an intermittent fuel source and battery systems that are often expensive must be used to store the power from the sun The other drawback to solar power is the lack of priority it has received from the Bush administration In April President Bush proposed cutting more than million from the federal renewable energy and efficiency research programs which support funding for solar power and other renewable projects The budget will still provide about million to solar wind and other renewable projects down from current spending levels of million However the cuts have been perceived by many as a lack of support for renewable projects by the new administration In fairness to President Bush his energy task force which is scheduled to release its energy plan this week has a potential energy crisis to solve and is focused on immediate solutions Nevertheless apart from the Bush administrations energy plan by all appearances solar power appears to be on the brink of new market interest How extensive this renewed interest will become and to what extent solar power will emerge as a viable power source alternative across the national mass market remain to be seen Also as noted in the report from Reuters investors may be demonstrating only temporary interest in solar power in anticipation of ongoing power shortages this summer However given the high prices of natural gas concerns about emissions from coal and ongoing public resistance to nuclear energy more than any other time in the last two decades solar powers future looks pretty bright An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the

last week Catch up on the latest deregulation competition and restructuring developments in the energy industry with SCIENTECHs IssuesWatch IMAGE IMAGE June Power Shakeup in United Kingdom American Companies Divest as the Brits Expand in the United States By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEBritishbased electricity generator International Power announced th at it is buying a MW coalfired station in central England from TXU Euro pe for million pounds million as part of its expansion in Britain International Power which spun off last year from privatised British utili ty National Power said it expected the MW Rugeley Power Station near Birmingham to increase earnings and generate cash in the first year of operation The Rugeley deal includes a tolling contract until the end of under which TXU Europe part of TXU Corp NYSE TXU will provide coal for the plan and purchase its output Analysis TXUs sale of its Rugeley plant is part of the companys European strategy to expand trading operations and focus on the retail business acro ss the Continent Divesting the coalfired plant in central England while sti ll remaining involved in a tolling agreement with the plants new owner strengthens the balance sheet of parent company TXU Corp and streamlines t he companys European operations so that it can become more focused on profitable ventures such as trading However it is also important to take TXUs sale of its UKbased power plant in the context of several other transactions that are brewing in Britain all of which forecast a major shakeup in the countrys power playing field Further while American companies based in the United Kingdom reevaluate and divest their holdings in Britain UKbased companies continue an aggressive and profitable expansion into the US market Clearly International Power is a British company that is more squarely focused on the traditional generation market than TXU Europe For instance International Powerwhich also has interests in Australia southeast Asia the United States and across continental EuropeFa worldwide gener ation capacity of about MW Thus acquiring additional generating assets in its home country makes sense for International Power which by the way has outperformed its Londonlisted electricity company peers by more than percent so far this year In contrast divesting the Rugeley assets seems to be a strategic move for TXU which has been in the process of divesting other European assets over the last six months In February TXU Europe announced the sale of its North Sea assets which was the first indication that the company was movin g away from a hardasset strategy across the Continent The company had bough t stakes in several North Sea gas fields as part of its expansion into Britains energy business However the divestiture of these assets was initiated out of TXU Europes desire to concentrate more exclusively on trading operations in Europe Consort Resources a UK startup company th at also operates in the North Sea has agreed to acquire TXU Europes upstream gas business located in the region for million In addition to divesting its North Sea gas business TXU Europe also announced in February of this year that it is seeking to sell its percen t stake in Spains Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico Following the planned divestitures TXU Europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading This is understandable as the company has quickly become o ne of the major forces in the trading market since a number of European countries have opened their electric and gas markets to competition upon t he directive of the European union In fact TXU Corp reported a percent jump in revenue for Q which it attributed in large part to its energ y trading business both in the United States and the United Kingdom where revenue more than doubled However as noted in addition to furthering TXUs own European strategy t he divestiture of the Rugeley plants is also part of an emerging game of music al chairs in the UK power market In addition to a change in business model many American companies may be looking to sell their UK power assets in response to Britains intense regulatory scrutiny of energy profits and the application of the countrys windfall profit tax In other words companies such as TXU may find that any value in holding onto UK assets may be overshadowed by taxes enforced by the British government In any case TXU is not the only American energy company looking to divest UK assets For instance ScottishPower the Glasgow Scotlandbased utili ty that owns PacifiCorp in the United States is reportedly holding talks with Entergy Corp about purchasing Entergys two UK gasfired generation assets Damhead Creek and Saltend According to some financial analysts th e two plants which have a combined capacity of about MW could earn Entergy as much as billion a figure that seems awfully high Similar to TXU Entergy is looking to divest the UK generating assets to support its thriving wholesale trading business As a sidenote the possible sale o f Entergys UK generating assets was cited as one of the factors that contributed to the companys failed merger with FPL Group earlier this year Just like International Power it would make sense for ScottishPower to increase its asset base in the United Kingdom The company has reportedly increased its retail supply business in England and needs to hedge the cost of selling power in the country In addition to possible interest in Entergys UKbased gas plants it has also been reported that ScottishPower along with potential partner Southern Energy not to be confused with Mirant Corp which was formerly known as Southern Energy ar e also interested in Seeboard a regional UK electricity company currently owned by American Electric Power AEP Moreover this growing interest in Seeboard also represents another critica l component of the UK power shakeup Seeboard serves around two million connected customers in England in the towns of Kent Sussex and Surrey Under its brand name of Seeboard Energy which combines electricity from Seeboard and gas from Beacon Gas a joint venture with BP Amoco the compa ny sells dual fuel to customers throughout the United Kingdom Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables and along with consortium partners also manages and operates the electricity distribution system serving the London Underground Again AEP as Seeboards current owner is looking to divest the company in order to focus on European power generatio n marketing and trading Up until a few weeks ago it appeared that Electricite de France EDF was the leading contender to acquire Seeboard Having previously purchased Lond on Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales and a supplier to approximately two million customers in metro London it w as a smart move for EDF to further expand its base in the United Kingdom with additional acquisitions Through its London Electricity subsidiary EDF mad e a billion pound billion offer for Seeboard which AEP rejected However as recently as last week it was still up in the air what will become of the Seeboard assets The last word is that London Electricity continues to negotiate with AEP but the American company reportedly faces a multimilliondollar tax bill if it sells the UK assets before June According to a report in Reuters AEP now claims that it will proceed with the sale only if EDF assumes the tax bill associated with the sale of Seeboard As noted while American companies continue to reevaluate and divest their UK electricity assets British companies are taking full advantage of deregulation and power supply concerns in the United States I already mentioned the fact that ScottishPower is looking to expand beyond its ownership of PacifiCorp with further acquisitions of American energy companies Portland General has been named as a strong possibility In addition UKbased National Grid aims to become the premier transmissi on operator in the United States Toward that end National Grid has been aggressively acquiring US companies that are consistent with its emphasis on the transmission and distribution business For instance National Grid is currently in the process of acquiring Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc NYSE NMK an upstate New York energy services company Niagara Mohawk is the third acquisition that National Grid has made in the United States and all three purchases have been of utilities based in the Northeastern part of th e country In National Grid purchased New England Electric System NEES and Eastern Utilities Associates EUA which provided National Grid with strong transmission and distribution assets in Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshire Of course the UK company Powergen completed its acquisition of Louisvill e Kybased LGOlast December which has helped the British company to establi sh a presence in the Midwest market Powergen has acknowledged that it continu es to look for additional US companies to acquire Further the Bush administrations plan that calls for new energy productio n efforts has opened up new windows of opportunity for British companies to further expand in the United States In addition to any acquisitions that i t might make in this country ScottishPower also reportedly plans to construc t new MW power generators in three US states Also British Energy a UKbased nuclear power supplier hopes to capitalize on plans to increase nuclear power in the United States with the sponsorship of new nuclear plan ts taking advantage of President Bushs call for tax subsidies for nuke plants Note also that British Energy formed a partnership with PECO Energ y creating AmerGen that is in the business of purchasing power plants In addition given ongoing concerns about naturalgas supply in the United States British gas companies such as BG Group British Petroleum and Shell are reportedly looking into the construction of gasfired plants in this country All of this makes for a very interesting dichotomy as American companies continue to divest their power assets in the United Kingdom while British companies acquire further holdings in this country An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Victorias Office of the RegulatorGeneral in Australia ruled last Thursda y that the states five electricity distribution companies must reduce averag e network charges by between and percent starting January ANALYSIS There used to be a time not long ago when utilities were strategically addressing electric deregulation by diversifying into new growth business es and in most cases many still are Concerned about the impact competition will have on the industry utilities have conducted studies and research to try and make themselves more appealing to consumers The result is a flurry of activity to diversify Some companies diversify their services in an attempt to be a onestop shopping utility Utilities across the US are offering home security systems mobile phones and other telecommunications services Then there are the rational utilities who decide to stay in the business that they know best the wires business This is due to the fact that the wires business still remains regulated at a decent return for the typic al shareholder of what was the regulated utility and will become the regulated wires company Lets take a look at some other countries that have deregulated before the US and see how their wires companies have fared First after the massive US takeover of the British utilities RECs in the British government enacted a new law in July that imposed a onetime windfall tax on the revised privatization value which originally had been computed in on privatized utilities OK so this is an anomaly It is not usually a cost of doing business in the wiresonl y environment Second in December of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets OFGEM the UK gas and electric regulatory body published final proposa ls for new rates in the distribution business and for price caps in the supply business The final proposals reduced distribution rates beginning on April of and it was not an Aprils Fool joke Third Australias state of Victoria appears to be helping set the trend of making the wires business more efficient by mandating a reduction in their rates They also ruled to set targets for different companies within the state to improve reliability by between and percent It appears this regulated wires business is getting measured by a competitive business standard In any sense lets bring it home California has becom e the summer poster child for examples in the electric industry They have an unregulated wholesale market that is spiking while the retail market in one territory is open to feel the pain price of electricity while the other areas are protected at least at the end consumer level But who eats the difference The retailer of course Well the retailer in California just happens to be the wires company incumbent service provider So while PGE is trying to figure out how to recover these astronomical gaps in what they pay for wholesale electricity and what they retail it for they may end up eating it This actually qualifies for that anomaly argument that the UK experienced because it should not be the norm In a true deregulated market wires should take care of getting electrons to customers while retailers should handle the commodity and valueadded services I know of only one state in the US that is proposing this model for their opening date Texas Can wires survive on their own You bet But I believe there are trends forming that will have to be addressed by any company focusing on a wires strategy The new wires companies will come under regulatory scrutiny to become more efficient Their rates will be reduced and they will be expected to increase reliability In other words do more with less This will mean two things One size is important Scale always produces efficiency in one form or another Second these new companies will seek efficiencies in cost savings This is one reason for the explosive growth in the supply chain and exchange areas of the utility industry Do not expect your local regulator to stick to the costplus method of calculating rates for wires This does raise an interesting question that I will save for another day How does the wires company successfully raise investment capital for improv ing its distribution system with such low rates of return DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance or Lack Thereof of Information Technology in the Energy Industry By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the CEO Mega Panel View From the Top at the th annual EEIAGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc e in Phoenix this week The moderator was Charles Bayless former chairman president and CEO of Illinova The remaining three CEOs included Keith Stamm CEO Aquila Energy Dr Matthew Cordaro president and CEO Midwest ISO and James Pignatelli chairman president and CEO UniSource Energy ANALYSIS This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner The conference organizers did a good job in getting a crosssection of the energy industry in transition The trading organization specialist was represented with Aquila the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes t ISO and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource Energy Each panelist was asked what role information technology IT played in their respective organization Their answers may surprise you Dr Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first Dr Cordaro stressed that IT was very critical to the operation of an ISO saying it is essentially the foundation of the ISO He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions every week in a realtime operation Among the responsibilities that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are monitoring the congestion on the grid and taking appropriate action preventing gaming through market monitoring settlement processing who owes who what and handling the dispute process The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati on RTO Alliance on July of this year to deliver an integrated control center system ICCS that when complete will provide million in infrastructure for the MISO The RTO Alliance which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation of Seattle Open Access Technology International OATI of Minneapolis Perot Systems of Dallas Texas and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City Utah will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission The hardware and software in the ICCS project will support MISOs operational functions including transmission planning reservation scheduling realtime monitor ing and control settlement and billing Dr Cordaro also stated that Lodestar was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to ATT Solutions Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next Keith began by clarifying Aquilas focus as trading owning very little assets in a highvolume lowmargin highvolatility business IT is very important in the trading business Realtime information must be known and disseminated appropriately to the right individuals Keith believes that one of Aquilas strategic asset s and strengths is its risk management system Aquila strives for a realtim e calculation of risk Aquila Energy a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc has been a surprisin g winner in the trading marketplace this year showing a percent growth since last year with billion total revenue for the past six months of that million in trading revenue compared to million in The EBIT was million vs million a year ago Aquila has gathered top traders and intellectual financial and risk management personnel to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies including top traders AEP and Duke Energy as an investment step Aquila perceived was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin g platforms The Energy Trading Consortium Duke Energy AEP Aquila Energy Reliant Energy Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy is in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap benefits from the transaction cost liquidity volume and speed of exchange This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to onetomany Another competitor recently launched is eSpeeds TradeSpark James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial statements concerning information technology James stated that IT in the vertically integrated utility is not strategic at least not at the present time James believes that IT will become strategic someday in the deregulated market James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the IT arena He mentioned pulling in his IT folks and saying Lets switch the distribution network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances well switch back to AC While James comments may have been controversial with the more than attendees and approximately energy CIOs in the audienc e he does have a point The vertically integrated utilitys core strength is to generate power and distribute it to captive customers reliably While some IT systems like outage management and SCADA devices may be strategic in this sense the other parts of IT are questionable and could be candidates for outsourcing James claims to be working on BB and BC initiatives at the moment His vision for BC is a smart chip in the residence that has access to instantaneous pricing information The residence will buy electricity for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce load thereby reducing the TD utility to a simple conduit for service James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior to its sale to AES In Tucson Electric invested million in NEV and Charles Bayless then Tucson Electrics chairman president and chief executive officer and James Pignatelli Tucson Electrics senior vice president and chief operating officer served on New Energy Ventures administrative committee It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated IT systems If one were to stop and think about it deregulation could not occur without the complex IT systems that are employed today in the marketplace I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have thought about an unbundled electric

more about SCIENTECHs Mergers Acquisitions and Convergence in the US Electric Industry InfoGrid at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM announced yesterday that it intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka Kansas based Western Resources WR in a taxfree stockforstock transaction The deal will require that WR separate its nonutility assets from its regulated utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders ANALYSIS In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry strategic combinations are becoming more commonplace This announcement took me by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of merger WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp United by attempting to acquire KCPL in At the time WR share price was above In WR share price soared to record highs of more than WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed They sold their interest in ADT for a million profit This profit masked a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the time was cutting WR rates by million reducing earnings by cents per share WR who obviously had a strategic focus on security used the profits from the ADT sale to purchase percent of Protection One one of the fastest growing companies in the monitored security business Protection One hit some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result their stock tumbled WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be favorable to them As a result some moved their money out of WR and by WR share price had tumbled to to In January of this year KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off the merger WR immediately split itself into two organizations regulated utility operations and nonregulated business with the intent of finding a buyer for the regulated utility operations WR claimed in June of this year that companies were being courted including international companies for the utility operations assets of Kansas Power Light KPL and Kansas Gas and Electric KGE Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me But it does fit SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba CEO of PNM just weeks ago and asked if the development of alliances mergers and acquisitions were a part of the positive approach to PNMs strategy Jeff answered Very definitely Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business and that can bring a sustainable competitive advantage are essential for us in this industry The criticality of market channels cant be overemphasized Once you have a good market channel that doesnt mean that everything you put through that market channel you have to do yourself or you have to own You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances There are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves something that is core to your business So both alliances and acquisitions will be a part of PNMs future Just weeks later PNM is buying WR Utilizing my rear view mirror now I see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM They both operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix including nuclear They both have multicommodity in electric and gas They both have wholesale operations PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part to a strong wholesale operation PNM net earnings for the nine months ended Sept totaled million or per share diluted on total operating revenues of billion compared to earnings of million or per share in the first three quarters of PNM has adopted a niche strategy in the wholesale power market by developing tailored wholesale power products for its customers While some of the megatraders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard commodity PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according to the needs of the buyer PNM has found success in this niche segment of a large wholesale market The merger deal is expected to take between and months to complete PNM will inherit approximately billion in debt making the total value of the deal worth billion Fitch has placed its securities ratings of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving Fitch plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact of the merger Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist between Wichita and Topeka This may result in a rate case It should also be noted that Wichita Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover municipalize the electric system from Western Resources within its city limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka Wichita has about power customers roughly a fourth of all the customers served by Western Resources They represent more than million of KGEs million in revenues PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has demonstrated its ability to do so PNM has decreased its debttocapital ratio from percent to less than percent in the last seven years The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque NM and the chairman president and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba Search SCIENTECHs PowerHitter archive to read about our

preferred to be served by Green Mountain On the other hand it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company founded earlier this year by Enron along with partners AOL and IBM As you may recall just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply competitive default service for approximately of PECOs residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement arguing that the PECOTNPC agreement is not in the public interest and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question Thus it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services Up to this point TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers such as the approximately natural gas and electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group The acquisition of the customers in PECOs territory was a major coup for TNPC which is still in startup mode Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy Community Energy the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatthours allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power Interestingly the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about MW of green power to aggregated state agencies This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio Thus while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPCs original business plan the company appears to be moving in this direction at least in states where it is strategic to do so However this announcement comes on the heels of TNPCs announcement of its thirdquarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price TNPCs revenues for Q were million derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states Pennsylvania and New Jersey Gross profit was million or percent of revenues Yet the loss on earnings before income tax EBIT was million The net loss for the quarter was million or per basic share TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history Therefore the company contends that its yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance The companys goal for Q is to achieve revenues of approximately to million with an estimated yearend customer count of Eugene Lockhart TNPCs CEO said he was pleased with the Q performance Lockhart contends that TNPC achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives and referenced the fact that the company is still building its systems and architecture so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets In addition TNPC has raised approximately million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation However despite its positive outlook after TNPC made its earnings announcement its shares took a nosedive perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy providers ability to meet its objectives The shares closed last Friday at which is a dramatic drop from the average price of before the Q earnings announcement TNPC issued its IPO on Oct at a price of per share which at the time seemed quite high for a startup energy company with a limited track record A day after its opening the stock closed at per share The stock was received so favorably for two reasons in my estimation First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners among others put up about million in startup capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner of TNPC with percent control Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over customers Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock and the company is at a crossroads In order to keep its momentum on track TNPC needs to do two things First it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states Second as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors Consequently it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven Regarding the customer base expansion Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target Just last week the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state Yet its clear that TNPC is still finetuning its marketing approach In Ohio it is offering customers competitive energy prices flexible payment and pricing choices and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive but there is no mention in TNPCs application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio Moreover several questions remain Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC Will TNPC demonstrate revenues of million in Q And where will the companys next acquisition of customers take place All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC Miss last week Catch up on

article Bright Lights A Conversation With Kevin Jordan President of Excel Energy Technologies Ltd at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml SCIENTECH IssueAlert November SmartEnergy Rounds Up million in Financing Is an IPO in the Works By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities venture capital and global banks SmartEnergy a privately held Internetbased energy service provider active in New York plans to use the funding as working capital to rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment schedule ANALYSIS You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago IssueAlert Oct when I drew attention to the fact that the online startup was taking customers away from ConEdison In existence only since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers Under a promotion currently under way in New York SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to percent on energy through the winter months for naturalgas customers in the boroughs of New York City and Westchester County Capitalizing on ongoing threats about low supplies of oil and natural gas SmartEnergy is using the socalled energy crisis to lure customers away from the traditional utility by locking in current naturalgas rates over the course of the next months under its Smart Fixed Rate plan As a policy SmartEnergy hedges the products that its sell to customers so that neither the company nor its customers is exposed to energy market price risks In addition SmartEnergy has offered United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement to secure customers As I discussed last month an advantage that online energy providers such as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers In addition operating online allows SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets Up until now SmartEnergys marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York state However the company claims that it will be serving six states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the end of this year SmartEnergy expects to be serving all deregulated states by the end of and the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support this anticipated growth Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns as the energy industry continues to become deregulated Investors that are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy WPS Resources Corporation Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors In addition there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round including Dexia Ventures the private equity arm of Dexia Bank a USD billion asset bank based in Belgium KBC Bank and venture capitalist groups Trust Capital Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures The inclusion of both American and European investors is important Coupled with SmartEnergys intention to operate in all US states that are deregulating the fact that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic The fact that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform of worldwide service In fact Alliant Energy identified the strong growth of the Internet and technology in the energy segment as a key reason why it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy In fact the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison Wisbased Alliant has been in existence for several months The utilitys nonregulated subsidiary Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy to expand a decidedly efocused business The partnership with SmartEnergy represents Alliants new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies offering stateoftheart technology and new products and services for customers In fact Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as the energy company of today and tomorrow and believes that it has a platform that can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world Of course my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy It would certainly be an obvious move for the private company to head in this direction especially now as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street Ive written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like Evergreen Solar Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid IPOs as a result of in my opinion their business models in new technologies and or alternative fuels There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years With few exceptions energy companies exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several months have performed comparatively well As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid startup companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer service again resulting from its online presence Customer interaction can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet enabling account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at any time The downside of course is customer reluctance to sign up with a startup company that they may not know In addition SmartEnergy faces tough competition from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in deregulated markets including Utilitycom and Essentialcom None of these companies has yet gone public and are instead focusing on building critical mass and establishing their brand identities Yet of the three SmartEnergy may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion and could be on the fast track to an IPO in the near term SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts and consultants will get results Learn more about our

Weigand Chairman and CEO of Skipping Stone is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Utilitycom Uses M Financing to Grow eUtilities Partnerships By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Utilitycom announced that it has completed its third round of venture financing raising over million Gaz de France one of the top three European gas companies led the deal Utilitycom will use funds raised in this third round to support operations as it implements its eUtilities Program partnerships which it has formed with traditional utilities in the United States and abroad ANALYSIS Financing from venture capitalists seems to be the theme of the week Just yesterday I wrote about SmartEnergy finishing its Series A round of financing in which it received million from a mix of American and European investors that included Alliant Energy as a major contributor In my analysis I mentioned Utilitycom as a competitor of SmartEnergy and argued that the latter appeared to be moving along more aggressively with a plan to become operational in all deregulating US states and across Europe About an hour after I distributed my column Utilitycom announced this significant round of financing which certainly rejuvenates its position as the worlds first Internet utility If case you are not familiar with Utilitycoms business model the company offers electricity natural gas telephone and Internet access to customers in competitive markets In fact as individual US states have moved close r to competition it seems as if Utilitycom has begun operating in all of those states Its marketing strategy has been to promote cost savings reliability and the convenience of operating online In addition with the bundled services of various offerings Utilitycom promotes a onestop shopping approach for multiple services with billing and customer service s all available online As noted Gaz de France led this third round of financing for Utilitycom It seem curious that Gaz de France would be such a primary participant in the investments but keep in mind that Europe continues to privatize its gas and electricity markets Gaz de France along with its electric counterpart EDF is investing in various energy companies to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across Europe Utilitycom of course benefits because Europe when it does privatize completely will represent a very lucrative energy market and one that could potentially exceed the US energy market Joining Gaz de France in the investment in Utilitycom are some heavy hitte rs both traditional utility companies and investors that are banking on the hope that companies like Utilitycom will start capitalizing from deregulat ion in the nearterm The list of investors is impressive Southern Company Energy Marketing Sempra Energy Trading idealab idealab Capital Partner s Trident Capital PRIMEDIA Ventures Kinetic Ventures TL Ventures Moore Capital Management and Sumitomo Corporation of Japan As noted this was Utilitycoms third round of investments and all previous investors contributed again in this round Utilitycoms relationship with Southern Company is one of the foundations on which the company was built Southern Company was one of the original investors in Utilitycom and serves as the companys preferred wholesale provider What this means is that as Utilitycom markets electricity to customers across deregulated markets the power is typically coming from Southern Company In previous discussions Ive had with Chris King Utilitycoms CEO he has reiterated that although Southern Company is a preferred provider it is not Utilitycoms only provider Southern has given us very good pricing and weve taken advantage of their scale economies being the largest energy generator in the country King told me a few months ago But we dont use them exclusively to ensure that we get competitor pricing from them If they ever give us a price that we dont like for whatever reason we can go out and get a price from somebody else It seems pretty clear that Utilitycom will use this financing to grow its unique eUtilities Program partnerships along with expanding its core operations Its eUtilities partnerships are focused on cobranding and comarketing of services with specific utility companies For instance Utilitycom has formed eUtilities partnerships with Kansas City Power and Light and FirstEnergy The eUtilities program enables Utilitycom to put together a cobranded site where it can sell energy and other related services The program also has helped Utilitycom to expand into states before deregulation has opened competition For instance in Missouria state that is still regulatedcustomers can sign up with Utilitycom and still have all of their utility services consolidated into one online package Even without savings generated from deregulation many customers are still finding value in the convenience that Utilitycom offers Just in the last month Utilitycom also began working with electric cooperatives The company formed a partnership with EnPower a consortium of member elect ric cooperatives providing energy products and services in Iowa Illinois Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota and Wisconsin Utilitycom will provide participating EnPower member cooperatives with UtilityOne an information technology and Internet infrastructure platform for utility services UtilityOne supports marketing and provisioning of multiple utilities over the Internet and serves Utilitycoms electricity telecommunications and Internet customers across the country This move follows an expansion of Utilitycoms telecommunications offerings with the introduction of Utilitycom Long Distance An introducto ry plan called Utilitycom Common Cents offers free minutes of longdistan ce service to customers for statetostate calls during the first month of service Utilitycom hopes to offer this service to customers in states by the end of this month Of course as I discussed in my analysis of SmartEnergy it is natural to speculate on whether or not Utilitycom is gearing up for an IPO When I spoke with Chris King last summer he admitted that going public is always something you have in mind when you have a company like this As Utilitycom continues to find willing investors that will support its inten ded growth an IPO would be a natural progression as Wall Street currently favors energy company stocks that are involved in technologies Utilitycom does face stiff competition of course and SmartEnergy is perhaps the leader of that group Another competitor is Essentialcom which offers a very similar service offering to Utilitycom Both Utilitycom and Essentialcom are licensed energy providers meaning that they contract with wholesale providers to purchase energy that they will resell to endusers Both companies are responsible for all forecasting and settlement issues which can be difficult when working with different states Yet one key difference that Utilitycom offers is its partnerships with utilities By partnering direct ly with utilities such as Southern Company Utilitycom by association gains the powerful brand identity of companies that energy customers already trust This is a strategy that SmartEnergy also is using by partnering with Alliant Energy As additional states deregulate it will be very interesting to see which of these online providers gain a significant market share and whether or not a large percentage of energy customers will want to conduct their utility transactions online DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

<10804876.1075859663456.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-11-16 03:36:00,Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal Learn about SCIENTECHS most popular competitive tools including the Mergers and Acquisitions Telecommunications and ECommerce InfoGrids at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to be built according to a new report from Financial Times Energy The additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through but also includes Finland France Germany Sweden and the United Kingdom At the same time concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being exacerbated by Germanys plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power ANALYSIS If FT Energys projections for necessary generation additions in Europe are accurate I think there are some real challenges that the Continent will face in reaching this goal First off for perspective lets be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming Europe will need by The figure of MW is roughly equivalent to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system in Texas When we consider also that the United States consumes about double the amount of power that Europe consumes the projection that Europe will need an additional MW of new generating capacity is a staggering proposition Granted like other developed areas of the world Europes energy consumption has grown over the last two years According to data included in its report FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from terrawatthours TWh in to TWh in an increase of about percent per year While this may seem like a minimal increase it is important to note that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average For instance estimated new capacity additions through are mainly concentrated in Spain France Germany and Sweden The growth in demand coupled with market liberalization has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction or purchase of generation assets Although reportedly percent of the electricity market across Europe has been liberalized to date the Continent remains rather disjointed as it is composed of national markets that are all approaching privatization at different speeds The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their privatization movements in the early s Spain required its stateowned utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February a process that will continue through Germany decided to open percent of its market all at once in April And France resisted efforts to privatize and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European Union Consequently although Europe may in fact need the MW of new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected the type and extent to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on the energy policy of each independent nation A variety of restrictions may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount of capacity Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization and by extension its approach to generation development I cant examine the policy of each country in this forum but I think a look at Germany is warranted both because it is a major component of Europes total energy market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact the Continent as a whole Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened to competition It follows that generation coming from Germany should contribute a large percentage of the Continents future power needs However a large percentage of Germanys power has come from nuclear power but that has all changed over the last year After the Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party nuclear energy became an unacceptable energy source The German government has essentially put a moratorium on nuclear power and in fact decided to eventually shut down nuclear power plants in the country Just last month Germanys two largest power producers RWE AG and EON AG announced plans to cut output from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has developed since Germany liberalized its market The measures amount to a reduction of about percent in Germanys overall power generating capacity Moreover nuclear energy has generated over onethird of Germanys nearly billion kilowatthours of annual electricity demand and onethird of Western Europes total electricity supply As the future of nuclear power in Germany looks rather dim big questions surround what will replace nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europes energy industry Coal currently produces about percent of the power generation in Germany but as a result of the countrys attempts to lower emissions coal also appears to be on a decline Also in Germany as in the rest of Europe coalindustry subsidies will come to an end as early as making it less economical to invest in coalfired plants At the same time other countries like France are exploring cleancoal technologies but it is questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand across the Continent Generally natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will take the place of nuclear power in Europe given the seemingly abundant supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea However as demand across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases this may impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe In addition there are no effective rules across Europe for thirdparty access to private pipeline grids also putting into question the future of naturalgas supplies Also as we have seen in the United States as demand for natural gas increases so will the prices which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary power source As a result much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable energy In fact the German government wants to double renewable energy output to percent of total energy demand by using such forms as hydroelectric and wind power This seems consistent with what the rest of Europe is doing The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate percent of its electricity from renewable resources by Scandinavian countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and lowemission forms of energy with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of the Nordic regions total electricity production Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western Europe with projects in Germany Denmark and Spain ranking among the fastestgrowing in the world Again according to the US DOE wind power is projected to grow by percent per year in Western Europe This growth prospective is pretty dismal and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe Renewable energy works fine when planning overall energy needs but it rarely can be relied on to meet peak demand The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to and the sun shines when it wants to which can make peak planning based on renewable energy difficult if not impossible This being the case many critics say Europes current move toward renewable energy is completely unrealistic arguing that it would take nearly wind turbines to equal one nuclear plant In addition the growth for renewable energy is plotted over the course of ten to fifteen years FT Energy marks the year as the point at which Europe will need the additional MW of generating capacity In addition despite the fact that coalfired generation poses pollution problems it is still a comparatively lowcost form of generation This will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence of a strong worldwide commitment The US Department of Energy projects only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy through just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain a slim percent share of the total world energy consumption So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs First keep in mind that Ive focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role in Europe as a whole However the restrictions on nuclear power are not necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries For instance the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by opening a plant in Temelin The question is without Germanys contribution of nuclear power will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other power sources and other countries Although the MW goal seems very ambitious Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use of merchant plants As competition continues wholesale power buyers are demanding shorterterm contracts which in turn is supporting a growing trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent Presently only the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power but there are signs that the trend is extending to Italy Spain the Netherlands and even Germany In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear power merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europes naturalgas market Yet as we have seen in California the plant siting process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles and it is not clear if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries Plus the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily naturalgas fired which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source Moreover just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter due to our own brand of energy supply problems we are finding that the problem is not limited to our part of the world It is of course unknown if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of MW by Yet at the same time it is clear that demand on the Continent continues to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at webrciwebnsfwebDeptsIAhtml SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we

Duke Energy Offers FixedPriced Electricity Package for SDGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Duke Energy through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE M W electricity load The offer would establish a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for wholesale power supply for the next five years based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENA s proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in commen ts submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electric ity market ANALYSIS As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere SDGE customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity last summer and into this fall which resulted primarily from an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California In addition other contributory factors have included the states economic growth lack of new power plants over the last decade unstable existing generation and the uncertainty of import prospects As SDGEs rate freeze had been lifted last spring customers of the utilit y were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded cents per kilowatthour compared to the cent per kilowatt hour maximum they had become accustomed to under the rate freeze The problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices However SDGE customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for Californias other two IOUs SCE and PGE DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power for the totality of SDGEs MW electricity load In return DENAs proposed fixed rate of cents per kilowatt hour plus annual percent increases presumably will be much lower than the cost SDGE customers will continue to face without such a contract DENAs proposal has been made possible as a result of FERCs proposed order that was issued last month outlining a major overhaul of Californias energy market Since competition began in the state in the spring of the three California IOUs were required to buy their power from the states Power Exchange FERCs order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a very lucrative contract while at the same time attempting to protect SDGE customers from exorbitant electricity prices So what is SDGEs response to DENAs proposal I spoke with Doug Kline spokesperson for the utility yesterday afternoon Kline pointed out that first of all SDGE has not yet received any offer from DENA and that all weve seen thus far is a press release Kline suggested that it was a public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal to FERC and that ultimately SDGE would be the one to accept DENAs offer In order to speak in detail on DENAs proposal Kline said he would need to see an actual contract which has yet to materialize Kline did disclose that locking up longterm contracts for SDGE customers based on todays high prices would have to be seriously questioned by the utility especial ly considering that new generation will be coming online in California over the next few years Beyond that SDGE is fielding other offers from energy suppliers and in fact has established longterm contracts with other providers which remain unidentified for percent of the power it buys on the wholesale market Back in September the CPUC granted approval for SDGE as well as SCE and PGE to purchase percent of its power in forward markets with the other percent still coming from the PX For SDGE this amounts to MW of its total electricity load Kline said that SDGE would need to compare DENAs offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDGE customers At the same time Sempra EnergySDGEs parent companyhas made its o wn proposal to FERC urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDGE customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates based on generators actual fees Under FERCs proposed order the commission suggested a soft rate cap of MWh Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generator setting a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to as it says fix the crisis in California In fact back in August DENA offered California Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver MW of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie s and provide all three IOUs with fiveyear fixedpriced supply contracts Although Gov Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three IOUs SCE and PGE proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts with DENA Both deals were sealed within the last month although the speci fic prices of the contracts are proprietary DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state Just two weeks ago the company broke ground on a million modernization of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County The modernization effor t is projected to add MW of new capacity to sites current MW and create the states largest power plant DENA claims that when complete d the MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale electricity to serve approximately million households In addition DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to modernize and expand two other power plants in California Morro Bay and South Bay power plants DENAs motivations are pretty understandable The company may espouse good intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but realistically energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state I started to notice the trend last month as Q earnings were reported Virtua lly every company that is active in Californias wholesale market reported a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatili ty DENA was no exception As a whole Duke Energy reported record Q earnings of per share a percent increase over earnings per share of for Q The companys North American Wholesale Energycomprised of DENA and Duke Energy Merchantsposted sharply higher gains with EBIT of million a percent increase over Q According to Duke Energy s report DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power plants and from natural gas and power trading activities DENA remains on schedule to deliver approximately megawatts of new merchant generation nationally in time for summer Moreover it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENAs offer truly benefit s SDGE and its customers The proposal certainly benefits DENA however especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current high prices and includes annual increases Securing SDGE customers under these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market but how it stacks up against SDGEs other unnamed offers remains to be seen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Peace Software a global provider of leading ebusiness solutions for retai l energy companies announced that MidAmerican Energy Company a supplier of energy in the Midwests deregulating market has selected Peaces Energy software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets Peace Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels services and locations on a single statement said Todd Raba vice preside nt of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy ANALYSIS This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies On the national or international stage Des Moines Iowabased MidAmerican may not be considered a major player Yet within the Midwest it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence The company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than MW of diversified power generation facilities around the world providing both regulated and unregulated electric and naturalgas services to more than million customers in six states and the United Kingdom through its Northern Electr ic Gas subsidiary In August MidAmerican made its move into Ohio the fourth largest US market in terms of customers behind California Texas and Florida indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive Midwest market Just last Monday MidAmerican became the first energy compa ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier CRES in the Cincinnati Gas Electric Co territory in southwest Ohio An essential element to the utilitys growth is a comprehensive billing software system which is where the value of Peace Software comes in According to MidAmerican it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Also important to MidAmerican as it enters different states is the elimination of several automated and manual processes required by our current system This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software In this particular case Peaces Energy software will provide to MidAmerica n customers several selfserve features including customer enrollment summa ry billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in a onestopshop tool Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra cts prior to this one with MidAmerican including Enron BC Gas Dominion Retai l Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services The company is based in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utilities I spoke with Brian Peace CEO of Peace Software last June and he gave an overview of how the Energy System functions First the Energy System is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another Since its start in Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multipleproduct architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water gas and electricity into one product suite Currently the system handles not only those three commodities but also can consolidate billing information relat ed to telecommunications home security home mortgaging and other valueadded commodities and services The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing At the time of our discussion Peace said ESPs can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore Theyve got to be able to buy it at the right price combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers This is the path to being competiti ve and profitable Over the last decade Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand market and began selling its technology in the United States in That same year the company secured a contract with Enron which at the time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California retail market Of course Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin g efforts in California but still uses the Peace Energy software as it continues to penetrate other markets Peace Softwares alliance with InSITEa New Yorkbased application service providerhas led to providing the softwar e for the billing needs of Exelon Brian Peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers Of course although Peace Softwares contract with MidAmerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market the billing software business presents stiff competition Perhaps the two greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy SCT offers the SCT Banner product which was originally created to bill multiple commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well ENLOGIX uses the SCT Banner system to support multiservices across its client base including gas financing ancillary products electricity water and solid waste Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and Australia Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets Peace has entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver which serves about customers Excelergy has implemented its billing product at Boston Gas which serves about customers As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multifaceted billing and customer care system Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the valueadded service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line Obsessively Relentlessly At Your Service The company is obviously making customer service a centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite to support its entry into new markets

Pennsylvania Customers Continues to Go Green By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company reported that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Competitive Default Service Agreeme nt between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost customers The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few days ANALYSIS As you may recall a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount ain about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energys service territory Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately residential electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service provider registered within the state This represented about percent of PECOs residential customer base Three energy providersTNPC Green Mountain and one other unidentified companybid for the customers with various service packages PECO chose TNPC which had offered a fixed discou nt of percent for the residential customers because it believed the offer was in the best interest of PECO customers Green Mountain contested this decision arguing that its hydro and natural gasbased energy package would ultimately be less expensive for consumers and environmentally cleaner Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed offer was a full percent less than PECOs shopping credit compared to TNPCs offer which would average about percent below the shopping credit PECOs response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer Over the last month both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECOs customers which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most successful retail market in the United States if not the world The PUC ruling clearly puts the PECO customers into the hands of TNPC which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing alliance between Enron AOL and IBM Securing the residential customers in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the Pennsylvania market The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not shopped for an alternative supplier under the states electric competition program However what I find most interesting about the latest development in this case is whats happening behind the scenes of the dispute and more specifically how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective I discussed just two weeks ago IssueAlert from Nov that TNPCs stock NYSE NPW was taking a nosedive Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in early October TNPCs IPO offering of million common shares was priced at per share a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has only been in existence since May of this year Momentum grew as the first day of trading saw the stock price climb to Yet contrast that with the current stock price of as of Nov and certainly questions about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge The decline in TNPC stock seemed to start when the company reported a Q loss of million or per share TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due its limited operating history but investors seemed to think otherwise Around the same time that TNPCs stock began to drop the company announced that it would be adding windgenerated energy to its package for customers in the Philadelphia area Under terms of a brandnew agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen t in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania My reaction to this announcemen t was that TNPCs addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain Yet TNPCs move toward renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock price In another ironic twist TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh ip with Green Mountain which was an adversary only last month TNPC disclosed that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition of up to competitive default service customers out of the within PECOs territory Reportedly the relationship will benefit Pennsylvania consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals In addition TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner is consistent with its objective of enhancing a positive customer portfoli o value However considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of the customers from PECO it seems odd that the company would sudden ly be willing to share of them with Green Mountain Certainly Green Mountain wins from this partnership The company gains residential customers when it based on the PUCs ruling could have ended up with nothing The company offers three service packages in Pennsylvania EcoSmart EnviroBlend and Natures Choice varying mixes of hydro natural gas and new renewables with Natures Choice containing more renewables than the other two power blends Marketing power that it bills as dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy What remains very unclear is TNPCs true motivations and the future of the company which made such a big splash when it began operating last spring Is this a classic case of an energy startup chasing down trends eg the current high value of renewable energy stocks in order to rejuvenate itself or a true identity transformation The questions are pertinent as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to struggle DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Strategic and Competitive

IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countri es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will repre sent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europ e to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billi on cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decisi on is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merge r strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategi c contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas tradin g and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci al endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japan s first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals includin g Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Develops New Wind Facility in Texas by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Enron Wind and Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI affiliates of Enron Corp NYSE ENE announced completion of a transaction in which Enron Wind will build a MW wind power facility near Iraan Texas in Pecos County Unde r a related agreement EPMI will purchase the projects electricity under a longterm agreement for resale into the Texas wholesale electricity market This will be the first major wind facility that allows wholesale customers to purchase portions of the wind power production In the past customers interested in purchasing green power were often forced to commit to percent of a projects output over the year life of the equipment Analysis I have suggested before that Texas arguably represents the most active market for wind power in the United States Enrons expansion of its wind power assets in the state should further support the growth of competition of wind power in this market as the state gears up for the sta rt of competition in January Yet while Enron Wind expands its presence in the market and prepares to sell windgenerated electricity on Texas wholesale market several other companies also have established a significa nt presence in the states booming wind power business Enron Wind a subsidiary of Enron Corp has been in existence for about years The company designs and constructs wind power facilities around the world comprising more than wind turbines and MW of capacity According to information from the company Enron Winds manufacturing facilities in California Germany and Spain develop and manufacture stateoftheart wind turbines technology ranging from kW to MW Reportedly Enron Winds MW Series turbine is the largest wind turbine manufactured in the United States and was the first of its size class to be manufactured for the global wind power market The Enron Wind wind turbine utilizes a variable speed constant frequency design and a customdesigned airfoil resulting in enhanced reliability and durability d ue to reduced mechanical loads higher energy capture and lower noise signatur e than conventional fixed speed turbines The new project in Iraan Texas which is still unnamed will consist of Enron Wind MW wind turbines and is expected to be completed by late Enron Wind claims that the project will supply approximately megawa tt hours of clean electricity each year enough to supply the annual residenti al needs of approximately average American homes Enron Wind already has one wind facility operating in Texas which is in fa ct located only miles away from the new facility in Iraan The Indian Mesa I facility is a MW wind power generating facility also located in Pecos County In July Enron Wind entered into a longterm agreement with Ci ty Public Service CPS of San Antonio to provide percent output from the Indian Mesa I facility to the west Texas utility grid Electricity produced from the Indian Mesa I facility reportedly is offered by CPS to individual retail customers such as Windtricityv which is CPS first renewable ene rgy product offering In addition to these two Texas facilities Enron Wind also has developed constructed and operated wind power facilities in Iowa Storm Lake MW Minnesota Lake Benton MW and Lake Benton MW and Californi a Cabazon MW and Green Power MW In all of these facilities Enron Wind has established longterm contracts to sell percent of the electricity generated at the wind facility to a local utility As noted th e new facility being planned in west Texas represents a new approach for Enro n Wind as electricity output from the facility will be sold in portions to a variety of wholesale customers in the Texas market Over the last year there has been a sharp increase in wind power projects in Texas mostly being built in the western part of the state At last report MW of wind generation was already in operation in the state with close to MW recently announced or planned As a result Texas is experiencing a wind boom and is well on its way toward the MW of renewable energy capacity required under the states Renewables Portfolio Standard For example last September TXU Electric Gas a subsidiary of TXU announced an agreement to purchase renewable energy from a planned MW wind farm in west Texas TXU Electric Gas share of the project will be MW The project marked the companys third major purchase of wind powe r energy Earlier in TXU Electric Gas formed a partnership with FPL Energy to build wind turbines south of Odessa Texas which will supply million kWh of electricity per year to approximately homes That project followed similar development in Big Spring Texas including eight wind turbines that are each capable of generating kW of power As an energy supplier TXU Electric Gas has obtained a great deal of its wind power by partnering with FPL Energythe largest generator of wind p ower in the United Stateswhich serves on many of the new projects in west Te xas FPL Energy is a fastgrowing unregulated power producer that is a whollyowned subsidiary of FPL Group Among the more than MW net generating capacity that FPL Energy now has the company focuses on clean technologies Wind power now accounts for about percent of FPL Energys generation portfolio The projects by TXU Electric Gas represented the largest wind power projects in the world until late August when Reliant Energy announced what it claimed to be the worlds largest single wind power installation Reliants wind power project slated to become operational in the fourth quarter of will be located on King Mountain near McCamey in far west Texas Reliant says that the project will be able to produce MW of electricity that will be sold into Texas power grid Note The Reliant wi nd project has now been eclipsed by a joint MW wind project between PacifiCorp and FPL Energy in Walla Walla Wash However I am focused only on the Texas market in this column Thus Enron faces stiff competition when selling its wind power into the Texas wholesale market Enron joins TXU Electric Gas FPL Energy and Reliant as the four companies that are vying to gain a leadership role over the limited areas of the state where the wind blows at speeds of miles per hour or higher the minimum to make a wind project cost effective Why is there so much development related to wind power taking place in Texa s A number of factors are making the state a strong market for wind The firs t factor is nature itself Texas is one of the handful of states along the Su n Belt and Southwest regions that offer an abundance of wind Some reports indicate that average annual wind speeds in west Texas are miles per hou r Second deregulation legislation in the state resulted in the Texas Renewables Portfolio Standard which until the end of is providing a federal tax credit for companies that produce electricity from wind The deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compared to the states that have enacted legislatio n for electric competition The prorenewables stance is perhaps attributed t o the fact that a variety of environmental lobbying groupsincluding the Environmental Defense group and the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Associationwere included in the dialogue when Texas was forming its law In addition more efficient technology has lowered prices for windgenerated electricity while costs associated with natural gas have remained high Ad d all that to the fact that customers in the Lone Star State have a comparatively high desire for wind poweralong with other strong markets such as California Iowa and Minnesota Consequently Texas has proven to be an enticing region for companies like Enron

Wood Distinguishes Texas from California by Susan Kellogg Issues Analyst and Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis In a satellite media event on March Pat Wood the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT introduced the media to a statewide campaign of television advertisements that are part of a kickoff of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program Electric choice begins in Texas on Jun e with the start of a pilot program in which percent of customers served by Texas investorowned utilities can choose their retail electric provider REP Most other customers will be able to choose their REP when fullfledged electric choice begins on Jan After fielding questions from a bevy of television media reporters at the am broadcast Wood conducted an exclusive interview with SCIENTECH Issues Analyst Susan Kellogg on how and why the Texas deregulation plan will work why California didnt and what role the expanding renewables market particularly wind power will play in developing a vibrant competitive energy market in Texas Analysis PUCT Chairman Wood is confident that Texas has done its homework well and the states overall deregulation plan has set the stage for a successful retail competitive market When we think of Texas we think big confident independent However a comprehensive statewide group of stakeholders explored deregulation from all sidesgetting information an d advice from other deregulating states and international sourcesto make sure that Texans have a different experience with electric choice than Californians did The summary of what didnt work in California has circulated in the media for weeks but Wood has an interesting perspective on what complicated the states energy deregulation market Basically Wood says the California market worked pretty well until it stopped raining in California Oregon an d Washington In Woods opinion the fact that California is dependent for onequarter of its power supply on an intermittent source in this case hydroelectric power makes little sense and is largely to blame for the supply demand imbalance still wreaking havoc in the state The lack of power plant investment exacerbated the dynamics of the market when a critic al piece of the power supply dried up last summer Woods criticism of the California mismanagement focused on the its not m y job mentality considering that three state agencies were involved in California deregulation and yet no specific agency seemed to be in charge Bush would have run me out of Texas if we had done anything like that mused Wood Our job is to not only do our job today but to plan for the future to look ahead Granted there had been no power plant investment bu t not looking ahead with accountable facts was an inexcusable critical piece of planning missed by the California Energy Commission The perfect storm of colliding conditions that plunged California into survival mode could have been prevented The whole energy market has a less on to learn says Wood And Texas has an opportunity to practice To counteract the mistakes made Wood freely acknowledges that Texas pirated most of the infrastructure of Texas deregulation bill from Pennsylvanias largely successful plan The Texas legislature meets every t wo years for a day session Right before the session Wood and a deregulation team went to Pennsylvania and visited with state commissioners legislators industry executives consumer groups and customers to find ou t what was working and what was not in the Pennsylvania model What they decided to leave behind from Pennsylvanias overall successful deregulation strategies was the provision that allowed a Philadelphia electric affiliate to go back into Philadelphia and attract the customers away from their own utility in the name of competition Texas goal Wood clarifies is to have a market of unaffiliated companies participating whi ch will hopefully generate genuine longterm competition Yet in contrast to Pennsylvania Texas adopted a policy in which customers that do not opt to switch to a new provider are defaulted to an affiliated REP of their incumbent utility This affiliated REP which cannot be the Toperatio n of the incumbent utility will remain subject to regulated rates in its assign ed service territory although it is allowed to freely compete without price regulation outside of its service territory As a result of this policy Texasbased companies such as Reliant and TXU have submitted multiple applications to the PUCT covering separate subsidiaries that will serve different customer classes and allowing the companies to compete outside of their service territories At last count over companies had filed for certification with the PUCT to be a REP in Texas Companies that plan to be active in the Texas retail market include The New Power Company Green Mountain Energy First Choice Power the competitive spinoff of TexasNew Mexico Power Company TXU Energy Service s Sempra Shell Reliant and Enron Energy Services among others Another Texan invention was the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT the independent power grid that serves the bulk of the state and i s essentially an electrical island in the United States Not possessing multistate jurisdictions has both its advantages and disadvantages Wood sees it being a plus for the Texas energy market because of the ability to monitor the balance of supply and demand of energy flow Another feature of the Texas approach to deregulation is to make the transition easier for both retailers and operators in part by developing a seamless integration between supply and demand Perhaps most significant i s the emergence of wind power and other renewables in the state in part because of a mandate Renewables Credit Exchange that allows a retailer to buy renewable credits from a renewable operator at whatever price they agre e on In addition Texas has established the Texas Renewables Portfolio Standard Until the end of is providing a federal tax credit for companies that produce electricity from wind The deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compare d to the states that have enacted legislation for electric competition Th e key challenge for harnessing wind power in the state is to get the transmission grid to consistently and efficiently transport the power back into the main system There is a high desire for wind power in Texas According to Wood once green power programs were available in the state people jumped on board so fast that the pilot had to be put off a year so enough power supply could b e purchased Wood thinks the demand will certainly outstrip the percent mandate put into place by the state Right now constructing a wind power plant in Texas is actually less expensive than building a more traditionall y fueled power plant An ambitious mandate of having MW of renewable resources by is fueling investors interest sending millions of dollar s to Texas for renewable projects says Wood Will Wood take his lessons and leadership to Washington DC There are two open positions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which is now chaired by Curt Hbert For months it has been rumored that Wood will be appointed by President Bush to assume one of those positions When asked whether he had any potential interest in a role with FERC Wood fielded the question diplomatically Hell leave that decision to the president he said Right now Wood is focused on bringing electric competition to Texas As noted the states pilot program for electric choice begins this June with full competition starting in January With regard to population Texas represents the second largest energy market behind California offering a market value of about billion Thus many eyes within the energy indust ry are anxiously watching to see how deregulation will unfold in the Lone Star State In turn Wood acknowledges that Texas officials have been watching Californ ia closely for the last year and remain confident that the power supply problems faced there wont happen in Texas This is largely because Texas h as avoided making some of the critical mistakes made in California One important distinction between the two states is that Texas regulators have allowed for power plants to be built in about half the construction time th at has been common in other states such as California Since new plan ts have started operations in Texas generating MW By the time competition begins fully in January more plants and MW are scheduled to come online As a result Texas officials say thatunlike Californiatheir state has more than enough generating capacity to meet peak demand and provide at least a percent reserve for the next few years Th e vast majority of these new plants are fueled by natural gas with wind powe r being a supplement In addition there are significant differences between the market structure s in Texas and California First Californias structure is based on an aucti on pool which the state modeled on the United Kingdom Integral to California s system is a Power Exchange into which power suppliers submit power that th ey want to sell on the competitive market Californias PX discouraged a healt hy bilateral contract market from forming because generators could make more money selling into the PX Texas on the other hand has no Power Exchange and in fact has encouraged bilateral contracts as the way in which electric service contracts will take place In Texas customers are encouraged to establish longterm bilateral contracts with suppliers to secure the best rates which introduces the opportunity to protect them from wholesale mark et prices as customers in San Diego discovered this summer The market potential for Texas competition appears very strong which perha ps more than anything else is due to good planning on the part of Texas legislators and regulators However there are still some lingering concern s about competition in the Lone Star State First there is a shortage of transmission lines in Texas especially in the northern half of the state Although PUCT officials say that sufficient transmission lines will be put into place before competition begins without sufficient lines companies could experience transmission congestion Another concern is that Texas may be relying too much on natural gas Almos t all of the new plants that have been built in Texas are powered by this fue l source As the price of natural gas has remained high this could pose a problem for the market in Texas Hedging will be a key part of a successful strategy for any provider in Texas especially considering the rising naturalgas prices Still the espoused advantages of competition ie lower prices for endusers could fall flat if so much emphasis is placed o n natural gas as the primary power source in the state Yet ironically customers may still benefit because of the multitude of power plants within the state Abundant supply in Texas may keep the cost of power low for endusers but less profitable for suppliers Overall though Texas remains the bright shining hope for those who suppor t energy deregulation in this country The size of the states energy market will continue to attract new participants at least on the front end of the restructuring process Whether they remain in Texas and whether or not competition in the state will truly bring benefits to endusers remains to be seen An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most

Pacific Resources Acquisition of Portland General Appears Uncertain by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The probability appears to be getting smaller that Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP will complete its billion acquisition of Portland General Electric NYSE PGB from Enron NYSE ENE Enron disclosed in an K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Feb that the sale of Portland General had been delayed because of recent events in California and Nevada that affected Sierra Pacific Walt Higgins chair and CEO of Sierra Pacific Resources told Wall Street analysts that the acquisition agreement will terminate if it has not closed by May Analysis Yesterday I wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities NU Now another highprofile merger appears to be unraveling As with the Con Edison NU deal the problem facing Sierra Pacific Resources pending purchase of Portland General from Enron is based in economics Namely it appears that Sierra Pacific Resources recent financial problems have cast doubt on the companys ability to complete its purchase of Portland General This is not a good development for Sierra Pacific Resources as the financial and legal implications of this potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the companys current financial problems First let me provide some background on this deal The origin of Sierra Pacific Resources attempt to acquire Portland General date back to November Enron had purchased the company in as a strategic move to facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of California and the Pacific Northwest At the time Enron saw itself as a prototype for the future of the energy industry adding transmission and distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its already successful wholesale marketing core Stymied by the slow start of competition in California and Oregon Enron underwent a transformation in its corporate philosophy Under the growing direction of Jeffrey Skilling Enron no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in the top tier of energy companies That philosophy has served Enron well as its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented Yet Enrons transformation opened the door for Sierra Pacific Resources a relatively small and regionally based holding company to move in for a purchase of Portland General Owning Portland General made more sense for Sierra Pacific Resources than it did for Enron Portland General which provides electric service to over customers in the PortlandSalem area was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help Sierra Pacific Resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fastgrowing states Nevada and Oregon Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to pay Enron billion for Portland General which included billion in cash and assumption of Enrons million merger payment obligation In addition Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to assume billion in Portland General debt and preferred stock taking the total value of the purchase to billion Portland General appeared happy with the scheduled sale from Enron acknowledging that its own core business delivering safe and reliable power with a customer service focus was more in line with Sierra Pacific Resources However a number of economic factors on Sierra Pacific Resources side of the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition As I discussed in the Feb IssueAlert available at wwwconsultrcicom Sierra Pacific Resources reported a significant fourthquarter loss million as a result of soaring costs of power in the western United States The company incurred losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in the volatile wholesale market As a result Sierra Pacific Resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase Without some rate relief the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling our ability to serve the needs of our customers said Mark Ruelle the companys chief financial officer The company attributed the latest quarters loss to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Specifically Sierra Pacific Resources reported a Q loss of million or cents a share This compared with a profit of million or cents a share excluding a million deferred energy writeoff a year ago Including the writeoff the company reported a loss of million or cents a share in Q For yearend the company reported a net loss of million or cents per share a percent drop from In addition the companys stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks at one point dropping percent to on the New York Stock Exchange Feb At the close of trading on March shares of Sierra Pacific Resources were priced at which is still down from its week high of and book value of The drop in stock price could make it difficult for Sierra Pacific Resources to secure the financing necessary to complete the purchase of Portland General Meanwhile Sierra Pacific Resources available cash flow could be impacted by possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants The Public Utility Commission of Nevada PUCN mandated divestiture as a condition of the merger between Nevada Power Co and Sierra Pacific Power Co which created the holding company Sierra Pacific Resources Toward that end the holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public auction of approximately MW of power generation facilities Of Sierra Pacific Resources nine power plants which are mostly fired by natural gas and coal seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as Dynegy and NRG and will be sold upon final regulatory approval However over the last few weeks there has been growing concern that Nevada regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of additional power plants by Sierra Pacific Resources thus preventing the company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of Portland General Perhaps out of fears about depleting the Nevadas power supply the Attorney Generals Bureau of Consumer Protection the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the AFLCIO have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed or canceled Further Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn has called on the PUCN to reconsider the order that required Sierra Pacific Resources to sell the plants owned by its two utilities Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Any available cash that Sierra Pacific Resources was planning to use from the power plant sales to support its acquisition of Portland General may not materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated Ironically Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Co just received approval from the PUCN to secure billion in bank loans bond financing and preferred securities However due to agreements that the utilities previously made none of the borrowed money may be used directly or indirectly to financially support its parents acquisition of Portland General Thus Sierra Pacific Resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place regarding this purchase which it apparently still wants to complete It would appear that Sierra Pacific Resources will have difficulty financing the purchase of Portland General due to the combination of its significant financial losses plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the sale of its power plants Presumably these are the recent events to which Enron referred in its SEC filing It is fairly clear that Enron no longer wishes to own Portland General and believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing growth What remains in question however is what will happen if Sierra Pacific Resources pending acquisition is not completed by the May deadline thus terminating the sales agreement The problems associated with the Con Edison NU merger are leading to litigation One cant help but think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the Enron Portland General Sierra Pacific Resources case as well as Enron presumably would seek to be compensated in some way for the billion that the deal includes Further complicating matters for Sierra Pacific Resources is a growing movement to municipalize the electric markets in Las Vegas and Henderson Nev On Jan the Southern Nevada Water Authority suggested that the agency could become a public power authority Pat Mulroy general manager of the water authority recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants to serve cities in the area Efforts to municipalize electric systems in the southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if Sierra Pacific Resources financial problems worsen An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive

IssueAlert for March California May Be Headed for Another Volatile Summer How Much Power Is Needed to Save the State by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Unless Gov Gray Davis arranges significantly more longterm electricity contracts or convinces people to turn off a lot more lights Californias unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc again this summer Ev en with the longterm deals announced by Davis on March up to percent of the states daily needs may have to be bought on the highly volatile spot market where power is purchased a day ahead of when it is needed That cou ld prove hugely expensive for the state because if this past years spot mark et prices are an indicator then California might see spot market prices at fi ve to six times more costly than what they would be under the longterm contracts Analysis Despite the somewhat reassuring announcements that the state of California has lined up various new longterm contracts for the supply of power it remains questionable if the power secured in the contracts will b e enough to prevent another long hard summer for the state and its residents In fact some predictions suggest that summer could be just as bad or worse as summer leading to another series of rolling blackouts and spikes in spot market prices To date California has spent upwards of million a day a total of billion since January to buy electricity on the spot market The longterm contracts in which the state has engaged are intended to lock in cheaper prices and cut down the amount of electricity the state has to buy in the volatile shortterm market On March Gov Davis announced that the state of Californiathrough th e Department of Water Resources DWR the newly appointed power purchasing agencyhas agreed to power purchase contracts with more than gener ators and marketers which will supply an average of MW per year over the next years The contracts varying in length from four months to year s and worth billion in total reportedly will provide the state with a diversified longterm power portfolio said Davis in an announcement According to a report in Megawatt Daily the average price of the deals is MWh over the entire year period For the first five years the avera ge price will be MWh dropping to MWh for the period between and Gov Davis has offered that these prices are between and percen t lower than recent spot market prices although they are higher than the original goal of MWh that Davis had established when he first began to negotiate longterm contracts In a noticeable omission the governor has refused to identify exactly how much power from longterm contracts will be available to the state this summer There has been a string of announcements regarding the longterm contracts so we know some of the companies that are entering into agreements with the state For instance Calpine Corp locked the DWR into a year contra ct for the sale of approximately MW of electricity California will be paying a fixed price for the power it buys from Calpine but most reports have placed the value of the deal in the range of billion Dynegy and NRG Energy said that they have agreed to sell up to MWenough to p ower about million homesto the DWR under contracts lasting through According to the companies their California generating affiliatesEl Se gundo Power LLC Long Beach Generation LLC and Cabrillo Iwill provide up to MW of power to the state from today through the rest of increasing deliveries of MW from Jan Mirant Corp formerly Southern Energy announced an agreement to shift MW in power contracts from th e California Power Exchange to the states DWR These are just a few examples among other companies such as Avista Duke Enron PacifiCorp and Williams that have signed on to serve the state unde r longterm contracts Absent from the list is Reliant Energy which reportedly is in negotiations with the DWR but reluctant to commit to more than a day contract to sell power to the state Reliant is owed over million for power delivered to Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE in November and December The two major utilitie s owe more than billion to powergenerating companies and cant buy more having no credit or cash to make the purchases which is what prompted to t he state to appoint the DWR into the power purchasing role Gov Davis has said With these deals in place Californias energy future is looking a whole lot brighter But is it really That is the question of the hour Representatives for the governor have indicated that the longter m contracts will reduce the states need to purchase power on the spot market over the next years by about percent Yet of more immediate concern to analysts is what will transpire during the fastapproaching summer heat wh en demand increases This represents a quite precarious scenario the start of which is only about two months away Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles on March Davis said state DWR negotiators have so far been able to meet between and percent of the states power needs for the coming summer based on last summers consumption The governor again called on residents to cut usage by percent over last year Despite the tempered optimism associated with these announced longterm contracts the general consensus is that however much power Gov Davis has lined up for this summer it wont be enough In fact when pressed for details about how muc h power would be available this summer Davis conceded that the state will still have to buy to percent of its power on the expensive shortterm market As noted the longterm contracts that have been established thus far vary in length from four months to years However when doing the math for the anticipated summer season the calculation of what will be needed versus wh at will be available paints a pretty alarming picture During the month of Augusttypically the hottest month in Californiapeak daily demand fo r power in the California ISO territory is expected to hit about MW The states three IOUsPGE SCE and San Diego Gas Electricstill gener ate about MW from their remaining power plants and have longterm contrac ts from wind solar and other energy sources that gains them an additional MW of power Gov Davis has established that about MW from the longterm contracts will be available this summer In addition back in February Davis announced a plan to expedite new power plants in the state which he promised would bring MW online by July an ambitious goal th at may or may not materialize Altogether assuming that all of these projections are reliable the total comes to about MW that we know should be available in California this summer leaving the state about MW short for its power supply needs Gov Davis may continue to secure longterm contracts with other power suppliers Or then again he may not be able to do so Most of the promine nt power suppliers operating in the United States have already signed deals wi th the DWR and are included in the MW that is already expected for the summer Thus there is a strong chance that the bulk of the MW neede d by California will have to be bought on the spot market where prices are projected to remain high at least through the beginning of next year Reportedly just within the last week last minute prices on Californias spot market averaged MWh compared to MWh which is the average of the longterm contracts Some officials including Gov Davis have said that now more than ever conservation in California is critical Representatives of the governor hav e suggested that if Californians reduce their electricity usage by percent conservation efforts across the state could reduce peak demand by nearly MW Or perhaps a traditional rain dance would be in order California is due f or a cooler summer season after the two previous summers that were unseasonabl y warm A rainy season would bring cooler temperatures to the state and thus drive down the anticipated demand for the summer which is based on last years load If the state is fortunate enough to receive a rainy season or otherwise coolerthanexpected summer then the state could squeak by with enough power supply resources to accommodate anticipated demand If summer is another unseasonably warm one for the state the plan that is presently in place sounds like a blueprint for another volatile and expensi ve summer for California An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American Power

Energy Spending Expected by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Knight Ridder Washington Bureau March Days after telling the nation th at theres a real energy crisis and vowing to promote alternative energy sources and conservation President Bush is proposing a budget that would reduce federal spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy by as muc h as a third and increase funding for oil and naturalgas drilling Bush proposes to cut the Department of Energys renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by to percent according to Energy Department and White House officials who have briefed energy and environmental lobbyists The presidents proposed Energy Department budget is another indication tha t the administration will emphasize increasing oil naturalgas and coal production more than cutting energy demand or developing alternatives to fossil fuels Analysis During his presidential campaign President Bush was critical of Bill Clinton for failing to adopt a national energy policy Facing unavoidable problems within the nations energy industryincluding the ongoing California problem supply concerns across the country and predictions of several more years of erratic electricity naturalgas and o il pricesBush has been on a fast track to develop his own comprehensive en ergy strategy More than likely the president is still weeks away from unveilin g his official energy plan However the word circulating through Washington DC and the energy industry as a whole is that his plan will emphasize increasing oil natural gas and coal production by giving unique financial incentives to producers and deemphasize conservation efforts and renewabl e energies Given the fact that President Bushs energy plan has not yet been released analysis of the proposed plan is still based on speculation at this point While many opponents of the proposed plan are quick to criticize anticipate d cuts for energy efficiency and renewable energy Bush has not indicated tha t these approaches will not have a role in his administrations strategy It is important to keep in mind that while funding for efficiency and renewables may indeed be reduced there is still is a budget for these technologies in the Department of Energy Bush may believe that the time has now come to le t market forces support further growth of renewable energies such as wind and solar while he searches for a more immediate solution to the significant problems facing the energy industry According to the Knight Ridder report Energy Department spokesperson Joe Davis expects that there will be cuts associated with the departments billion budget in an effort to deal with belttightening In fact Bushs proposed billion DOE budget is million less than what the departme nt now spends Reportedly the cuts are being made so that the president can boost spending on clean coal technology to make the fossil fuel more efficient and less harmful to the environment Rumors of Bushs budget cuts for renewable energy and conservation efforts have sparked an immediate outcry from environmental groups and leaders with in the Democratic Party For instance New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee went on record in disagreement with the proposed cuts Clearly if we dont dedicate adequate resources to research and development for energy efficiency we lose our ability to benefit from this technology Bingaman said Renewable energy supporters point to the fact that the clean coal technolog y program already in place still has about million in unspent funding despite the fact that it has produced few usable results In addition conservation advocates refer to a report concluding that the Department of Energys conservation program has already saved billion and quadrillion Btus of energy The overall consensus of the groups that oppose Bushs expected spending cuts is that now more than ever spending for renewable energy and conservation programs should be increased not cut It has already been well established that President Bush supports opening u p federally protected lands for increased oil and naturalgas drilling The president has made no secret of his intention to move forward with the controversial step to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR in Alaska The Bush administration is pushing to open and develop for drilling percent of ANWR which consists of million tundra acres and spans miles along the Arctic Ocean Throughout his campaign President Bush reiterated that he would make this move a point on which he differed sharp ly from Al Gore who maintained that he would keep the land protected For som e time it was expected that Bushs energy plan would also include expanded conservation efforts and increased funding for alternative fuels However according to Bushs team the short answer to the electricity shortage that has rocked California and put fear into the rest of the country is to increase domestic supplies of natural gas coal and oil all of which can be used to run power plants As another action plan President Bush has argued that the United States needs to become more autonomous when it comes to meeting its energy needs The Bush administration has claimed that the United States has become too dependent on foreign sources of oil especially when there are abundant reserves that can be processed domestically Yet its also important to no te that President Bush has never suggested that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will be sufficient Rather the president recognizes that acces s to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States and the global economy However instead of relying predominantly on the Middle East Bush will wor k more closely with Canada and Mexico to increase crossborder flows of oil natural gas and electricity within North America Toward that end Bush has asked Mexicos President Vincente Fox to help by allowing private US capital to build electricity plants and transmission lines in Mexico that would send power north This has been a rather contentious issue in Mexico a country that has had a longstanding history of stateowned electricity Pa st proposals to privatize or allow even minimal levels of private investment i n Mexico have been widely denounced Fox has responded that Mexico is having trouble meeting its own power needs let alone being able to send power to the United States However Fox has agreed to work with President Bush on establishing a regional energy plan between the two countries with the objective of providing enough power to fuel their growing economies Running concurrent to Bushs proposed energy plan is a comprehensive energy bill reportedly being developed by Senate Republicans under the leadership of Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski a Republican from Alaska The bill appears to be a mirror image of the policies expected in Bushs energy plan including drilling in the ANWR and also tax breaks offered to the oil industry For instance the measure reportedly would gra nt oil producers operating on federal lands a break on their royalty payments to the government along with granting federal royalty relief for producers operating in deep waters and difficult formations such as tight rocks and coal beds In addition the bill would require that federal agencies such a s the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Interior Department confi rm with the Energy Secretary before taking any action that would have a significant effect of reducing domestic energy supply Of course earlier this month the US Supreme Court granted extended power to the EPA to regulate emissions from utility power plants along with othe r industries In one of the most important environmental and business decisio ns in decades the Supreme Court rejected industry arguments that the federal government must consider cost and not just health benefits in setting national air pollution standards Largely rejecting arguments by business groups the Supreme Court said that the EPA has the power to issue new standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air Prior to this ruling it was suggested that President Bush was also considering relaxing some environmental standards to allow electrical plants to expand capacity It is unknown at this point whether or not Bush will still go in this direction considering that the Supreme Court unanimously sided with t he EPAs authority in these matters Moreover it may be premature to draw any conclusions about President Bush s energy plan until the official strategy is released and we can assess specific numbers I have not seen anything that would indicate that the president does not support a significant role for renewable energies such a s wind and solar along with increased conservation efforts In fact recall that Bush was an active participant in the Texas restructuring legislation in which the Renewables Portfolio Standard requires that approximately percent of fuel generation comes from renewable sources In fact the deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compared to the states that have enacted legislatio n for electric competition Consequently during his tenure as Governor of Texas President Bush demonstrated support for alternative forms of energy However as demand continues to outpace supply on a national basis the president appears to be looking for an immediate solution which more than likely will give priority to largescale production plants efforts includin g coal natural gas and nuclear In the next few weeks when President Bushs energy plan is formally released it may very well emerge that his administration proposes a more balanced approach to the nations energy needs which still includes conservation efforts and exploration of renewab le energies An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American Power System b y RDIFT Energy is now

SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March Dissension at FERC Commission Divided On Price Caps Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters March The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout s and price spikes The three FERC commissioners who regulate interstate electricity markets testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts Analysis Since the start of deregulation in the early s FERCs variou s positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent Despite its changing members as a whole the fivemember commission with two positions currently open has taken a handsoff approach to its regulatory role preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry In fact Curt Hbert appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe n FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether However significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker A s the federal regulatory body for the energy industry FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country Th e debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu re leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt At the House of Representatives meeting on March Hbert a Republican reiterated his objections to price caps Chairman Hbert has maintained his longstanding opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do longterm damage In January Hbert told me I have seen no evidence th at price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level Hbert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other shortterm resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California Reuters reported that Hbert said at the hearings that such controls are n ot a longterm solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West Rather Hbert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants both in California and elsewhere Hbert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand thus correcting the current imbalance Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect Despite Hberts opposition to wholesale price caps fellow Commissioner William Massey a Democrat asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary time out or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju st and reasonable rates Massey said In addition Massey reportedly also sai d that such a price cap could be calculated on a generatorbygenerator basi s at each generators variable operating cost plus a reasonable capacity adder perhaps in the range of per megawatt hour Massey reiterated th e severity of the crisis in California noting that whereas wholesale power i n the state cost billion in it increased to billion in and could exceed billion for Rounding out the commissions divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt a Democrat who said that all possible options should be analyze d and debated Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric e controls Chairman Hberts stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investmen t in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power produce rs to other regions of the country and further away from California The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps Abraham said Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin g is scheduled for later this week Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton a Texas Republican noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o r not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE RC over major issues facing the energy industry The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs FERCs December vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated ThenCommissioner Hbert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT O met FERC guidelines for RTO formation and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO However Hbert stood as a minority The other three commissioners at FERC at the time Hoecker Massey and Breathitt preferred to wield a tight er regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy While Hbert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti es and letting free market principles rule the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities Meanwhile speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to the position of FERC chairman Hbert was named chairman in February by Preside nt Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan At that time the president did not indicate that Hberts appointment as chair was temporary Wood was appoint ed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in and played a primary role i n the development of that states restructuring plan Electric choice begins in Texas on June with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate d There are two Republican openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush As noted presently Hbert is the only Republican among the current three members Wood reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time However the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman forcing Hbert to step back into a role as commissioner The report in Reuters indicated that Hbert a friend and protg of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss is personally fighting the planned move The nomination would require Senate confirmation Moreover as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC th e issue of price caps remains unresolved The debate over price caps also has divided others involved strictly along party lines Generally speaking Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha t has been called price gouging on the part of energy companies Republica ns believe that the government including FERC and the Bush administration should maintain a handsoff approach and allow the marketplace to determi ne prices Speaking from a nonpartisan point of view some economists now question whetherand not just howderegulation of electricity markets should occur at all For instance Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economis t who helped deregulate other industries says that electricity markets may n ot lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities allowing a single regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity The movemen t toward reregulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps Yet in any event once again California remains the catalyst for decisionmaking on this issue As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in to a third day in the state federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country As the industrys top agency in charge of wholesale markets FERCs ultimate position on price ca ps carries tremendous influence Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b e conducted or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in

IssueAlert for March New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies Plans for New Power Plant by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Sithe Energies Inc announced that in respon se to issues raised by local residents the company is reassessing its plans f or a power generating facility in Ramapo New York The alternative currently under review is a smaller peaking facility which would use no water for generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure reliability of the regions electricity supply Originally slated as an MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga s the alternative plant is a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas Analysis Sithe Energies original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav e been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant Ramapo is located miles north of New York City Chief amon g the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes In response to the concerns of residents Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output Unfortunately Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t he very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has some rather serious power supply concerns For background it is important to note that Exelon Corp owns nearly half of Sithe Energies In December Exelon acquired percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi percent Marubeni Corp percent and Sithe Management percent The acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon Jim McGowan Sithe senior vice president for development referenced the ro le that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki ng unit in the area Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed McGowan said Weve listened carefully to residents concern s and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean less visible and uses no water for generation McGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil e fulfilling the regions growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand As an independent power producer Sithe Energies owns power plants across t he United States and internationally The company has a generation presence in such states as California Colorado Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania among several others In New York Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately M W Batavia MW Independence Station Scriba NY MW Massena MW Ogdensburg MW and Sterling Sherill NY MW In addition t o the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station an MW power plant located near Lake Ontario A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete However projects under MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement which generally involves a detailedand time consumingexamination of alternatives The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further Ne w York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum heightened by the ongoing problems in California Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies Ramapo plant which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t o generate power While other new plants are being planned in New York realistically it will be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit y to ease concerns about shortages Meanwhile the state enters this summers season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands Ne w York City like other areas of the Northeast the Midwest and California i s in a very serious situation reported a member of the New York Public Service Commission to the New Assembly While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November FERC report entitled Investigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlights specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study says Li ke northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti es of power on constrained transmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densel y populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes i s generated by the city New plants are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be MW short of its required MW generating capacit y needs this summer That projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added This years demand is expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts According to the FERC report New York City s load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incit y capacity along with imports to meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall Long Island has a potential MW shortfall to meet the required MW of power The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with in the next few months the state could suffer some of Californias problems However despite the need for additional power generation in the state the intense public scrutiny of Sithes plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants throughout the state For instance the New York Power Authoritys NYPA plan to install ten MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi on from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group NYIRG which has sued the NYPA charging that it circumvented the environmental review process for siting new plants In addition FERCs report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were approximately projects proposed to be built in New York State as of November The report indicated that only one of these projects is likely to be built in the next three to four years Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit McGowan has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy requirements If it does it will make the same mistakes for which Californ ia is now paying a tremendous price Along the same lines William Muesler CE O of the New York ISO recently said that to avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown New York must move quickly to build more powe r plants Muesler cited that MW of new power plant capacity percent more than is currently available must be constructed in New York by o r shortages will become likely pushing up prices and increasing the odds of rolling blackouts However despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants not in my back yard has been a common response in New York Even New Jerseys acting Governor Donald T DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos e opposing new power plants in the region DiFrancesco reportedly told a meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th at he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec ts in New York and New Jersey Included in the task force are members of DiFrancescos own staff the state Department of Environmental Protection a nd the Attorney Generals Office Moreover although California offers a clear picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate supply New York appears to be heading down a similar path Although California and New York have different restructuring models one market factor is the same in both states supply that cannot meet demand We know the toll that this inequity has had on California Is it only a matter of time before New York suffers the same consequences An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

of electricity and naturalgas marketing giant Enron Corp NYSE ENE slid further on Thursday March amid broader weakness in energy stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year Enro n was off or percent at on March after falling percent on March So far this year Enrons stock is down about percent vers us a percent decline for Standard Poors utilities index and a percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average Analysis Over the last several weeks a growing number of smaller emergin g energy companies have felt the impact from the nations struggling economy and the likelihood of an impending recession Just recently startup companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have withdrawn their IPO plans citing an anemic stock market and the lack of positive cash flow A look across the stock market can send shivers down th e spines of most energy company CEOs as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below the point for the first time in two years and the Nasd aq composite remains percent off of its March high of putting the economy in bear market territory However while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies may crash and burn the giant energy company that is Enron Corp typically has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the US economy Over the course of Enron shares returned percent and traded at roughly times trailing earnings reportedly more than times the multiple of its some of its main competitors or the S Nevertheless Enrons winning streak in the stock market may be eroding as the waves that are crashing around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same whirlpool For perspective Enrons closest competitors across its various business lines Williams and Dynegy also appear to be taking the hit from the bear market Williams NYSE WMB saw its stock decline or percent to on March Dynegy NYSE DYN saw its stock drop or percent to Of course of the three companies Enron wields the highest PE ratio at and largest market capitalization at billion By comparison Williams has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion while Dynegy has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion Analysts that keep a close eye on Enrons stock say the sudden decline is n ot a reflection of any new business developments at the company but rather a market that is struggling in general and a growing disenchantment among investors in technology and telecommunications in particular This may be having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron g stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the telecommunications broadband market Just as the company has achieved unparalleled success in electricity and naturalgas trading for the last year Enron has been developing a highspeed broadband communications networ k to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing Enron projects a billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi ng and services by and the valuation of its own broadband business at a share or billion The company plans to trade excess bandwidth capacity and in order to do so is constructing its own network which cost s a lot of money Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between billion and billion in assets over the next months in order to reduce debt and support the new business in broadband among other businesses in pulp and paper data storage and advertising Thus much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business and Enrons role in it Up to this point confidence in both the industry a nd the company have run high Some analysts have reported that interest in Enrons expansion into this area validated by investor interest in new technologies in general drove an percent rise in the companys share price last year Yet once again the tide may be turning Investors no longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not resulted in bottomline profits much as the year before ecommerce stocks also found that their day in the sun ended rather abruptly And although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold its broadband business has remained immature In fact for yearend Enron Broadband Services reported a million IBIT loss reflecting start up costs to build the new business The company seems to have anticipated the slow growth of its broadband business In fact Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a nd six years for the companys naturalgas business to develop standardized contracts and increase liquidity Skilling has said that these numbers do n ot dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe r for the company While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t he broadband business investors may not be as patient Note that while Enron s broadband business took a loss for the company as a whole reported a percent increase in earnings per diluted share to and a percent increase in net income to billion In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for to between and per share In response to the sudden drop in stock price an d speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom e profitable Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it remains ver y comfortable with the earnings estimate An Enron spokesperson also ma de references to information in the market that is inaccurate suggesting th at any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded including potential layoffs at the broadband unit According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom investors polled by First Call Thompson Financial ar e still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of to for Nevertheless despite Enrons reassurances that it remains on track to meet its earnings estimate the companys stock continued to drop As noted investors began to put downward pressure on the stock pushing it to as of March below its week low of and far below its week hi gh of Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai n unclear about what it is that Enron does exactly According to a March article in Fortune magazine entitled Is Enron Overpriced some Wall Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money and the lack of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enrons pricey stock The skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enrons thunder in a bull market b ut that could all change quickly in a bear market Enron may in fact exacerbat e Wall Streets distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its financial records for what it deems competitive reasons The Fortune report which was published before Enrons stock began to decline also indicated that investors are concerned about Enrons debt Although the company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load Enron carried a net billion debt at the end of September Again although investor s may have been able to look the other way from Enrons debt during a strong economy it appears that investors will use a finetooth comb to examine th e companys financial records during the increasingly unstable economy Moreover in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog y and telecommunications stocks investors may also be concerned that a globa l economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole resulting in lower commodity prices Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly validate this theory Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of problems with its broadband unit Looking at the big picture it appears reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i n Enrons stock Rather Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o f several factors Yes investors appear to now be less likely to support new technologies and telecommunications businesses that have not proven to be presently profitable In addition Enron is in many ways an enigma In an unstable economy the uncertainty surrounding Enrons business could prompt an unprecedented hesitation about the companys business model And lastly Enron is not alone among energy stocks and stocks in general that are weathering the fallout of the stock market On the bright side Enron still remains a very puissant company despite the sudden drop in its stock price Enrons PE ratio of is still quite strong when compared against othe r energy companies In addition Enron is a company full of surprises and it is doubtful that any temporary drop in its stock price will keep the compan y down for long An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

chairman and CEO of Baltimorebased Constellation Energy Group NYSE CEG announced that it will create two pure play energy companies midtolate this year to focus exclusively on the North American wholesale market and regional retail energy services in Maryland and the surrounding region Both entities will become publicly traded companies before the end of the year Constellation Energy Group is a holdi ng company that includes a group of competitive energy businesses focused most ly on power marketing and merchant generation in North America plus Baltimore Gas Electric BGE a regulated energy company in Central Maryland In Constellation reported combined revenues of billion and total assets of billion Analysis Constellations plan to separate into two publicly traded compani es has been in the works for over a year In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its unregulated merchant energy business wholesale power marketing and generation operations and the other focused on retail services including the regulated electric and gas utility BGE As part of this process Constellation combined its diverse generation portfolio power plant operations and development efforts with its energy marketing and trading organization The company has clearly stated that the primary reason for bifurcating its operations is to enhance shareholder value Constellation has said that the separation of the businesses will illuminate the specific investment advantages of each emerging company and allow investors to make decisions based on a clearer assessment of each companys balance of risk and return Upon separation the holding company of the merchant energy businesses will retain the Constellation Energy Group name The holding company of the reta il services businesses will become BGE Corp Current shareholders will own shares in each company when the transactions are completed In addition th e Constellation board of directors has approved a move to allow Goldman Sachs to become an equity owner of up to percent in the unregulated business Goldman Sachs has been a partner with Constellation since providing risk management and power marketing services The split of the business can be seen as primarily benefiting Constellation s unregulated operations which provide the real moneymaking opportunities f or the company In return the high growth of the unregulated businesses and i ts new status as a standalone company is expected to benefit Constellation shareholders Constellation Energys merchant energy business is made up primarily of the following subsidiaries Constellation Power Source Incwholesale power marketing and trading Constellation Power Source Generation Inc which has ownership of foss il and hydroelectric power plants formerly owned by BGE Constellation Power Inc and subsidiariesdevelopment and management of existing power plants throughout the United States and Constellation Nuclear LLC and subsidiariesnuclear generation and consulting Poindexter has said that delivering solutions to the companys wholesale customers is the foundation of Constellations business as opposed to the more traditional operations found on the regulated side Further the companys primary growth strategies center on the nonregulated domestic merchant energy business with the objective of providing new sources of earnings growth The company is planning to divest generation assets in international markets such as Latin America and focus exclusively on its unregulated businesses in the United States Toward that end Constellation has focused over the last year on aggressive ly building its generation portfolio Currently the company controls more tha n MW of power capacity and over the course of this year plans to add MW of gasfired peaking capacity as well as complete a recently announced acquisition of MW of the Nine Mile Point nuclear facility i n New York The goal for the merchant energy business according to Poindexte r is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Up until this point Constellations generation assets have been primarily based in a mixture of coal and nuclear and for the mos t part located in the Northeastern United States According to information directly from the company itself Constellations own fuel mix is predominantly coal percent followed by nuclear percent Oil gas and hydro only represent a small percentage percent of Constellations fuel mix However moving forward it is expected that nuclear power will play an increasingly important role in Constellations competitive strategy Constellations merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth Revenues in Constellations unregulated businesses totaled billion for yearend almost half of the tota l revenues for the company Segment earnings for reflected a shift in earnings from the regulated utility business to the nonregulated domestic merchant energy business as a result of the transfer of BGEs electric generation assets to nonregulated subsidiaries on July Constellation believes that a reasonable range for earnings per share on a total company basis is to More than twothirds of the total earnings is expected to come from the domestic merchant energy business wi th the remainder coming from BGE and the other businesses that will comprise t he new BGE Corp as part of the business separation strategy Meanwhile BGE remains a consistent performer and in fact contributed the majority of Constellations revenues over the course of billion out of a total of billion BGEs fourth quarter electric sales volume s increased nearly percent as compared to This increase in the fourth quarter helped to offset a portion of the decline in electric sales experienced during the summer of BGE will remain a regulated provider of gas and electricity delivery services in central Maryland However as a regulated entity Constellation apparently believes that BGE will not provi de the same level of profit potential as the unregulated merchant business an d therefore the company wants to attract two different sets of investors FERC approved Constellations separation plan in early March The company still needs to receive approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Internal Revenue Service Also related to Constellations separation process is a change in the companys common stock dividend policy effective in April At that tim e Constellations annual dividend is expected to be set at per share After the separation BGE Corp expects to pay initial annual dividends of per share Constellation Energy Group as a growing merchant energy company initially expects to reinvest its earnings in order to fund its growth plans and not to pay a dividend Constellations strategy falls into a growing trend among energy companies attempting to streamline their businesses for competitive markets For instance last fall American Electric Power NYSE AEP announced its plans to restructure into two companies to support a new focus on power generatio n marketing and trading Under the restructuring one corporation will hold AEPs utility and nonutility subsidiaries whose revenues are derived from competitive unregulated business ventures The second corporation will ho ld AEPs utility subsidiaries primarily Tsubsidiaries that are subject to regulation by at least one state regulatory commission or foreign subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs regulation It is not clear if AEP will opt to take both companies public Linn Draper AEPs CEO has said th at the company is reserving that decision until the end of the time at which he believes the restructuring will have received all the necessary regulatory approvals In addition just yesterday Mirant NYSE MIR completed its spinoff from parent Southern Company and is now recognized as a fully independent publicly traded company Mirant is a global competitive energy company with a leading position in both power generation and energy risk management and marketing With an integrated business model Mirant develops constructs owns and operates power plants and sells wholesale electricity natural gas and other energy commodities Other parent companies that have announced the spinoff of unregulated generation companies into standalone and possibly publicly traded companie s include UtiliCorp Reliant and Xcel Energy As noted the common driver behind the growing trend of spinning off highrisk highgrowth ventures into standalone companies is the hope of attracting two sets of investors For instance lets take a look at the Southern Company Mirant example as Mirant has just completed its spinoff from Southern Southern Companys PE multiple is compared to Mirant s The price earnings ratio is typically used to gauge a firms measure of value and can be used to compare a company to its peers and industry average The average PE ratio of a traditional utility company is somewher e around A PE ratio much higher than the average signals that the company has a highrisk highreward profile However the general consensu s is that the traditional utility investor does not have the riskappetite fo r an IPPtype company The IPP stock carries more risk than the average utili ty and does not guarantee a dividend payment On the other hand with risk com es reward Consequently companies such as Southern Constellation and the others mentioned are finding that by splitting nonregulated and regulated businesses they can attract two different sets of investors and safeguard any possible negative earnings impact that might spill over from one side o f the business to the other An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility

Sale of Generation Plants ReRegulation Now Likely for State by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from California Energy Markets Nevada officials rushed through measures designed to stop the sale of power plants by Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power with a total value estimated at billion The Nevada Assembly voted to pass Assembly Bill which halts the plant sales and stops restructuring in the state Analysis For the last several weeks Nevada officials monitoring the energ y industry in the state have oscillated between assisting the financially strapped utilities under parent company Sierra Pacific Resources or preventing what they fear will be a repeat of the California energy crisis The measure taken late last week by the Nevada Assembly is essentially an attempt to ensure costbased rates in the state reduce the potential risk of summer blackouts and wait out the uncertainty surrounding power supply and electricity prices in the West However the measure does little to allevia te the financial burden weighing on Nevadas major utility companies and in fact raises the possibility for further debts that Sierra Pacific and Nevad a Power may have to carry to comply with several of the measures related requirements The key provision of Assembly Bill blocks the sale of power plants befo re July although Nevada utilities will be allowed to apply to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada PUCN for plant sales that include a state of substantial financial emergency after July The measure directly impacts a pending sale to AES Corp of a percent interest MW in the Mohave Generating Station located in Laughlin Nev that is presently owned by Nevada Power AES had agreed to pay million for t he percent interest in the plant Under terms of the states restructuring legislation Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power were ordered to sell the ir power plants to alleviate concerns about market power Toward that end the holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a publi c auction of approximately MW of power generation facilities Of Sierra Pacific Resources nine power plants which are mostly fired by natural gas and coal seven had been entered into sales agreements and were awaiting final approval when this Assembly measure was passed The PUCN had actually approved the sale of the Mohave plant last year representing the first sales transactions of one of the utilities plants However since th e PUCN granted its approval of the Mohave plant Nevada officials have grown increasingly concerned about instability in the Western power markets and t he power supply problems in California Tom Hay chief of the Nevada Attorney Generals Bureau of Consumer Protection initiated the block against the sale out of concern about power supply in the state Specifically Hay proposed that the Mohave plant shoul d remain under the control of Nevada Power for the time being because it burn s coal a lowcost fuel that can be relied upon to stave off blackouts in the state In addition Hay raised the concern that should the sale of the pla nt be approved the new owner AES could decide to sell the power produced by t he plant outside of the state after a twoyear buy back agreement expires in By keeping the Mohave and other generating plants under the ownership of Nevada utilities state officials believe that they can retain regulator y control over the price of power Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn agreed that the plants should not be sold at th is time and said that keeping the plants would protect Nevadans against high prices on the wholesale power markets Guinn also expressed his intention t o block restructuring in the state throughout his term as governor which end s in If he is elected for a second term and can see that the markets ha ve stabilized in the West Guinn said he would consider allowing competition i n the state sometime after For its part AES says that it will seek legal action to force the sale of the plant to proceed AES argues that the Nevada Assemblys measure is not constitutional and violates the sales contract already approved by the PUCN AES also pointed out that the Mohave plant is years old and will require significant repairs and improvement an investment that it was willing to make but one that would cause an unnecessary financial burden on Nevada Power Moreover the negative financial impact that the Nevada Assemblys measure might cause is a major point of contention for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific along with the two Assembly members who voted against the measure A spokesperson for the utilities said pending sales of power plants would provide the two companies with about billion in cash which would go a long way to help us buy fuel and purchase power As I discussed in my IssueAlert the utilities parent company Sierra Pacific Resources continues to struggle financially so much so that a pending acquisition of Portland General has now been scrapped Sierra Pacific Resources reported a significant fourthquarter loss million as a result of soaring cost s of power in the western United States The company incurred losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in th e volatile wholesale market The company attributed the latest quarters los s to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Although the Nevada Assemblys measure passed with a vote one assembly member recognized the fact that if we weaken the utilities to the point where they cant borrow to purchase fuel we wont have power Consequentl y the state could still find itself with a compromised power supply despite its efforts to retain state control over existing power plants Additional financial burden could be placed on Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific as a result of other requirements that are included in related Assembly measures For instance AB calls for gradually increasing the amount of green power used by the utilities to percent from its current percent The bill allows for the PUCN to fine the utilities a day or a total of million for failing to buy the required amount of renewable energy Although a representative of Sierra Pacific Resources sai d that the company supports the use of renewable power the Assembly measure s requirement was considered so much so quick so fast The block on the power sales and indefinite delay in the start of competiti on essentially returns Nevada to a reregulated state This is another example of the continuing fallout that has resulted from the California energy crisis especially among neighboring states in the West As another example New Mexico recently decided to also delay the start of competition until Western states which in one way or another have felt the direct impa ct of the power crunch in California have become more cautious about deregulation and seemingly are in no hurry to open their markets to competition despite the fact that deregulation proceeds in other areas of the country However unlike California where the state government now has an active ro le in purchasing power and may take over the utilities transmission assets Nevada Gov Guinn has expressed no interest in having the state or local governments take over the jobs of electric utility companies Rather Guinn merely wants to retain the control that the state traditionally has had ove r setting utility costbased rates an authority that would become diluted if outofstate power companies own generation assets located in Nevada Further Guinn wants to return to deferred energy rates also known as fueladjustment clauses in which a utility is allowed to seek dollarfordollar adjustments in rates to recover costs associated with purchasing power on the wholesale market As opposed to monthly rate increases Guinn believes that an annual rate increasewhich Nevada Powe r and Sierra Pacific would have to request and justifywould smooth out the u ps and downs of power and fuel costs over the year In addition Guinn believ es that the combination of state regulation and costbased rates offers a bett er strategy for the state than attempting retail competition at this time To supplement power supply Guinn believes that Nevada should promote the use of merchant plants rather than relying on the incumbent utilities to build additional generation Moreover the Nevada Assembly measure brings competition in the state to a screeching halt at least for the next few years However the larger issu e at hand presently is the precarious financial state of Sierra Pacific Resources and its utilities Without the cash that would have been gained from the sales of its power plants it is unclear how Sierra Pacific Resources will be able to pull itself out of debt The utility already received an emergency rate increase last month so any attempt to secure additional increases would surely be politically unpopular Gov Guinns proposal regarding deferred energy rates may provide a mechanism to bring Sierra Pacifics rates more in line with its costs but most likely such a rate increase would take effect only once a year Meanwhile Sierra Pacific must still procure some power on the wholesale market where prices remain high a situation that could get ever worse this summer if warm temperature s drive up demand Thus ironically as much as state officials have tried t o avoid the energy crisis found in its western neighbor Nevada is increasing ly exhibiting some of the same fundamental problems found in California

ordering instructions IMAGE IssueAlert for April Aggregation Takes Off in Ohio by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis with additional contributions from Bob Bellemare Vice President Utility Services Green Mountain Energy Company featuring the leading brand of cleaner and renewable energy announced the completion of the countrys largestever energy aggregation contract encompassing more than Ohio electricity customers The groundbreaking sixyear agreement was struck with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council NOPEC a public electricity buying group which represents households across eight Ohio counties Under the ter ms of the contract Green Mountain Energy Company will begin serving residenti al customers across the NOPEC area with cleaner and renewable energy beginning Sept Analysis This announcement came out two weeks ago but it draws attention to a growing trend for energy aggregation in the state of Ohio Although full competition began in the state on Jan Ohio is maintaining a market development period that will last for the next three to five years During this period residential customers will continue to receive a percent reduction in the generation cost of their electric bill and hopefully take the time to make educated choices about where their power supply originates However what many Ohioans may not fully understand is that the many cities in the state actively engage in load aggregation a program that empowers t he cities to select power suppliers for their residents unless the residents clearly opt out of the aggregation According to the Consumers Counsel of the State of Ohio which recently issued an assessment report on deregulation in the state an estimated residential customers in FirstEnergy territories have switched to n ew suppliers About AEP Cinergy and Dayton Power Light residential customers have switched Note that these figures do not include many new aggregation contracts In addition electric suppliers have been certified with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio PUCO to provide electric generation services to Ohios residential consumers Of these jus t two currently have offers on the table and are soliciting new customers Consequently the report concluded that Ohio does not yet represent a stron g competitive market and that the true benefits from competition wont materialize in the state for three to five years after the market development period and rate reductions have expired However as municipal aggregation unfolds in Ohio new suppliers such as Green Mountain Energy are finding new competitive opportunities which could serve to jumpstart t he market in the state Although few Ohio residents are consciously making the choice to switch to a new power supplier they might find that their service has been switched ov er to a new provider just the same Ohios restructuring law permits aggregati on of electricity consumers by any entity that becomes certified with the PUCO Aggregation is the process by which consumers pool together their load and form an energy buying group In theory aggregation is supposed to reduce a power suppliers costs as the supplier is serving a group rather than havin g to acquire customers on an individual basis which is an extremely costly proposition These reduced costs typically are passed on to the consumers i n the aggregated group which makes buying power by bulk an attractive idea f or many energy customers Aggregation is not a new concept and has been used b y various buying groups across the country What makes aggregation noteworthy in Ohio is that an unusually large number of cities across the northern par t of the state have now become energy brokers for their residents intending to secure lower rates by engaging in aggregated sales contracts with power suppliers In addition Ohio is unique because many of its cities are automatically putting their residents into an aggregation program unless th e residents take the formal effort to step out of the program Residents within a city in Ohio must approve energy aggregation through a referendum In March the city of Parma Ohio became the first city t o vote in favor of an aggregation plan In fact residents of Parma overwhelming passed the measure giving the city government the authority t o serve as a power broker Since that time a large number of cities througho ut Ohio have followed suit According to a report in The Toledo Blade cities villages townships and counties across the state have voted on aggregation ordinances and according to the paper the ordinances have pass ed overwhelmingly in all areas The most current data available from PUCO indicates that cities have filed applications to become energy aggregators and that citiesincluding Cleveland and Toledohave b een formally certified to buy power on behalf of their residents Note that NOPEC which has secured the contract with Green Mountain Energy counts fo r one certification although the group represents more than municipalities These cities serving as the aggregating agents negotiate offers with powe r suppliers and purchase energy services on behalf of the buying group in Ohio this means any resident of a particular city that has been approved a s an aggregator The mostoften identified driver behind the move toward aggregation is the anticipated savings that a city believes it will be able to secure for its residents For instance the Toledo City Council reported ly sold its residents on the idea of aggregation by predicting that savings in the range of to percent could be achieved The incumbent utility servi ng the Toledo area is Toledo Edison a subsidiary of FirstEnergy which reportedly has the highest rates in the state Naturally Toledo residents embraced the aggregation plan with great enthusiasm The city of Toledo is still negotiating contracts with power suppliers but at this point has not received an acceptable bid Under Toledos aggregation plan the city has established that it will competitively bid and negotiate a contract with a competitive retail electric supplier to provide firm allrequirements service to the members of the aggregation program The contract will be for fixedpriced service to each class of customers at a rate that is lower tha n the standard offer from Toledo Edison Ohio law stipulates that a city can select either an optin or an optout approach to aggregation Under the optin approach energy customers must provide written notice to their city that they wish to be included in the aggregation program The optout approach requires that customers must formally notify their city that they do not wish to be included in the aggregation There are large promotional and administrative costs for the cities associated with the optin approach In addition many potential pow er suppliers made it clear that they would not bid on power contracts unless t he cities used an optout approach Consequently every city that has been certified in Ohio to become an energy aggregator is using the optout approach This in and of itself makes Ohio extremely unique Only one other state Massachusetts uses an optout approach to aggregation but it does not match the size and scope of the Ohio program The optout policy of the Ohio aggregation program has sparked a great deal of debate Proponents argue that residents will secure significant benefits from the aggregation process namely lower rates For instance in a powe r supply Memorandum of Understanding that the city of Alliance Ohio has established with Shell Energy savings in the range of to percent off o f the incumbents Ohio Edison residential rates are expected In addition proponents contend that municipalities electing to become an energy broker are providing an added service to their residents which is part of a large r trend of cities aggregating such services as water service garbage collection and sewage service Regarding the issue of the optout approach proponents of municipal aggregation say that residents are given multiple opportunities to notify the city that they do not want to participate in th e aggregation A resident has the option of continuing to receive service fro m the incumbent utility as long as they formally notify the city of this decision Opponents on the other hand argue that municipal aggregation amounts to nothing more than customer slamming since being assigned by the city to a new power supplier may be an involuntary act for those that did not consciously opt in for aggregation Also opponents take issue with aggregation because under the guise of customer choice customers still find themselves tied to the city aggregator unless they opt out which ma y preclude other power suppliers from entering that particular market In fac t as evidence of the policies related to the optout approach opponents migh t point to a stipulation under the City of Toledos Aggregation Plan in a filing with the PUCO Toledos policy asserts that a day optout period will be offered every two years during which customers can leave the City s aggregated pool without paying a switching fee The underlying result of this is that customers can only opt out of aggregation during a small windo w period every two years or incur undisclosed switching fees In addition opponents say that on average customers tend to switch power suppliers at the low rate of to percent even when they find themselv es paying higher bills or are offered a better supply contract Thus the vast majority of customers might end up remaining with a city aggregator simply due to inertia or a lack of understanding about their available options Those who question the value of municipal aggregation also suspect that cities might earn a financial gain from serving as an energy broker or atta ch extra hidden fees to customers to compensate for administrative costs or consultant fees There is also the possibility that the city will not be able to secure lowe r rates than those already in place with the incumbent utility Analysts have raised the question of what would happen if a city secures a contract with a power supplier and then for whatever reason the power supplier cannot fulfill its obligation to provide the power such as in a bankruptcy situation Would the incumbent utility be required to resume service for t he aggregated customers In other words who becomes the provider of last reso rt under a municipally aggregated model Based on the city of Alliance aggregation model if the power supplier defaults on its service the aggregated customers are entitled to return to the incumbent utility under a standard offer service While this offers a safety net for the customer it puts a potential burden on the incumbent utility with regard to its load planning and the difficulty in scheduling for a group of customers that may or may not return to its service Yet also from the incumbent utilitys perspective proponents of aggregati on say that utilities are often required to meet established targets related t o the percentage of their customer base that switches to a new energy provide r Such is the case with Ohio utilities such as FirstEnergy which will be penalized unless they meet their targets Consequently an incumbent utilit y often will have a divided reaction to aggregation On one hand the incumbe nt is potentially losing a core of its customer base but on the other hand it recognizes that aggregation may offer one mechanism for meeting its switchi ng targets Also unregulated affiliates of the incumbent utilities often end up being the ones bidding on the power supply contracts with the cities This is in fact the case with an unregulated affiliate of FirstEnergy which reportedly has made power supply bids with several Ohio cities that are aggregating In summary Ohio remains a test bed for the practice of municipal aggregation There is little doubt that at least in the northern half of t he state city governments are actively promoting themselves as energy brokers and remain confident that they can secure lower energy rates for their residents It will be interesting to see if Ohios aggregated cities can in fact achieve the goals they have established and how Ohio residents react when they begin receiving power from the citychosen supplier

electricity company UtiliCorp United Inc NYSE UCU said that the price range for an initial public offering IPO it is planning rose to a new range of to a share from to an increase of about percent Aquila reported the increase in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC It still plans to offer million common shares to the public of which are being sold by Aquila and the other by UtiliCorp In raising the high end of the price range Aquila could raise up to million compared to a previous million Analysis Aquilas IPO which is scheduled to take place later this month is part of a major restructuring effort that is unfolding at UtiliCorp In addition to a recently completed merger with St Joseph Light Power Company UtiliCorp has been planning the spinoff of the highly successful Aquila subsidiary for some time The IPO will make Aquila a standalone publicly traded company that can attract its own set of investors along with allowing parent company UtiliCorp to continue attracting its own funding Aquila is scheduled to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ILA the week of April Based in Kansas City Aquila is a provider of risk management services and a leading wholesaler of electricity and natural gas in North America It also provides wholesale energy services in the United Kingdom and has a presence in Scandinavia Germany and Spain Aquila has about million customers across the United States and in Canada Great Britain New Zealand and Australia The company has been on an aggressive expansion mode for most of the last year In October Aquila announced plans to acquire GPUs wholly owned subsidiary GPU International for million The purchase includes six independent USbased generating plants and a development generation project representing about MW of capacity With that purchase Aquila will own or control more than MW of generation Parent company UtiliCorp had billion in assets at the end of and sales of billion Aquila has maintained that it plans to use proceeds earned from the IPO to repay debt to UtiliCorp as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes Aquila has said that it will not be receiving any of the money from the shares sold by UtiliCorp If the IPO is completed UtiliCorp will own approximately percent of Aquila Incs outstanding capital stock Aquilas pending IPO got a jumpstart recently when UtiliCorp announced that its firstquarter earnings would be to percent higher than last years comparable results UtiliCorp attributed the estimated rise in profits to the continued strong performance of Aquila Specifically UtiliCorp is expected to make cents per share in the first quarter compared to cents in last years prior period according to two analysts polled by First CallThomson Financial The motives for spinning off Aquila are fairly clear UtiliCorp follows a growing list of other companies Southern Company and Xcel Energy for example that have spun off highrisk or highgrowth businesses into standalone entities Aquilas anticipated IPO price range of to compares strongly to Southern Energys now Mirants IPO price of and NRGs IPO price of Spinning off a highrisk independent power producing subsidiary is a wise move as the end result will be two public companies with dramatically different risk reward profiles Traditional utility investors have tended to be fairly risk averse preferring to invest in the regulated activities of a conservative utility company As Aquila continues to penetrate new competitive markets it will now have the freedom to transform itself into an appealing investment opportunity for investors who are more growth oriented and tolerant of risk Consequently the most practical way to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for UtiliCorp to bifurcate its operations offering two options for capital investment The second reason to spin off Aquila is that UtiliCorp has invested a great deal of capital in Aquila in order to grow that business and all the proceeds from the IPO are expected to be used by Aquila to repay amounts it owes to its parent company UtiliCorp stands as an example of what is perhaps the new model for energy companies On one hand UtiliCorp remains a conservative and methodical operation which very strategically is gaining scale throughout its service territory in the Midwest and beyond The company attempted two mergers last year one with Empire District Electric Company and the other with St Joseph Power Light Co The merger attempt with Empire failed due to regulatory obstacles but as noted UtiliCorp did complete the million merger with St Joseph about a month ago However the real emphasis coming from the company seems to be clearly placed on Aquila an aggressive and ambitious energy operation that I project will dramatically expand its trading and telecom bandwidth operations over the next year The IPO of Aquila should elevate its stature considerably as new funding opportunities should enable the company to expand its scope into new markets Aquila clearly acknowledges that it is attempting to take advantage of opportunities associated with ongoing electric deregulation in the United States and abroad As regulated utilities continue to unbundle their generation transmission and distribution services we expect to continue capitalizing on opportunities to create value Aquila said in its SEC filing This has always been a good complement to its parent company UtiliCorp which as noted remains rather conservative and steeped in the distribution side of the energy business The earnings profiles for both the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary are strong and since both companies should continue to attract separate sets of investors the timing appears to be right for a spinoff of Aquila In early February UtiliCorp announced record results for including a percent increase in earnings per share and a percent increase in sales Earnings available for common shares were million reflecting in large part the increased contributions from Aquila In fact Aquilas earnings before interest and taxes reached million a percent increase over Aquilas Wholesale Services earned million a percent increase over As of midmorning on April UtiliCorp shares were priced at about The company has a market capitalization of billion and a PE ratio of The average PE ratio for a standard utility operation is around Once the spinoff from its parent occurs Aquilas PE ratio will most likely be in the range of to on par with Mirant and NRG An archive list of previous IssueAlerts

Energy Markets Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn said the states investorowned utility companies could fail in a month without a deferred energy rate increase mechanism Guinn said Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power could be moving toward bankruptcy in days if the Legislature fails to quickly approve deferred energy rate increases Withou t approval the utilities will have difficulty borrowing money to buy power o n the wholesale market and to buy natural gas for use in their own power plants the governor said Analysis The prognosis appears to be getting increasingly worse for Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP and its two utility subsidiaries Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power At issue at the present time is the company s ability to secure significant rate increases that will cover its growing costs for securing power on the wholesale market which reportedly reached million for yearend The timeline for a rate increase approval and the specific amount of the rate increase should be the deciding factor s that determine whether or not Sierra Pacific Resources becomes the next maj or utility operation to file bankruptcy Along with this new warning from Gov Guinn Sierra Pacific Resources boar d of directors also just announced that it will not pay the dividend that is historically paid on May The board cited continued uncertainty over how Nevada will resolve its energy crisis The companys CEO Walt Higgins acknowledged that the dividend is vitally important in retaining investor confidence in Nevada but also said that it is equally important that the dividend reflect the companys current financial condition The company typically has paid a quarterly dividend of cents and the suspension of paying this quarters dividend will save the company less than million In addition Sierra Pacific Resources is engaged in costcutting measures that are focused on reducing all expenses other than those associated with safety and customer service The various news surrounding Sierra Pacific Resources played a direct role in the sharp decline in the companys stock on April Shares of the company dropped or percent to This is down from a week high of and book value of I have been tracking the growing financial problems of Sierra Pacific Resources for several weeks For background information please reference m y IssueAlerts from and As a brief summary Sierra Pacific Resources has found itself in a similar predicament to that experienced by the California utilities which has led Pacific Gas Electric Co to bankruptcy court Essentially Sierra Pacific Resources reported a fourthquarter loss of million or cents a share as a result of soaring costs of power in the western United States The company incurre d losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in the volatile wholesale market The situation has grown increasing ly worse for the company over the last month Without some rate relief the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling our ability to serve the needs of our customers said Mark Ruelle the companys chief financial officer The company attributed the financial losses to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Sierra Pacific Resources already received an emergency rate increase of percent million on March Clearly that increase has not been deeme d sufficient by the company or the governor to pay down the reported billion in debt that the company currently carries In an effort to save Sierra Pacific Resources from financial insolvency Gov Guinn has proposed the use of deferred energy rate cases which the states Senate Commerce an d Labor Committee passed on April the full Senate must still approve the measure The motion is being attached as an amendment to the previously approved Assembly Bill which prohibited the pending sale of Sierra Pacific Resources power plants and essentially returned Nevada to a regulated market The Nevada Assembly has yet to approve the measure which has prompted Gov Guinns warnings about a possible bankruptcy for Sierra Pacific Resources The State Assembly is scheduled to review the amendment this week Up to this point the operating utilities of Sierra Pacific Resources have been raising rates on a monthly basis to accommodate wholesale power purchases that they must make to supply power to customers Essentially a deferred rate increase would allow Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power to recover any fuel and power purchase costs that exceed current rates Under the amendment the utilities increased cost of purchasing wholesale power and natural gas would be factored into the onceayear rate increase calle d deferred because it takes effect after the power purchases have been made rather than immediately The rate increases could also be spread out over three years to minimize impact on customers In other words customers woul d not be exposed to the anticipated high cost for power that is expected to occur this summer in Nevada but instead would incur the increases a year from now or possibly spread over a threeyear program The benefit for the utilities is that their creditworthiness would be maintained which would allow them to continue to buy wholesale power and support various other projects Lenders allow the utilities to use accounts for unrecovered cost increases as a security for loans because they expect the utilities will be able to collect the money later through deferred ener gy rate cases Sierra Pacific Resources officially supports the move toward deferred energy rate increases as opposed to monthly increases for two reasons Sierra Pacific Resources believes further rate increases are desperately needed and a onceayear rate increase would be less detrimental to the companys customers It has been estimated that the increase could be as much as million next year based on Sierra Pacifi c Resources projections that its power purchase costs could increase by kWh or about percent If the deferred rate increase method is approved Sierra Pacific would no longer receive monthly rate increases Also the company would be required to forfeit any unrecovered power costs that have not been recouped through monthly rate increases that have taken place to date which reportedly would save customers about million Further Sierra Pacific Resources has agreed to credit customers for the first month of collections that occurred with regard to the percent million rate increase that took effect March This reportedly should save customers an additional million rounding off total savings to approximately million After providing the customer credit for the one month Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power would continue to collect the additional percent until next year when their rates are formally adjuste d Another provision of the pending amendment stipulates that Sierra Pacific Resources cannot participate in a deferred energy rate case if it completes the proposed sale of Portland General to Enron by July a deal that has been troubled due to Sierra Pacific Resources financial problems Along with the volatility of the western wholesale markets Sierra Pacific Resources has also been financially impacted by the recent restriction against the sale of its power plants Assembly Bill to which the amendment regarding the deferred rate increases is being added blocks the sale of Nevada power plants before July Nevada utilities will be allowed to apply to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada for plant sal es that include a state of substantial financial emergency after July Nevada regulators passed the measure out of concern about the states existing power supply and whether or not outofstate companies would sell power from the plants back into the state The measure has impacted Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power because they were counting on receiving approximately billion from pending sales of their power plants There is a rather striking parallel between what is happening in Nevada and what has been well documented as the California energy crisis Interestingl y the California utilities began to experience their financial difficulties after deregulation had already been in effect for about two years The Neva da utilities are experiencing financial problems which are also related to th e costs of procuring wholesale power in advance of the start of deregulation Wisely Nevada regulators have postponed the start of competition until market stability can be achieved within the state Key to achieving this stability will be the financial solvency of Sierra Pacific Resources two operating utilities Whether or not bankruptcy proceedings in Nevada can be averted remains to be seen but the sole determining factor appears to lie in what the State Assembly will soon decide with regard to deferred energy rat e increases An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Power Finance Risk Vertically integrated power company Dynegy is likely to sell its electricity distribution business within the next few years to focus on its more profitable energy generation and tradin g activities predict analysts familiar with the company Anatol Feygin seni or equity analyst at JP Morgan in New York says a sale of Dynegys transmission and distribution assets could fetch the company close to billion Analysis There are two different ways to evaluate the speculation that Dynegy may be looking to sell its transmission and distribution TD business From a companyspecific perspective such a strategy would make sense for Dynegy as it would allow the company to focus more exclusively o n its trading and marketing operation which has experienced truly spectacula r growth over the last year Although Dynegy has refused to deny or confirm reports that it is planning to sell its Tassets the companys financ ial numbers clearly build a case for such a move In addition Dynegys potenti al restructuring could very well be part of a larger trend in which those companies that place a high priority on their generation business see littl e value in remaining in the highly regulated and lowprofit Tmarket To be clear Dynegys Tsubsidiary is Illinois Power based in Decatur Ill which serves more than naturalgas and electric utility customers i n a squaremile area across Illinois Dynegy acquired Illinois Power when it completed its merger with Illinova in February At the time Dynegy maintained that a primary value of the acquisition was Illinois Powers Toperations and the fact that they would allow Dynegy to gain a foothold in the Illinois market Of course Dynegy also gained approximatel y MW of generation that Illinois Power had previously structured in an unregulated subsidiary Nevertheless if Dynegy is planning to sell its Toperation the sale would include Illinois Power and would represent a dramatic strategy turnaround for the company Lets look at the unique reasons why Dynegy might be considering such a mov e Its rather apropos that word begins to circulate of a sale of the company s Tbusiness at the same time that Dynegy releases its Q report i n which its earnings more than doubled As it has in the past few quarters Dynegy reported remarkable numbers including a percent increase in its earning s that resulted primarily from wholesale natural gas and electricity sales Dynegys recurring net income in the first quarter rose to million o r cents per diluted share from million or cents in Q Firstquarter revenues rose to billion from billion Dynegy reportedly produced and sold million megawatt hours of electricity in Q which represented a percent increase over the same period in Dynegy continues to discount the role that California sales played in its earnings despite the fact that it owns about MW of capacity in the state including joint ventures Due to its presence in the state Dynegy along with a handful of other power suppliers continues to be singled out as having gained a financial windfall from the California energy crisis Ye t even without California cold weather in the Midwest during Q also benefited Dynegy along with other natural gas and power producers such as Enron and Duke Looking nationally Dynegy has ownership stakes in about MW of generating capacity and is on its way toward the goal of ownin g or controlling MW by Consequently it seems fairly clear that wholesale marketing and trading is where Dynegy is making most of its money It only makes sense that the company would want to invest its existing capital resources and any funds gained from selling its Tassets into growing this part of its busine ss In contrast in general Toperations typically only bring a return of equ ity of about percent given the fact that they are still heavily regulated by FERC When percent of its earnings are coming from wholesale operations it is a nobrainer that Dynegy would move further and further into this market Moving forward Dynegys business most likely will become more abou t managing its power sales and exchanges on its stillnew trading platform Dynegydirect and less about operating a distribution system As noted I think Dynegys business model fits into what appears to be a growing trend among companies heavily focused on generation and trading First over the last year there has been a slew of companies that have divided or are planning to divide their regulated and nonregulated businesses AEP UtiliCorp Southern Company Reliant and NRG to name a few The operations are being split not only to attract two different sets of investors but also to allow a highgrowth business such as independent power production or wholesale trading to grow independently from regulated operations Second I think we can look to AEP as a company that is charting what may become a more common path Last fall after completing its acquisition of CSW AEP announced an extensive corporate restructuring that includes an exclusive focus on generation assets wholesale marketing and trading The company has no plans to expand its distribution assets either domestically or internationally AEP has not released its Q earnings report yet b ut for yearend wholesale margins at the company were cents per share higher than in AEP presently controls a generation portfolio of MW and is a top power marketer and top natural gas trader in North America Nevertheless AEPs restructuring could take more than a year to accomplish especially considering that the company may have pooling of interests restrictions related to its merger with CSW and other conditions that fall under PUHCA Thus its evident why the power marketing and generation business is so appealing In addition it is also becoming clear that transmission and distribution businesses might be something to avoid unless a company only wants to remain in this heavily regulated side of the energy industry Ive already mentioned the low average return on equity associated with Toperations also referred to as wires businesses in some sta tes In addition FERC continues to monitor interstate transmission activity and oftentimes the policies affixed onto separate transmission systems can be divergent and extremely complicated A company that owns or operates Tassets especially ones that transcend regional boundaries may find that the business causes an excessive amount of operational headaches that simpl y cannot be justified by its minimal profit opportunities Siting is also a problem as even when communities can be convinced of the need for new Tcapacity they typically do not want it within their own view As a result the wires business is presently considered to be rather lethargic considering its low risk low rate of return characteristics According to Reuters electricity demand over the next years is expected to increase by to percent In contrast transmission line capacity is expected to increase by only about percent The reasons for this disparit y are that many companies are avoiding further investment in transmission capacity due to the inherent disadvantages associated with this business Further companies that presently own or operate transmission lines are impacted by FERC Order which mandates a plan for forming or joining a regional transmission organization RTO by Dec of this year While RTO plans continue to remain a high priority the siting or expansion of Tcapacity has become a secondary concern Considering these many downsides to the wires business Dynegy and other companies that look to sell their Tbusinesses may not have such an ea sy time with the divestiture As noted the business is heavily regulated and any potential sale would have to be approved by several layers of regulatory agencies In addition a company looking to purchase Tassets assumin g that the company is aware of all the risks involved would most likely be a company that is only interested in Tand is not an active participant in the generation business There are companies with this kind of business model National Grid comes t o mind as a leading example The UK company is one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies and for over a year has been attempting to establish a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the industry primarily in the United States National Grid has acquired Niagara Mohawk New England Electric System NEES and Eastern Utilities Associates EAU all Toperations located in the Northeastern United States Dynegys assets are located in the Midwest and do not seem consistent with National Grids regional focus However the point to be made is that there are companies active in the United States that are aggressively pursuing Toperations despite the seemingly obvious risks associated with this business An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

a sign of personal virtue does not make for sound or comprehensive policy Rather he supports a supplyside approach of constructing new fossil and nuclearfueled generation plants The main concerns with nuclear generation are of course safety and the handling of nuclear waste Supporters of nuclear energy however believe these risks are worth managing especially when compared to the longterm health risks and potential global climate impact of fossilfueled generation New nuclear generation designs are being developed that are expected to be inherently safer than predecessor designs There is an article running in todays Wall Street Journal exploring safer reactor designs for the nuclear power generation industry The article tells the story of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT professor Andrew Kadak challenging his students at MIT to design a nuclear reactor which doesnt produce carbon dioxide He told them it should be cheaper to build and simpler to operate than any constructed to date with no possibility of a meltdown The students must have done their research quite well as they returned with what is known as a pebblebed reactor A pebblebednuclear reactor is currently under development by a South African consortium being headed by South African utility Eskom and its South African partner the Industrial Development Corporation IDC To date Eskom and IDC have attracted two international investors in their Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR project One is British Nuclear Fuel BNFL and the other is better known to the United States as PECO or Exelon The PBMR works by using uranium elements pebbles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere about the size of a tennis ball In addition helium is used as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closedcyclegas turbine and generator So why is it safer than previous nuclear reactor designs According to PBMR the safety features are described as follows Representative of a new generation of advanced reactors the PBMR is characterized by a series of inherent safety properties differentiating it from other reactor types It is due to these characteristics that the PBMR do not require the typical nuclear safety systems to actively guard the plant for the duration of its operational life The use of graphite as fuel element claddingmoderator and core structural materialreflector means that a core melt situation can be ruled out because of the large difference existing between the normal average operating temperature degC and the maximum tolerable temperature degC To summarize the PBMR is a safer design because it utilizes fuel pebbles encased in graphite and makes use of helium as a coolant Supposedly this reduces the threat of a core meltdown to a theoretical zero Also distributed generation enthusiasts should warm to the fact that this design would be sized to produce about MW which is about percent of the output of a conventional nuclear or fossil fueldriven power station The modular approach makes it possible to build smaller nuclear power plants to serve local needs and to expand them as demand grows Nuclear waste has been an issue for some time now in the United States Yucca Mountain located in Nevada is being tested as a suitable site for a spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste repository Experts throughout the world agree that the most feasible and safe method for disposing of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground Based on this consensus the United States Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of that directs the Department of Energy DOE to find a site and characterize it If the site is found suitable and a license application is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC the DOE is to build and operate an underground disposal facility Yucca Mountain is the current site under investigation by the DOE How much waste are we talking about here The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States However if we take the range of estimates it would equate to a football field ranging from fifteen to twenty feet deep That estimate takes into account all high level nuclear waste generated in the United States since the start of a nuclear program in the s Compared to other hazardous materials the amount of nuclear waste generated per year is very small All of the nuclear plants in the US produce about tons of spent fuel a year whereas million tons of chemical waste are generated in the US per year According to an information source managed by the University of MissouriRolla American Nuclear Society Nuclear wastes are for the same power output some million times smaller in volume than the wastes from coal plants Highlevel nuclear wastes can be disposed of by diluting them with twice their own volume of neutral materials as they are changed into glass or ceramic form The reprocessed waste volume from a megawatt nuclear power plant would fit easily under a typical dining room table A coal plant of the same capacity megawatts produces some tons of waste per minute And not to bash coal Vice President Dick Cheney also informed the Toronto audience that the Bush Administration has budgeted an additional million for next year up from million this year to support development of cleaner coal technologies The United States has a tremendous coal reserve that clearly the current administration believes must be utilized to meet our growing energy demand So where does this lead us It appears that as the years go by technology is improving the environmental effects of our generation sources Natural gas is becoming more efficient coal is getting cleaner and nuclear is getting safer The Bush administration appears to be realizing that fuel diversity is a good thing for an energy policy An overreliance on any one type of fuel for power generation can cause problems in a crisis situation Is nuclear making a comeback in the US The signposts seem to be inferring that it is Just last week a California grassroots watchdog group proposed plugging nuclearpowered US Navy aircraft carriers into Californias power grid The power from two of three aircraft carriers now on the West Coast could provide enough energy to power a minimum of homes in the state Also the first demonstration PBMR unit is scheduled for commercial operation by Should the test prove successful and the NRC approve the design we could be seeing new nuclear reactors in the United States by An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

Source According to a new report from Energy Info Source the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has begun to articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs With several approvals a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO application FERC is shaping RTO participation among investorowned utilities Analysis The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO applications based on decisions that the commission has made up to this point According to Energy Info Source FERC has concentrated its efforts on the Southeast and Western regions Within the Southeast FERC has essentially rejected Southern Companys SeTrans Gridco while conditionally approving GridSouth and Grid Florida In the West the RTO West applicationwhich represents an alliance among nine utilitiesappears to have received FERCs favor and is the preeminent leader among nonISO RTO participation efforts However despite these established trends FERC still remains at odds with many of the leading transmission owners in the nation which foresee a potential conflict between the commissions rulemaking on transmission rates and its potential impact on retail rates which are regulated by individual states For background an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission systems within a particular region The origins of FERCs RTO policy dates back to its December Order in which it strongly encouraged all transmissionowning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO by Oct with actual membership established by December of this year FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received and its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members of the commission hold Over the last year or two FERC has engaged in an ongoing debate between its preference for transco forprofit models for RTOs as opposed to independent system operators nonprofit Chairman Curt Heacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model while other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs However moving forward it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate including the limit of one entity per region As noted FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the Southeast and Western regions In addition to the obvious need to establish stability in the West another explanation for the commissions dual focus is that other regions in the United States namely the Midwest and the Northeast already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO FERC may be focusing on the West and Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established an acceptable level of market independence The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending before FERC The RTO West which FERC has referred to as the anchor of the region has been generally accepted as a broad concept RTO West includes nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest Avista Bonneville Power Administration BPA Idaho Power Montana Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power BPA is by far the largest of the RTO West members controlling about percent of the transmission system in the region For the most part RTO West is an ISO although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella The second western RTO is Desert Star which includes utilities that are located in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas The third proposed RTO for the Western region is the California ISO which has been operational since April and wishes to remain a standalone entity FERCs main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its desire for one RTO in the area instead of three The primary rationale for this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be more easily managed than multiple entities In addition gaming by power generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs which would require additional market rules to control the gaming FERCs general approach has been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed The California ISO has tweaked the commissions patience in particular as this solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join other entities The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps in California whenever reserves fall below percent This has been something that the state has long requested but the price caps come with the condition that California must file an application by June to enter into an RTO with other Western states Otherwise the price caps will be lifted California is currently contesting this condition Under the leadership of Chairman Heacutebert it is clearly FERCs goal to establish only one RTO for the entire Western region which puts the federal agency at odds with the California government once again The Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares Heacuteberts belief that one regional RTO is the best strategy for the West but also has said that proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the new organization up and running Other western governors have stood in unity that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being Across the country there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the Southeast For instance Chairman Heacuteberts preference for minimal RTOs within one region appears to be a national viewpoint Yet there are unique questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in the West The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida RTOwhich includes Florida Power Light Florida Power Corp and Tampa Electricand GridSouth RTO which includes Progress Energy Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas However FERC rejected Southern Companys SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies other than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy The commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo but told Southern Company not to reapply and to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO In addition FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over control of their generation assets The rejection and conditional approval from FERC which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth have been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in the region should join the alreadyapproved entities In fact FERC reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority Santee Cooper and SeTrans GridCo so that they might also join Some reports indicate that because the Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model such as the one in California FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with its own longterm goals which include a single RTO for the area Nevertheless despite receiving approval from FERC GridSouth is taking issue with two aspects of the commissions approval First GridSouth questions FERCs jurisdiction over bundled retail service and specifically wants the commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled transmission rates GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates including the charge for transmission service under FERC jurisdiction which would allow the commission to change the rates in the future FERCs Order which essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States clearly states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would agree to GridSouths interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled transmission rates Despite these isolated disputes the formation of RTOs across the United States appears to be coming together While the industry awaits for further FERC action on pending RTO applications it is clear that certain trends are emerging FERCs longstanding preference for the transco model over the ISO model appears to be diminishing as evidenced by the commissions approval of RTO West and apparent support of nonprofit operations such as the New York ISO and the Midwest ISO Rather FERC has demonstrated a more primary preference for solitary RTO entities within a region regardless of whether the entity operates as a transco or an ISO From a philosophical perspective establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple entities Further a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain intertie problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region However it will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in independent RTOs such as California to relinquish their autonomy and join forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding the operation of a transmission system An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

approached Calif Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal now made public that offered monetary concessions if the state drops lawsuits and investigations into the companys alleged price gouging Duke made the offer in a secret page letter sent in April to Gov Davis office which the governor confirmed on May Davis spokesman called the letter Dukes wish list which included having the state call off investigations of the North Carolinabased generator Although Gov Davis has acknowledged receipt of the proposal he has not officially accepted or rejected the offer Analysis Dukes desire to make a settlement with the state of California stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March At that time FERC put California power sellers including Duke on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification for their prices Duke is considered to be one of four companies along with Dynegy Reliant and Williams that faces the biggest potential refunds to the state of California In fact Duke reportedly faces potential refunds of up to million for the power that it has sold to California since the start of this year We can fast forward from FERCs investigation to Dukes good faith settlement offer that now sits before Gov Gray Davis The plan sets out specific action steps for new generation conservation programs electric and gas infrastructure improvements regional transmission frameworks and environmental goals In addition Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement agreement for which the California government would agree to cease all ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company Dukes appropriate payment is based on fair estimate of the companys alleged overcharges for power that it sold to the state Yet beyond the spin control surrounding this offer Dukes proposal amounts to a mutual backscratching agreement with Duke clearly obtaining the largest benefit Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke made by the governor and others In return Duke will refund to the state some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping the state with its power supply needs However under the offer Duke will admit no wrongdoing Rather the companys proposal is being presented as an altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of Californias flawed market Neither Duke nor Gov Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Dukes settlement offer but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction of the million that the state wants Other specifics within Dukes proposal that are important to note include the companys commitment to work with the state to get MW of additional peaking capacity ready for summer In addition Duke has offered to enter into longterm contracts with the state on reasonable terms and also attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Dukes pledge to share the financial pain of Californias troubled market with other market participants Presently Duke supplies about percent of Californias power needs the majority of which is based on longterm contracts This is a significant point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market in contrast to many of the other power suppliers under FERCs investigation The company also owns the Moss Landing plant located south of San Jose Calif which it is upgrading with a million investment Duke has established that the plant should be able to provide approximately percent of Californias new generation in While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits the companys total wholesale profits soared percent to million for yearend For the year Dukes California power plants generated percent more electricity than they did in In addition in the plants provided million megawatt hours of electricity to the states power grid versus million the previous year Further in January and February Duke charged more for power through credit premiums which were levied because of the risk of nonpayment associated with Californias financially struggling utilities Duke claims that it is still owed about million by the Department of Water Resources Californias power purchaser Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California On May Tulsabased Williams Co also one of the top four companies reportedly owing the most to California announced that it has agreed to pay million to the California ISO to end FERCs investigation into whether the companys plants were kept offline to drive up prices For several months FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the companys alleged shutdown of two power generation units owned by AES which reportedly allowed Williams to sell power from other units at higher prices The stipulation and consent agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties In other words Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing or price manipulation A Williams spokesperson has said that the million will be deducted from the million that Williams is still owed for power sales to the California ISO and the California PX Much like Duke Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year For yearend the company reported unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for In addition the company reported Q unaudited results that were more than double that of Q million or cents per share compared with a restated million or cents per share Moreover the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made from power sales to the state However one benefit of the deals is that they would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation Yet at least as of this writing Gov Davis remains less than enthused about Dukes offer and has not eased off from his accusation that Duke along with the other power generators has bilked millions of dollars from California consumers In fact although the governor has said that he is willing to continue negotiations with the various power generators he has also vowed not to call off the dogs in the state and federal investigation of any price gouging Toward that end the states lieutenant governor has initiated a classaction suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other power generators accused of price fixing This legal claim follows similar suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego All of the suits basically claim the same thing that Duke and four other power generators engaged in unlawful trading practicessuch as shutting down plantsto drive up market prices in California Duke of course maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied Nevertheless Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the companys part could eventually be determined The stakes have also been raised with some California attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price gouging should face civil and criminal penalties which could include incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the price manipulation to take place Consequently despite Dukes offer and any other proposals that subsequently come from power generators it appears that litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

IMAGE IMAGE May Williams in Agreement to Acquire Barrett Resources By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIMAGE Barrett Resources Corporation NYSE BRR announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with The Williams Companies Inc NYSE WMB for Williams to acquire all outstanding shares of Barrett in a transaction valued at approximately billion including the assumption of about million in debt The terms of the merger agreement which was approved by both companies boards of directors provides for Williams to promptly commence a firststep cash tender offer of per share for percent of the outstanding Barrett common stock followed by a secondstep merger with a fixed ratio of shares of Williams common stock for each remaining share of Barrett common stock Based on Williams closing price on May the stock portion of the transaction is valued at per share On this basis the transaction has a blended value of per share Analysis This is a major coup for Williams as it transforms the company into a naturalgas transporter and producer which should offer tremendous support to its already hugely successful power trading operation As the United States continues to face a naturalgas shortage Williams is wisely acquiring assets that will guarantee it a steady flow of naturalgas supply which the company estimates will contribute to nearly percent of its supply obligations Much like its competitor Calpine Corp which recently acquired naturalgas company Encal Energy Williams is shrewdly reshaping its business model to gain lucrative control over power supply in addition to its prominent positions as a power marketer and trader As has been widely publicized Williams has secured the acquisition of Barrett away from competing bidder Shell Oil Co a unit of AngloDutch powerhouse Royal Dutch Shell Group and the worlds secondlargest oil company behind Exxon Mobil Shell had been aggressively pursuing Barrett in a hostile takeover for months and had increased its bidding offer to a share as late as last week Barrett a relatively small naturalgas operation but one that owns valuable reserves in the Rocky Mountains resisted Shells advances for reasons that are not completely known and put itself back on the market last week Williams entered the picture and trumped Shells proposal with an offer to pay per share Some financial analysts have already claimed that Williams is overpaying for Barrett as the per share purchase price represents about a percent premium over the ashare price of Barretts stock before Shell made its original offer in March Shell appears to agree that the price Williams is paying is too high Once Williams made its offer Shell quickly bowed out of the bidding war stating that although it still wanted to partner with Barrett it was unwilling to pay an excessive price for the company So what makes Barrett so appealing to Williams Barrett an independent naturalgas and crude oil exploration and production company is in the business to locate and produce naturalgas supplies As naturalgas supplies have tightened Barretts profile in the industry has ascended which peaked Shells original interest Up to this point Williams has primarily operated as a trader and distributor and therefore has been subject to the volatility of the wholesale market and the scarcity of naturalgas supplies By controlling the commodity itself Williams will not only have a guaranteed flow of supply to fulfill its contracts but also will have more flexibility to sell its power in markets where it can charge the best price Most of Barretts exploration efforts are concentrated around the Rocky Mountains Colorado Wyoming and southeastern Kansas which offers good proximity to the powerstarved and highgrowth Western states Further Barrett represents a strong company with a market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of compared to Williams market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of The benefit to Williams is clear At the very least the acquisition of Barrett more than doubles Williams naturalgas reserves Presently Williams controls about trillion cubic feet of natural gas mostly in Colorado New Mexico and Wyoming and has established a strong presence on the delivery side of the naturalgas business Williams produces about MW of electricity per year but has established a goal of producing about MW within the next few years Already this business model has paid off nicely for Williams which reported million in marketing and trading revenue for yearend more than doubling revenue from For Q Williams overall profit increased to million up from million in Q The acquisition of Barrett provides Williams with about trillion cubic feet of gas reserves which can be added to Williams transportation and trading operation In other words Williams will gain a secure stream of a commodity that is currently in short supply and prone to redhot prices In terms of reserves Williams reportedly will become the tenth largest naturalgas company in the United States Further as naturalgas supplies in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico traditionally good source locations appear to be diminishing Williams gains assets in the Rocky Mountain region where naturalgas exploration is flourishing As noted Calpine Corp NYSE CPNwhich has a rather parallel business model to Williams at least on the trading sidealso is leading the trend toward naturalgas consolidation Just last week Calpine announced a partnership with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners NYSE KMI to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline a mile highpressure interstate naturalgas pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in California This announcement followed Calpines acquisition earlier this year of Torontos Encal Energy whose assets currently produce approximately million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day and can access about one trillion cubic feet of proven and probable gas resources Williams has a similar project in Florida where it has partnered with Duke Energy to jointly purchase the Coastal Corporations percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project The Gulfstream project is a proposed mile steel pipeline designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida As a side note Shells loss of Barrett must be particularly painful for the international oil titan as it is the second failed acquisition that the company has experienced within the past few weeks Shell also lost a bid for Australias Woodside Petroleum for which it offered billion when the Australian government blocked the deal due to national interest concerns Shell certainly had the economic resources to make a higher bid for Barrett but the company has steadfastly maintained its principle of not making what it deems as overpayments for prospective companies In addition Williams strong stock and strong profits value also supported the purchase of Barrett despite the fact that by comparison Williams is a much smaller company than Shell Oil For its part Shell says that it will continue to seek other acquisitions that strengthen and diversify its assets portfolio outside its existing core areas Williams stock fell about more than percent upon word of the acquisition which is not surprising since it is attempting to purchase a larger company at a very high premium Barrett shares jumped about to As of midmorning trading on May Williams shares were priced at while Barrett shares were priced at In order to close the acquisition Williams needs to receive approval from antitrust regulators and shareholders However both companies remain confident that they can close the acquisition in to days To protect its stock which apparently played a factor in its ability to support the acquisition of Barrett Williams reportedly is including a breakup fee in the purchase contract which would be applied in the event that Williams eventually loses Barrett to another company

billing strategies and billing software meter reading the application service provider ASP model and a technology forecast for the industry Each day at the conference I will select the most important issue of the day and provide you with the independent analysis that youve come to expect from IssueAlert So even if you cant attend the conference you can still participate in the dialogue and information exchange Will McNamara Peace Software announced that it will join with IBM Global Services to deliver largescale and advanced technology solutions to utility and retail energy companies operating in regulated and deregulated markets Using stateoftheart and proven approaches IBM Global Services and Peace Software will plan develop test and deliver customerspecific implementations of Peaces Energy suite Services will span the life cycle of an installation from rapid deployment through production site enhancement and maintenance Peace and IBM have secured a contract to provide full customer management services for Xcel Energy which expands upon a strategic alliance that has already existed between the utility and IBM Analysis Both Peace Software and IBM have been aggressively pursuing the same customer management space for some time The fact that the two companies have now come together to combine their unique skill sets establishes a strong competitive force in this fastgrowing arena which can include outsourced billing meter reading data collection customer care CRM and CIS systems IBM Global Services as an information technology services provider brings an operational and management capability for backoffice requirements In turn Peace Software provides a unique suite of billing and customer data software that many utilities are purchasing as they move from legacy systems to more flexible solutions As noted Peace Software and IBM Global Services immediately followed the announcement of their partnership with a new multimillion fiveyear contract with Minneapolis Minnbased Xcel Energy Under the contract the two companies will implement Peaces Energy suite to support Xcels million regulated and deregulated electricity and gas customers located in Western and Midwestern states In addition the Peace suite will be used to support Xcel Energys participation in Texas deregulation pilot program which begins in June The project will replace Xcel Energys mainframe and client server legacy system The implementation plan for Xcel Energy includes all customer management commodity billing and Internet components that are offered in the Peace Energy software The contract with Xcel expands upon an alreadyestablished alliance between IBM and the utility that dates back to IBM originally contracted with Public Service Co of Colorado an early predecessor to Xcel Energy Under the million year alliance IBM has provided datacenter operations and disaster recovery for Xcel Energy including networking help desk PC and LAN support distributed services support and application development and maintenance services Through the agreement Xcel Energy awarded IBM preferred provider status making IBM the vendor of choice for any IT products and services that the utility may need In this next phase of the partnership with Xcel IBM appears to be moving the focus on a mainframe and clientserver system to a packaged product for Peace Software This is a major step for Xcel as many utilities still retain internal control over their own applications and are reticent to outsource these functions to an outside company In addition this is a huge deal for Peace and IBM as they may be planning to eventually extend the platform beyond the partnership with Xcel In fact Xcel Energy is just the latest in a growing list of competitive utilities and energy companies that have outsourced or replaced their billing customer care needs In competitive markets a prerequisite for the continued growth of an energy company or utility is a comprehensive billing software system that can handle the complexities of an unbundled environment which is where the value of Peace Software comes in Most competitive retail providers realize that they must be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Further as competitive energy providers operate in different states it is important that they eliminate the different automated and manual processes that are common in legacy systems This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate backoffice functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software An energy company basically has two options with regard to billing customer care solutions The first option is for the energy company to purchase the billing software directly from a software provider such as Peace and manage its own billing needs The second option is to completely outsource the entire billing customer care services to a company such as IBM Global Services By joining forces Peace Software and IBM are anticipating that energy companies will be inclined to not only select the Peace software but also opt to use IBM Global Services implementation and management services Peaces Energy software which reportedly is being rapidly deployed in transitioning energy markets around the world is designed to provide several selfserve features including customer enrollment summary billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy suite was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in an integrated tool Peaces Energy Version software which was released in December is billed as the first ebusiness solution to integrate customer and commodity management The upgraded features of Energy Version include BC ecommerce functions an advanced thirdgeneration browser user interface BUI enhanced billing capabilities and expanded industrystandard support for the Oracle i database system The result of these technical improvements according to Peace is a capability to exploit the latest Web browser technologies to support and streamline large scale missioncritical customer service operations Further the Energy software is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another The Energy software can accommodate billing services around natural gas electricity water home security and home mortgaging The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing On its own Peace Software has become a dominant player in the energy billing software market offering its onestopshop billing tool to a variety of utilities and energy companies Peace boasts customers such as AEP MidAmerican Energy Enron BC Gas Dominion Retail Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services Peace has also entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy suite at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver The company is based in Miami and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utility market The company has used strategic partnerships as one method of growing its business Prior to this partnership with IBM Global Services Peace Software announced in early April an alliance with Exolink a provider of retail energy business process integration services Under this partnership Peace and Exolink are marketing a platform for energy retailers in both regulated and unregulated markets in which customer data can be shared in and out of multiple markets Peace also just signed a contract with Delinea a vertical services provider in which Delinea has licensed Peaces Energy software as a customer management application targeted at midsized utilities However the billing customer care market is arguably one of the most competitive businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation Consequently the list of competitors that Peace Software and IBM Global Services face grows literally every month I cannot list all of the competitors here but a few are worth mentioning as they have grown at a similar pace to Peace and IBM Such competitors include Alliance Data Systems ADS ConneXt Enlogix Excelergy Itrons MVPBS LODESTAR Orcom Solutions SCT Banner SPL Worldgroup and US Power Solutions Some of these companies offer just the software solution which is licensed to utilities or energy companies while others serve as the outsourced management company that implements the software package The partnership between Peace Software and IBM Global Services runs parallel to similar partnerships between ADS Excelergy and Enlogix SCT software Currently SCIENTECH is witnessing a trend away from large licenseonly agreements and into Strategic Sourcing agreements In the customer care field today Enlogix is the largest application service provider with over million end customers in production today Orcom is the second largest with over million live customers Realistically it will be about two years before Peace and IBM are able to fully migrate all of Xcels million customers to the Peace software However if this transition materializes it could represent the largest outsourced customer care contract to date An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

Industry Analysis IMAGEWith California struggling through yet another round of rolling blackouts this week and reportedly its thirtyninth issuance of a Stage emergency warning since January the Bush administration is putting the finishing touches on its muchawaited energy strategy A national energy plan which is the culmination of nearly three months of meetings by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to be announced by President Bush sometime next week Even before being released the plan is surrounded by controversy and criticism that the Bush administration remains too focused on longterm solutions and has not provided any immediate fixes to national energy problems that are most extremely illustrated by the power crisis in California Analysis As noted the Bush administration wont officially release its energy plan until next week However based on recent statements made by both the president and the vice president we already have a good indication of the broad strokes of the plan Since January it has been expected that President Bush will unveil an energy plan that strongly encourages exploration for domestic oil and natural gas The administrations position on conservation efforts and renewable energy as longterm solutions to the nations power needs is less clear as both Bush and Vice President Cheney have made rather inconsistent statements regarding these issues conservation in particular Yet perhaps the most controversial elements of the plan are the administrations expected positions on nuclear energy and the right of the federal government to usurp state authority and mandate the placement of new electric transmission power lines As noted for several months it has been anticipated that President Bush will allot more funding for exploration efforts than renewable energy or conservation efforts see my IssueAlert from for more information on this Despite the fact that this position has been intensely criticized it is important to note that the president has not indicated that these approaches will not have a role in his administrations strategy In fact recent word from the administration is that at least conservation will receive a major emphasis in the plan However at the same time the president has stated publicly that the nation cant conserve its way to energy independence Vice President Cheney echoed this sentiment by remarking that conservation is not a sufficient basis for a sound comprehensive energy policy In addition realistically renewable energy sources only account for about percent of the total energy supply Cheney claims that even if renewable sources were tripled over the next years they would only account for percent of the nations total energy mix Consequently although conservation and renewables will be included in the imminent energy plan the Bush administration is clearly focused on other solutions that it believes are more realistic We will have to wait until the plan is released to adequately assess the extent to which conservation and renewable energy will be supported by the Bush administration Perhaps more interesting at this time are two controversial components of the forthcoming energy plan that have emerged this week First a key element of the Bush administrations plan will be the expansion of energy infrastructures to deliver power across the nation Specifically it is becoming increasingly clear that the energy task force led by Vice President Cheney will recommend that Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham draw up legislation that allows for FERC to assume control over private property to accelerate the construction of transmission power lines The task force believes that the lack of transmission capacity is one of the key causal factors of the California energy shortage and concerns about power supply in other areas of the country In other words in addition to Californias instate power supply deficiency power from outside the state cannot be easily imported due to clogged infrastructure A deficient transmission system is also a major factor in potential power problems facing New York City this summer FERC already has what is known as eminent domain authority over the siting of naturalgas pipelines which typically are underground and therefore do not spark much public resistance The construction of new power lines however is a contentious issue New lines are often blocked due to the not in my backyard NIMBY syndrome In addition state governments presently regulate the construction of new transmission lines and have been reticent to relinquish this control to the federal government In addition many states view the eminent domain policy as an invasion of home rules and a violation of homeowners rights If as expected the Bush energy plan extends eminent domain to FERC for electric transmission lines then the commission would be given the authority to force private landowners to allow new power lines to be built on their land The government typically compensates property owners for the seizure of their land but this has not appeased state governments in their opposition to the rule Once the land is taken from private owners utilities and not the government would be given ownership of the land and allowed to build the new lines This is something that utilities as a group have requested for some time as presently they face multiple local and state regulatory obstacles whenever they seek to build new lines In interviews this week Cheney admitted that eminent domain would be addressed in the energy task plan but has not specified what the plan would propose However the vice president did acknowledge that the key issue to be addressed is whether or not the federal government should have the same authority on electrical lines as it already has on gas lines In the second controversial element of the forthcoming energy plan Cheney also revealed in recent interviews that nuclear power will factor in rather significantly to the task forces proposals On May in an exclusive interview with CNN Cheney said that the answers to the nations energy woes lie in increasing the supply of energy sources including giving nuclear power a fresh look Given the high prices of natural gas Cheney has argued that from an economic standpoint now is a good time for nuclear power to reemerge In addition in the CNN interview the vice president pointed to the fact that nuclear power is recognized as a safe technology that doesnt emit any carbon dioxide at all The only significant problem that Cheney sees with nuclear power is the nuclear waste piling up at reactors all over the country Consequently although the vice president supports an increase in the nations reliance on nuclear power he also supports the use of a national permanent repository that can be developed for nuclear waste Yucca Mountain located in Nevada is being tested as a suitable site for a spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste repository Experts throughout the world agree that the most feasible and safe method for disposing of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground Moreover when the Bush administrations energy plan is officially released next week it will be interesting to see the specific proposals that the Cheney task force offers In the meantime the plan is already generating a great deal of controversy as some Republicans worry about political fallout from the administrations previous reluctance to intervene and repair problems in California Constituents across the country increasingly are voicing concerns about pervasive power problems although California and New York appear to be the only two areas with real worries Given the growing sense of anxiety about the energy problems and its impact on the nations economy it is feared that the lack of any clear shortterm solutions will soon spark an intense round of fingerpointing that could impact future elections Rising gasoline prices and predictions for summer blackouts beyond California are only raising the heat on this redhot debate Cheney himself admits that the energy plan has become a political debate in addition to being a discussion about policy For months it was clear that the Bush administration and FERC preferred to let California solve its own problems But after months of rolling blackouts the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and projections for severe summer problems Californias problem has now become President Bushs problem The bottom line is that an enormous amount of political credibility is riding on the forthcoming energy plan in addition to the fact that the nation will be eagerly looking for the Bush administration to offer reliable solutions to the increasing power problems An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American

Albuquerque Complex IT Issues to Be Addressed By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEThe th annual CIS Conference began today in Albuquerque NM For the next three days I will be attending sessions and workshops at the conference interviewing key leaders of billing software and customer care management companies and gathering information about the new trends in technology and IT systems that changes in the energy industry are demanding Through the conference I will write each mornings IssueAlert from the conference floor so that if you are not physically at the conference you can still participate through virtual attendance I am particularly looking forward to the keynote presentation scheduled to be delivered on May by former President George Bush Coincidentally the former president will speak on the same day that his son current President George W Bush unveils his longawaited energy plan This should make for some interesting dialogue which I will be sure to pass along Some of you who are not directly involved in CIS customer information systems may question the importance of this rapidly changing part of the energy industry So let me provide a brief overview of how CIS serves as the foundation for much of nextgeneration business transactions in the evolving energy industry which also will indicate the kinds of issues that will be addressed at this weeks conference Although customer care meter reading and billing have always been fundamental parts of a utilitys operation deregulation has drastically changed the rules of the game First we have witnessed an influx of new energy providers which has raised the competitive bar considerably and companies that seek to manage what was once under the exclusive domain of the regulated utility meter reading billing systems remittance processing etc In addition the business model of the traditional utility has changed dramatically over the last years or so Many utilities have become more horizontally integrated meaning that they have established multiple entities to handle the unbundled services that they provide in new markets Not surprisingly the information systems that were employed under a regulated model are now rather insufficient to accommodate the needs of a deregulated market Yet at the same time utilities often do not know how to replace their existing data systems or have the time to do so Nevertheless an essential element to the utilitys or energy companys growth is a comprehensive billing software and customer management system Customers often demand online energy usage and billing data that is available on a basis In addition deregulation has allowed utilities and energy companies that previously operated in a narrow service territory to expand into new regions As these utilities and companies enter different markets they seek to eliminate various automated and manual processes required by vertically integrated systems that were required by legacy systems This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software that is available from many competing companies Much of the software that is now available is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The challenges that exist within the CIS space are many An energy company basically has two options with regard to billing customer care customer relationship management CRM The first option is for the energy company to purchase the billing software directly from a software provider and manage its own billing needs The second option is to completely outsource the entire billing customer care services to a company that will manage the entire service I have seen some reports indicating that up to percent of deployments of systems for customer relationship management fail Thus any decision that an energy company makes with regard to its CIS network constitutes a critical and expensive strategic step In addition the capability of an outsourced billing provider to handle the complex billing needs of a utility is still a concern Enlogix is the largest application service provider with over million end customers in production today Orcom is the second largest with over million live customers Peace Software and IBM Global Solutions just announced a deal to provide full customer management services for Xcel Energys million customers which represents the largest contract of its kind to date As the market for outsourced customer management in the utility industry is still rather nascent there are lingering concerns about how effectively utility customers will be migrated to a new software system Further the variances between commercial and industrial CI and residential billing are also a concern Therefore these two classes of customers typically are billed by different systems There are other challenges that the CIS industry faces including California and other states are causing legislative and regulatory bodies to reconsider deregulation which is providing uncertainty around the requirements and timing for such systems Multijurisdictional utilities are being faced with decisions on how to provide customer care that is regulated and raterecoverable in one state while being competitive and not recoverable in another state Public utility commissions are imposing codeofconduct rules that disallow the sharing of information across the various parts of the utility business in this case wires and retail This causes further complexity on how to bill these various customers The new deregulated world requires new functionality such as load profiling at the residential level load forecasting wholesaletoretail contracting and settlements that did not exist in the regulated world The CIS conference will offer the venue for stakeholders in this market to exchange information and engage in a dialogue on these and other challenges Various workshops will take place focusing on call center operations outsourcing versus Webbased CIS systems short and longterm billing strategies interfacing CRM and CIS meter reading advances and a technology forecast for the industry In addition more than vendors are expected to provide overviews of their service offerings at the conference The billing customer care market is arguably one of the most competitive and complex businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation Yet it is certain that this market will only become more complex and competitive as deregulation continues to unfold in the United States and internationally Hopefully this weeks CIS conference will provide valuable insights into the direction in which this fundamental part of the energy industry is headed TOMORROW Overview of former

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIntroduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corps CEO Chris Hamilos President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this morning at the th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque NM The st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career and reiterated his strong support for his son President George W Bush whom he affectionately refers to as as in rd president The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy However the former president did field questions from the audience regarding a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he faced in his administration and those that are presently challenging his son Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current presidents justreleased energy task plan a page report that outlines approximately steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia The former president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against Saddam Hussein who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world Further President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his presidency during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress that saw the big picture issues in a different light often made it difficult to find common ground The former president made only brief but rather significant references to his sons new energy policy Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney last evening former President Bush said he was aware that the new broadbased plan focused heavily on new supply along with secondary measures for conservation efforts This is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that if you want to lower energy prices you need to establish more supply In addition the former president offered that additional drilling efforts an element of the plan that has sparked a great deal of controversy has to happen if the nation is truly committed to increasing supply However former President Bush did suggest that the nation must be patient as it will take several years to see any significant decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new development efforts Meanwhile the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate As expected the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge easing of cleanair rules that should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit process for oil refinery expansion and construction These platforms have been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan However new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few days are raising the most eyebrows For instance the extent to which nuclear power factors into the administrations energy plan is perhaps greater than was previously anticipated Specifically the Bush plan proposes the extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of socalled breeder reactors which use spent nuclear fuel Breeder reactors although rather common in Europe and Japan have not been used in the United States since the s when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce nuclear weapongrade plutonium as a byproduct Other key elements of the plan include Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government which would supersede states rights to approve new transmission line capacity Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting and speeding up the relicensing requirements for nuclear plants Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury which are common byproducts of coalfired production In turn the Bush administration supports exploring new cleancoal technologies which should increase production by coalfired generating plants A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air Act which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power plants The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued As has been the case since the start of the new administration the continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts However the specific conservation proposals in the energy plan include providing consumers billion in tax credits through to encourage the purchase of highmileage gaselectric hybrid vehicles In addition President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to cogeneration plants which produce both heat and electricity Others including the current presidents father might argue that conservation efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as market forces high prices already are driving renewed conservation across the country Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that often thwarted his policy measures the current President Bush continues to buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy plan In fact just two days ago a group of House Democrats led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMiss outlined a plan that calls for increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan However Democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles Consequently the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and Democrats to support cooperation in Congress That cooperation may be necessary as Congress must approve President Bushs energy plan in order for it to take effect TOMORROW Summary of CIS Conference and analysis of key IT issues facing the energy

closed today in Albuquerque Over the past three days the conference focused on the changes that deregulation will continue to necessitate alongside the IT side of the energy industry As various software and customer management companies identified their unique service offerings in the exhibit hall of the conference an important dialogue exchange also occurred that highlighted new trends and challenges that utilities and retail companies will continue to face with regard to customer care At the conference I spoke with executives from a good number of the companies that are directly involved in the CIS space including Excelergy Peace Software LODESTAR Orcom Enlogix and Itron among many others Through these conversations several common denominators emerged that highlight a list of key drivers that will continue to shape this market The CIS space has become intensely competitive over the last two years and will continue to offer additional opportunities for new business models In the exhibit hall over companies were featured some of which have been around since before deregulation and others that have just emerged within the last year or so The vast majority of the companies represented fell into one of two categories software license companies or operations that offer total customer management support on an outsourced basis In particular we are finding that companies capable of multiservice offerings across multiple verticals electricity gas water waste management etc have a market edge over competitors that are more squarely focused on a single commodity In addition opportunities for CIS implementation appear to be far greater in Europe and Asia when compared to North America Although activity in North America is expected to increase many of the companies I spoke with are currently more aggressive across Europe and Asia The debate over software licensing versus outsourced customer management support continues within this segment of the energy industry A utility or retail operation basically has three choices build its own CIS modify existing legacy system purchase bestofbreed capability software licensing or outsource the full customer management Much of the decision between software licensing outsourcing lies within the business model that the utility or retail company has established for itself and its own capability of managing customer data without external support Many customer management support companies would offer that as retail operations begin to expand into various markets the complexities among various state regulations require outsourced customer management support Certainly the cost investment is another key factor driving the CIS decision made by a utility or retail company Many energy companies are hesitant about CIS and customer management implementation because they fear the system will become obsolete in three to five years and the company will be forced to write off its investment Consequently most energy companies are aggressively searching for an offtheshelf product that is adaptable and can be expected to still be around in years if such a product exists The overall hesitancy to invest in a CIS solution is part of the explanation why only a handful of significant contracts among utilities and software license companies outsource companies have been announced to date Within the various business models utility operations have a different approach to CIS Generator companies which typically have less than customers have a primary need to store customer information that is easily accessed and therefore do not typically need a largescale CIS However wires and retail operations are the key markets for advanced CIS and CRM platforms Wires companies which need to administer the data for a large number of customers need CIS systems that focus on work management outage processing and billing of either enduse customers or market participants Wires companies only have a need for CRM if state law allows marketing by the incumbent wires affiliate of the utility This trend may subside in time as more retail operations assume the responsibility for marketing Like wires companies retail operations also need to administer the data for many customers The requirements of retail operations focus on commodities plus valueadded products and services Within the systems employed by retail operations innovative and robust pricing applications are a must Retail companies also use CRM systems in which market intelligence sales automation campaign management and customer profiling are high priorities EDI will be replaced by XML As the transition is made from legacy systems to fourthgeneration client service solutions XML will replace for communicating large complex documents and information This process is currently taking place and will most likely continue for the next year or so XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible However the future remains open and it is anyones guess what will eventually replace XML California has thrown a real scare into the IT industry nationwide Most of the CIS executives present at the conference agreed that the uncertainty of deregulation that emerged as a result of the California crisis has cast a pall over the nearterm future for CIS opportunities As other states possibly slow down or abandon their restructuring plans many software and outsource companies admit that this could have an impact on their business and the CIS market as a whole A number of factors impact whether or not a company operating in the CIS space would be impacted by a return to regulation These include limitations put into place by legislative and regulatory bodies the business model of the company and its technical capabilities to operate in both a deregulated and regulated environment Ironically despite the slowdown new competitors continue to emerge mostly based on the belief that the need for a new CIS is building under pentup demand and will break soon In addition the renewed emphasis on power supply as included in the Bush administrations energy plan has positive IT implications according to some of the attendees at the conference As more power is produced and delivered to enduse customers the need for data management and billing solutions also increases Other trends that will continue to drive the CIS market include The rapid growth of the Internet as the primary form of communications media FERCs Order which is sparking the continuing emergence of RTOs ISOs transcos The simplified rate structures will make it easier to bill a transmission tariff The business lines among utility companies will become more clearly separated and consolidation among the lines will most likely occur This separation and consolidation process will impact the opportunities available for CIS companies the available market will shrink Retail customers will be turned over to new entities outside of the incumbent utility which will also impact CIS opportunities Outsourcing efficiencies should improve which will heighten the ongoing debate between software licensing or outsourcing full customer management support Moreover attendees at the CIS conference generally agreed that customer relationship management begins with effective management of the customer as its core Customer management includes the millions of transactions that must be accurately recorded bills that must be disseminated recovered and stored and competitive customer data that is critical to a the operations of a utility or retail company As deregulation not only opens up new opportunities for the companies operating in the CIS space it also is forcing these companies to become more flexible adaptable and opening to forming partnerships that would have seemed quite unlikely in past years Consequently the CIS market continues to change at a very rapid pace and it is hard to predict what players will become visible at next years th Annual CIS Conference One thing remains clear however As the complexities of customer billing and management become more intense the role of software providers and data management outsource

federal government is optimistic that Enron Corp NYSE ENE and the Maharashtra state government will resolve their wrangle which has jeopardized the US energy giants billion power project Indian lenders want their federal government to intervene after a threat by Enron Corp the countrys largest foreign investor to walk out of a giant power project has put the loan of the Indian groups in jeopardy Local lenders including the Industrial Development Bank of India and the countrys largest commercial bank State Bank of India stand to lose billions if Enron pulls out the deal On May Enron took a major step toward pulling the plug on the project by issuing a notice to terminate its contract to sell power to the Maharashstra state Analysis This news item is significant for two reasons First Enrons ongoing troubles in India are causing other power companies to also scramble from their investments in the country or avoid India altogether This comes at an unfortunate time for the undeveloped country as it was hoped that the investment from Enron and other companies would provide a significant financial boost to Indias energy infrastructure Second it is rather ironic that Enron which has gained an earnings boon from its wholesale and trading activities in the United States has faced financial challenges overseas by following the one business strategy that it has mostly avoided in this country owning hard generation assets By way of background Enron was first approached by the Maharashtra government back in regarding the joint development of a new power project to serve the western part of India In the mids Enron broke ground on the MW project on Indias western coast near Bombay which is the capital of Maharashtra that reportedly will be the largest natural gasfired power project in the country upon its completion Some reports suggest that it is the largest naturalgas plant in the world The plant is in the midst of its first operational phase with MW up and running and is scheduled to begin its second phase MW in June The company that owns and operates the power project is Dabhol Power Company in which Enron holds a percent interest the state of Maharashtra owns the other percent Under terms of the contract the state of Maharashtra agreed to purchase the totality of power produced at Enrons plant However problems began to surface over the last six months or so heightened by Maharashtras recent default on payments to Enron Dabhol Power has been criticized for charging rupees per kilowatthour compared with the markets average of rupees for conversion purposes equals rupees Citing what it claimed were high costs charged by Dabhol the state of Maharashtra reportedly refused to pay for any power produced from the second phase of the Dabhol plant At last count the state government owes Enron approximately million for power transactions completed last December and January and could owe million if the contract is terminated Citing payment defaults by the state of Maharashtra and noncooperation from both the state and federal government in India Enron issued a preliminary notice to terminate future power sales from its Dabhol plant Enron also declared a state of force majeure a legal strategy that allows a company to break a contract for reasons beyond their control In response Indian leadersdriven by valid concerns about the financial repercussions that a broken contract would haveare requesting the countrys federal government to intervene and prevent any break in the contract Lenders such as the State Bank of India the countrys largest commercial bank also plan to fight Enron on its plans to rescind the contract As noted Enrons problems in India are causing a damaging domino effect for the undeveloped country Being the international energy giant that it is Enron probably wont suffer too much if it does indeed terminate its contract with the Indian government and perhaps can find another buyer in the country for the power produced by the Dabhol plant Enron also has reportedly pulled out from all of the other projects in India in which it had once planned to invest including Metgas a liquefied naturalgas pipeline and Indiabased projects led by Enron Broadband Services and Enron Oil Gas This ongoing divestiture in India should reduce the companys risk exposure related to the countrys instability On the other hand the failed contract will most likely do a fair amount of damage to the energy market in India which is already perceived as a less than lucrative country in which to develop power projects Some reports have indicated that India received only billion in foreign investment in representing three times less than Singapore a country representing only onefourth of the economy of India Any deterrent toward further power expansion in India would exacerbate concerns about the countrys ability to meet growing demand for electricity Further at least four foreign power companies Cogentrix of the United States EDF of France Powergen of the United Kingdom and Daewoo Corp of South Korea already have pulled out of the Indian energy market At the same time many domestic companies also have postponed their own power projects as a result of legal obstacles In addition to a tainted reputation Indian leaders also stand to lose financially as well as loans given to the Indian government reportedly are not covered by any guarantee unlike overseas lenders who are protected by guarantees Enrons announcement that it intends to terminate the contract has triggered a cooling period that will last for six months during which time the Indian federal government will continue trying to convince Enron to maintain its end of the contract Interestingly in early May Enron said that it had no immediate plans to sell its stake in the Dabhol power project and added that it would make no move on the plant until the payment disputes with the state of Maharashtra are resolved Other statements made by Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay have suggested that the company might continue to own the Dabhol project and proceed with the completion of the second phase regardless of any payment that Maharashtra may or may not make Given the sharp increase in demand that is expected in India it would make sense for Enron to want to retain its majority ownership of the power plant and work a deal to sell its power to another Indian buyer Enron has been fairly consistent with regard to its strategy of not owning hard assets on any longterm basis Typically Enron has accumulated infrastructure in various commodities eg electricity generation natural gas bandwidth in order to ensure that it can provide a product where the customer wants it However once Enron has established itself within that commodity all it really needs is access to the infrastructure rather than outright ownership so divestiture has typically followed The company might have perceived the Indian market to offer unique opportunities due to the lack of infrastructure across the country However now it appears that Enrons majority ownership in the Dabhol plant may be causing more for the company than the assets are worth The possible termination of the Dabhol contract with the state of Maharashtra would mark the third sales deal that Enron has broken in recent months Most recently the company announced that it is bowing out of billion project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates and has sold its stake in Dolphin Energy to UAE Offsets Group for an undisclosed amount In addition Enron is being sued by a group of California universities over the schools claim that the company breached a fouryear contract signed in to provide power at a percent discount to the utility rate frozen by Californias deregulation law Scheduled to expire in the deal between Enron and the California university system included a peak power load of MW and is estimated to be worth about million Although Enron cited problems associated with Californias energy crisis once in court the company disclosed that the contract with the California universities no longer represented an economic business strategy and that the company was actually losing money on the contracts although it would not confirm a specific amount An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

National Competitor or Master of Its Domain By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEAt an annual meeting of shareholders on May Southern Companys NYSE SO new CEO Allen Franklin said the company will become a dynamic growing superregional energy company that emphasizes customer service and shareholder value In addition to maintaining and improving its annual dividend of per share Franklin disclosed that moving forward Southern Company will implement a new business strategy which focuses geographically on serving states in the socalled super Southeast Franklin also noted that the new strategy concentrates on Southern Companys regulated retail business which represents percent of the companys business Analysis Two recent and significant events at Southern Company set the stage for this pronouncement of a new strategy for the energy company based in Atlanta The spinoff of its highly successful Mirant Corp NYSE MIR six weeks ago and the simultaneous retirement of former CEO Bill Dahlberg which led to the appointment of new CEO Franklin make the timing right for Southern to reestablish its vision in the industry However it seems to me that there is not much that is new about Southern Companys recently unveiled business strategy which primarily focuses on growth within Southeast US states In fact for the last decade Southern has kept its regulated operations squarely focused on its service territory put little emphasis on US expansion and contributed to the Southeast regions general reluctance to deregulate Yet now even as national energy competitors grow larger and larger Southern Companys strong local presence and vertical integration approach may ultimately prove to be the smartest strategy of all It was only four years ago as the first group of deregulated markets began to operate that Southern Company billed itself as a pound gorilla implying that its number of customers and generation assets represented a formidable challenge to any other electric operation in the nation This was a view that was shared by most observers Before consolidation and mergers and acquisitions began to accelerate it was generally thought that Southern Company was the energy operation to beat in terms of scale and market prominence However the energy industrys playing field has changed dramatically since that time Now Southerns stats MW of generation million customers and market capitalization of billion are trumped or rivaled by the likes of AEP and Exelon companies that also span a much wider operational base than Southern Company Granted Southern Company has not sat around idly over the last four years and let competitive opportunities pass it by Mirant Corp formerly Southern Energy has been quite aggressive on a global and national scale Yet this formerly unregulated subsidiary of Southern Company is now a billion standalone company that is still riding on the glory of a strong IPO current MIR shares are priced at as of May following its October IPO price of Now Southern Company proceeds on its own with a strategy that is in many ways a recycling of what has been a slow growth but successful formula for its regulated operations The company says it will focus on its five regulated utilities Alabama Power Georgia Power Gulf Power Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric and unregulated power generation and energy products in the Super Southeast The focus on unregulated power generation through which Southern reportedly plans to add another MW by most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as Southern Nuclear and Southern Company Energy Solutions Moreover Southern appears perfectly content to maintain a strong local presence gain a healthy dividend on its regional utility operations and hold uncontested market power throughout its service territory Who could blame them This has been a lucrative business model for the company for some time Southerns Q earnings excluding contributions from Mirant were million or cents per share compared with million or cents per share in Q Further the company holds an exemplary relationship with customers receiving the highest ranking in overall customer satisfaction according to a recent study and local regulatory commissions However this business model should not be referred to as a new strategy Southern Company has always been a superregional operation with its own profitable niche that remains clearly defined The difference nowin addition to expanding from four to states in the same regionis that Southern may very well be on the right track and positioned to have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold As noted one of the consistent criticisms of Southern is that it has remained too focused on its service territory of the Southeastern United States and through this prominence in the region has prevented other companies from penetrating Southerns region This is a criticism that has also been leveled at Duke Energy Southerns neighbor to the north which has a lock on the Carolinas FERC recently rejected Southerns proposed SeTrans Gridco the companys proposal for a regional transmission organization and told the energy company not to reapply until it had explored joining neighboring utilities in an RTO such as GridSouth and GridFlorida which have already been conditionally approved by FERC This was a clear message to Southern that it would not be allowed to operate as its own electric island Of course FERCs policy is that transmissionowning utilities should voluntarily participate in an RTO but at the same time the commission would have control over Southerns market power in the region should the energy company ever want to merge with or acquire another utility Ironically just as Southern has maintained market power in the Southeast it has taken advantage of opportunities from deregulation in other states On the wholesale side Mirant is one company that has witnessed a financial windfall from California In addition Southern Company is now moving into Florida its first expansion outside of its service area after receiving preliminary approval to build a MW naturalgas generation facility in Orlando Further Southern Companys dominance in the Southeast has often been cited as one of the causes of the regions general sense of lethargy when it comes to electric competition None of the four states in which Southern is currently active Alabama Georgia Florida and Mississippi has formally adopted any sort of restructuring plan Generally these states have decided to take waitandsee approach although this philosophy actually predated the California energy crisis Granted insufficient transmission lines leading to the Southeast and the uncertainties about whether or not regulators will allow the costs associated with transmission construction to be recovered also have contributed to the lack of competition in the Southeast However regardless of the causal factors the end result is that Southern Company holds what is perhaps the largest uncontested market share in the country Consequently after being criticized and questioned for its rather conservative and restricted approach Southern Company now sits on the sidelines of a growing energy crisis from which it is remarkably immune As a growing number of states consider a return to regulation and industry analysts debate the prudence of deregulating the energy industry at all the trend may be returning full circle to a market structure that Southern Company has consistently exemplified In hindsight the business model that Southern has steadfastly pursued is now hard to criticize considering the uncertainty of many other national markets For instance Southern retains a solid customer base that is in little danger of being penetrated by competitors Mirant has successfully spun off as its own standalone company with the ability to attract investors based on its strong capital appreciation Southern Company also remains a strong operation with a solid rateofreturn and dividend for shareholders attracting its own set of investors The companys vertically integrated model has been retained and there have been no indications that Southern Company faces a supply shortage Expansion into other markets such as Florida and California has expanded Southerns base while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region For all of these factors Southern Company may prove to have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market Southern probably wont become a national player as utility operations of comparable size clearly aspire toward However it arguably has never been part of Southerns strategy to be a national player beyond what it achieved through Mirant when the company was still a subsidiary Focusing exclusively on the super region of the Southeast appears to be providing a remarkable rateofreturn for Southern In closing the companys strategy reminds me of the tortoise and the hare story While other companies have rushed to merge grow bigger and expand across the country Southern has taken a more methodical approach which may also get it across the finish line before many other competitors An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility

Pursues Italys Montedison Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEPower giant Electricitde France EDF has sent shock waves through Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise its stake in electric firm Montedison to percent from about percent However Romano Prodi the European Union commissioner for competition is considering an intervention in the battle between EDF the French electricity monopoly and the Italian government The latter has passed an ad hoc law restricting EDF to percent of the voting rights for Montedison the Italian electricity supplier spun off by Enel Analysis Once again the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the European power market with EDF playing the staring role For the last year or so as the European Union EU has enacted electric competition across the Continent Frances EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by foreign suppliers Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through its ownership of London Electricity the French power firm has wanted for some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy However the neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market As I have mentioned before in this column France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country As a result EDF which controls approximately percent of the French electric industry may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad until it further opens its own market to competition To date France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the EU and EDF has played a large role in this resistance While other European countries such as Germany have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although other companies such as Spains Endesa have attempted to push through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country Nevertheless EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its holdings in Montedison one of Italys main electricity companies Reports are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison EDF recently said that its stake increased from percent to percent However other reports have indicated that EDF already controls about percent of the capital assets of Montedison Both increases in Montedison were made recently which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market regulatory Consob EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the companys financial assets across Europe However at the same time EDF has also indicated that any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading purposes In other words EDF wants to control the generating assets of Montedison for resale across Europes wholesale market Further with a percent stake EDF would become Montedisons largest shareholder and a major presence in Italys power market even as France remains mostly closed EDFs argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian government The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators In fact EDF has admitted that its strategy is to make percent of its turnover from activities abroad by the end of compared with percent currently Consequently it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its home country for expansion opportunities and these opportunities typically have been in distribution and generation assets Moving forward the company has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation For instance last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for the regional UK electricity company Seeboard which is owned by American Electric Power NYSE AEP Serving about two million connected customers in England Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables An acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDFs overall expansion efforts in Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales which EDF bought from Entergy in In addition EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden Graninge and Germany EnBW and reportedly is Polands largest electricity distributor These acquisitions were made by EDF International which is wholly owned by the French government and thus subject to EU oversight Perhaps due to EDFs size and presence in Europe these previous acquisitions were allowed without a great deal of EU intervention However now that other countries have voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede it is unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny As noted trading appears to be the next wave of EDFs expansion efforts Toward this end EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in to create an energy trading company called EDF Trading The various companies that EDF has invested in across Europe support the companys efforts to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across the Continent For its part the Italian government has responded that it will block any increase of EDFs ownership of Montedison based primarily on the argument that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France Specifically Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison Further outlining its position the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be sold by Enel one of the countrys main power firms As Montedison will be one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel the Italian government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and thus having access to additional power assets in Italy For instance Enel is planning to sell Elettrogen a generation company that produces about percent of the production capacity in Italy If EDF were to increase its stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen then EDF as a foreign entity would gain a lock over the Italian power supply market Italys antiEDF law is an interesting development but it does not mark the first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent Spain also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with regard to the French companys pursuit of Hidrocantabrico Spains fourth largest supplier However despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict any expansion of EDF the laws although they are already in place may ultimately be deemed anticompetitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates antitrust allegations in the United States any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles EDF also remains interested in the Spanishs largest power utility Endesa which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the French electricity market through a percent acquisition of French electricity generator SocieacutetNationale dElectricitet de Thermique Endesa which recently terminated an attempted merger with Iberdrola Spains second largest power firm has been viewed as a takeover target for larger companies such as EDF At last report the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on how far control was being exercised In other words EU intervention will be based on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an increased stake in Montedison The fact that France remains resistant to electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the governments of Italy and Spain An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North

Analysis IMAGE With California facing a summer of anticipated power outages Gov Gray Davis and President George W Bush met for approximately minutes on May to discuss the states energy crisis in general and a federal cap on wholesale energy prices in particular Davis did not win any concession during the brief meeting in which he reportedly reiterated his contention that Texas energy producers have engaged in price gouging in California In fact after the meeting Gov Davis said On the thing that really matters above all others price caps Im disappointed that we still have a fundamental disagreement Analysis For once its rather easy to imagine myself as a fly on the wall during this muchanticipated meeting between the nations leader and the leader of the nations most populous state The firmly held positions of both President Bush and Gov Davis have been so well defined and articulated over the last few months that it is not hard to speculate on how their brief conversation unfolded Unfortunately their positions are currently so far apart that any compromise on the key issue of Western wholesale price caps shows little chance of being reached Once again the issue appears to be headed to court with Gov Davis having now confirmed that he will bring suit against FERC Meanwhile what was previously perceived as Californias problem has now become a national concern and one of the issues if not the main issue on which the political reputations of both Bush and Gray currently depend For clarity and to establish why compromise is so unattainable lets crystallize the philosophical gulf that exists between Bush and Davis Although the issues surrounding Californias energy crisis are complex the main issue on which Bush and Davis disagree is rather simple price caps or no price caps Gov Davis claims that Californians have been unfairly charged nearly billion since January and acknowledges that his own plan to keep Pacific Gas Electric Co out of bankruptcy failed The governor also pointed to a record price of MWh that the state paid for power last week compared with an average price of MWh in the spring of Thus Davis wants the Bush administration to enforce federal law by making FERC put wholesale price caps into place for a period of six or seven months long enough to get past the summer power crunch The temporary price cap also would allow for the four power plants that are already under construction in the state to come online FERC already has instituted a price cap for times when Californias power reserves fall below percent but Davis has argued that this approach is not sufficient Davis argument is based on the belief that FERC has not fulfilled its federal obligation to ensure just and fair electricity prices In an interesting development Davis has gained some influential support regarding his plea for price caps from a consortium of ten economists including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn generally considered the father of deregulation In a letter sent to the president late last week Davis and the group of economists claimed that FERCs failure to act soon on the issue of price caps will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back potentially fatally the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country In contrast President Bush along with Vice President Cheney maintain that price caps wont solve the power shortage and in fact would only do further damage to Californias power problems as price restrictions would discourage further production In addition Bush has argued that the core of Californias problems is a supply demand imbalance something that price caps would do nothing to solve Vice President Cheney has said that price caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply resulting in more blackouts for California this summer Further Bush has argued that California officials including Davis predecessor Pete Wilson are responsible for the states power woes and that the only real solution is a combination of increased supply and conservation efforts The subtext of the Bush administrations approach to the California power crunch is that the problem can be solved in time but not with temporary bandaids Under the recently released federal energy plan President Bush has outlined a plan to increase power supply over the next years fueled by traditional and nontraditional sources Bushs approach to California is that in time increased production and transmission capacity upgrades will rectify the states current supply demand imbalance Affixing temporary price caps according to Bush would do no good and could cause a great deal of damage While touring California President Bush announced a proposed expansion of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which provides special help to cashstrapped residents of California and other states Funding of this program which requires congressional approval would increase by million adding to the alreadybudgeted million Gov Davis again responded that this measure was inadequate and reiterated that all California wants is for Bush to invoke the federal power that only he has as president and provide shortterm relief to the state Gaining momentum for Bushs travels in California Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham weighed in on the California debate on May Abraham stated that the states problems were not just a result of insufficient supply but also related to poor transmission capacity As such Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration a federal agency to finish its pending plans for increasing capacity along the socalled Path an mile stretch of power lines that presently is insufficient to carry the necessary load between Northern and Southern California Bottleneck problems along Path have been cited as a main cause of power outages in the central part of the state Remaining at issue is whether or not there will be enough funding to support a new transmission line along Path Of course politics continue to play a key role in this ongoing saga Both Bush and Davis have seen their approval ratings dip as a result of the power crisis and are seeking redemption and a place to transfer blame A Field Poll released last week indicated that President Bushs approval rating in California is at percent percent disapproving points behind the national average Gov Davis approval rating in the state is also at percent with disapproval coming in at percent a sharp decline from more favorable ratings held in January In addition remember that President Bush lost the state of California in Novembers election by as much as a point margin or more than one million votes It is also reported that Gov Davis may make a play for the presidential election in Further Davis has publicly singled out a handful of power suppliers such as Reliant and Enron which are based in Texas the presidents home state Now that any sort of compromise appears unlikely between California and the Bush administration Gov Davis has confirmed that he will pursue legal action against FERC hoping to force it to honor rulings that electricity prices in California were unjust and unreasonable Further Davis indicated that the US Senate soon to be Democratcontrolled would hold hearings into the soaring prices and perhaps be more responsive to the states claims The California State Legislature already has filed a suit against FERC claiming that the federal commission has failed in its efforts to stop what it already determined were unjust and unreasonable wholesale prices Nevertheless on May the th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to order FERC to cap wholesale prices in California responding to a sideline claim issued by the city of Oakland and two California legislators The threejudge panel of the court ruled that the appeal did not warrant intervention on the part of FERC However this ruling does not directly impact any additional lawsuits that are pending or might be filed Keep in mind that FERC continues to apply pressure on California to join RTO West the regional transmission organization that is overseeing transmission in the Pacific Northwest California officials have maintained that they want the California ISO to remain independent Consequently California and FERC may reach a deal sooner than Gov Davis and President Bush as a tradeoff between price caps and California joining RTO West could become the muchsoughtafter compromise On the record FERC officials share the Bush administrations opposition to price caps but Chairman Curt Heacutebert has previously indicated that he is open to the use of price caps as a temporary solution An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGETwo mainstays of the Northwests economypublic power and the aluminum industryFwaging a war of words over the Bonneville Power Administrations attempts to set rates for the electricity it sells Both sides have hired public relations companies in their attempts to sway publi c opinion before the federal power marketing agency sets new electricity rate s effective Oct BPA which sells power produced at federal hydroelectr ic dams and a nuclear plant has signed contracts for about MW but has generating capacity for only MW To help make up the MW shortfall BPA is pushing a plan to idle the regions aluminum smelters for two years until additional generating capacity comes online Analysis Given the barrage of media coverage that continues to hang over Californias energy problems the fact that the Pacific Northwest is suffering from its own related maladies is often overlooked Perhaps the mo st extreme case that illustrates the severity of problems to the north of California is the BPA which in addition to attempting to increase its wholesale rates by as much as percent this fall is now unable to fulfil l many of its longterm power contracts Much like Pacific Gas Electric and Sierra Pacific Resources before it the BPA now stands among a handful of power firms in the West that have sustained devastating financial blows due to volatility of the regions market However unlike investorowned utilities IOUs BPA is owned by the federal government and as such has be en criticized for having access to federal funding and protection not extended to other Western power victims It is important to remember that BPA is a federal organization that was formed in to market power from the Bonneville Dam It holds a lock on approximately percent of the Pacific Northwest power market and is one of the primary providers of power to incumbent utilities in the area such as Tacoma Power and Seattle City Light In the s the BPA experienced an excess of power and sought power contracts outside the Pacific Northwest in order to retain a positive cash flow and support various programs to ensure the lives of salmon and steelhead which populate the Bonneville Dam The BPA formed contracts with such outofregion buyers as Enron Avista Energy and the main California utilities The BPA signed longterm contracts to sell MW of hydropowerenough to light the city of SeattleFutilities outside the Pacific Northwest and to private power marketers adding to the base of its contracts with Northwest utilities and Ccustomers mostly aluminum manufacturers However these contracts have aggravated regional power problems in a new era of shortages and soaring prices For the most part BPAs troubles have stemmed from weatherrelated circumstances unlike California and Nevada where weather has served to exacerbate fundamental restructuring problems The Pacific Northwest whic h relies heavily on hydropower has suffered one of its worst droughts in recent history which has greatly compromised what has typically been a reliable and abundant power source In fact the Northwest is reportedly between MW and MW short of the power it needs Further power that the Northwest could typically rely upon from California and the Southwest to supplement any shortage it might encounter in its own territor y is no longer available due to power demands in other states Given its role as the primary power supplier to the regions utilities the BPA has become increasingly vulnerable to the volatility of the spot market The end resul t is that BPA which clearly overextended itself regarding power contracts formed in the last decade has been forced to either buy expensive power on the spot market to serve its customers or negotiate buyouts of its power obligations The BPA also has traditionally sold power directly to industrial customers and over the last few months has attempted to rescind many of those contracts For instance the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company a Kalispell Montbased aluminum manufacturer has agreed not to use average MW of the average MW BPA had agreed to sell it from October to September Reportedly the BPA has bought back the power under contract to Columbia Falls for MWh This marked the second industrial customer that has allowed the BPA to terminate a power contract following a deal wi th Alcoa another aluminum producer in which the BPA bought back about average MW Typically the Ccustomers have agreed to break their contracts with the BPA due to their own halted production schedules that have resulte d from soaring power costs However aluminum production is a critical part of the Northwests economy and several lobbying groups have emerged to block the BPA from negotiating with any additional aluminum manufacturers to cease production Arguing tha t the BPA has an obligation to fulfill its power contracts the advocacy groupscomprised of public power and manufacturing representativesF attempting to secure some form of legal restriction against the BPA before the agency increases rates this fall Without knowing the terms of the contracts it is not clear whether BPA has an exit clause that entitles it to stop providing power to the various buyers Regarding its Northwest customers which are given priority to BPA power supplies the BPA has requested that these utilities implement conservation programs to reduce the amount of power that must be purchased on the wholesale market Nevertheless the BPA has already disclosed that it will be forced to increase rates by as much as percent this October to cover it s spot market power purchases a condition that echoes similar movements by PGOand Sierra Pacific Resources BPA reportedly charges its utility customers about MWh for electricity Wholesale electricity on the spot market is now selling at between to MWh and wholesale power sold through longterm contracts sells for to MWh Consequently the percent increase could be the minimum at which the BPA raises its rates which would in turn impact the retail rates that Northwest utilities must charge their customers PacifiCorp recently became the first IOU under contract with the BPA to voluntarily reduce load on the federal agency Under the agreement PacifiCorp has released BPA from its commitment to sell the utility an average of MW each year for the next five years Other IOUs are not acquiescing to the BPAs proposal For instance the BPA informed Southern California Edison SCE that it would not provide MW of power this summ er to the utility under the terms of a previously reached agreement The BPA which unilaterally changed the terms of the contract from a strict sales agreement into an exchange when SCE began to have its own financial problem s has argued that SCE has ceased providing needed power to the BPA As a result the BPA will provide no further power to SCE unless it receives financial guarantees in advance SCE has deemed this threat as a potential breach of contract and is currently pursuing the matter in the th Circuit US Court of Appeals Moreover the crux of the matter presently is the dichotomy that BPA represents in a deregulated energy market On one hand BPA is a federally protected agency with access to federal funding and control over federal lands On the other hand BPAunlike any other federal agencycontrols about half of the Northwests energy supply and in the past has profited from power sales to other regions mostly California In addition to the growing resistance from public power and aluminum groups ov er BPAs plan to increase rates other groups have raised the claim that BPA i s receiving preferential treatment from the federal government Some critics find it inconsistent that the Bush administration supports free market principles in the West evidenced by the resistance to put wholesale price caps into place and increased production but at the same time might allow BPA to break longterm power contracts Such critics mostly clearly represented by the NortheastMidwest Institute a nonprofit Washington DC think tank believe the Bush administration should force BPA to sell its power to anyone who wants it at freemarket rates which of course are consistently higher than its current costbased rates In addition to potential rate increases the BPA is attempting to secure increased funding from the federal government As a federal agency the BPA is allowed to borrow from the federal treasury to support infrastructure upgrades such as transmission capacity and maintain federal dams that generate the BPAs power Recent reports have indicated that the BPA alread y is spending around billion in federal funds to modernize the regions power grid and will request an additional million from the federal treasury for transmission upgrades and to modernize existing powergenerati ng facilities Yet at the same time several regional groups are attempting t o block any increase in the BPAs access to federal funds arguing that the administration has continuously lowered its annual payments into the treasu ry and therefore should not be entitled to a credit increase The BPA may not have directly caused the current power problems in the Northwest but it is clear that the federal agency engaged in overly optimistic power contracts that it now cannot fulfill Moving forward the question will be whether or not in a supposedly deregulated market the BP A should be governed by any special standards given its status as a federal agency or whether it should be held to the same rules that apply to IOUs While the forprofit economy of the Northwest is now in jeopardy due to volatile power prices stakeholders in the region object to the BPA being able to break contracts and increase rates Once again this appears to be another matter that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Bush administration to decide as part of the nations unfolding energy agenda An

California By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last Friday unanimously approved a comprehensive order on ways to fix Californias troubled marketplace Though some including Commissioner Curt Hbert hoped this order would be the final word FERC signaled that more work has to be done to reach market consensus on several issues including a new market structure for the state ANALYSIS Although some ongoing and larger issues remain this order does bring closure to FERCs proposed ruling from last month which had outlined several key remedies to repair what has roundly been called a flawed system in California FERC previously had determined that the dysfunctional market structure in the state had caused unjust and unreasonable rates for utilities that must purchase power on the wholesale market and enduse customers such as those in San Diego who no longer are protected by a rate freeze With a couple of important exceptions the Commission essentially gave a rubber stamp of approval to its proposed order that was issued on Nov after receiving input from participants throughout the energy industry As expected FERC adopted its soft rate cap of MWh In real terms this means that bids above this amount cannot set the market clearing price that is paid to other bidders for power on the wholesale market The rate cap is referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all other generators will receive Any generato r setting a bid above MWh must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny FERC also officially adopted a policy that removes restrictions against bilateral contracts in California and deemphasizes spotmarket activity Moving forward buyers and sellers in the California market no longer have to sell into and buy from the California PX Instead longterm contra cts may be established between power distribution utilities and power sellers Specifically FERC set into place a MWh target price for forward contracts This represented a new policy on the part of the Commission that had not previously been outlined in its proposed order and was the source of a great deal of contention within FERC Commissioner Linda Breath itt offered that the MWh target price could possibly set the standard for reasonableness However unlike the MWh rate cap for transactions on the open market prices below the target price of MWh will likely be accepted without the same level of scrutiny from FERC Higher prices may be subject to review A month ago FERC had proposed establishing independent nonstakeholder boards for the California Independent System Operator ISO and the PX This turned out to be more easily said than done and was one of the earlie r proposals from which FERC retreated in its final order Essentially FERC had wanted to replace existing members of the respective boards with new members not associated with the energy industry However the word is out that California Governor Gray Davis had put pressure on FERC to not adopt this policy because the governor himself wants to be able to choose new members for the boards that will be more sensitive to the needs of Califor nia consumers In the end FERC decided that a new governing structure for both the ISO and PX would be put into place by April of next year and would be established with the cooperation of the governor and other state officials Until that time the current board members will continue to act in an advisory capacity Signaling that FERCs final order will by no means close the book on the problems we are seeing in California Southern California Edison SCE immediately responded with deep disappointment to the Commissions order Specifically SCE claims that the order will do nothing to protect Californ ia consumers from the unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity prices that FERC already agreed were in existence in the state SCE previously had urged FERC to adopt costbased pricing rules meaning that each power seller would be able to bid into the market at variable operating costs FERC had taken this costbased approach with the initial operation of the restructured PJM pool which appears to be working rather well in that area However FERC did not adopt this approach for California and SCE contends that since November the soft rate cap of MWh has been in place and rates have continued to skyrocket Reportedly prices last week in California reached as high as MWh compared to an average of MWh which SCE claims was the price that it charged for power from its own plants during the month of December in previous years Thus SCE contends that FERC has not fulfilled its regulato ry obligation to repair the system in California and as a result a severe operational crisis in the state now appears inevitable Again as we saw with the proposed order dissension ran high within the FERC itself Commissioner Hbert reportedly felt that the final order was too timid and that it did not do enough to solve the problems in Californ ia FERC Chairman James Hoecker appeared to be open to regionwide rate caps which Hbert strongly opposed and said could

who by the way is rumored to become the next FERC chair dislikes any kind of rate cap and prefers instead to let market participant s manage their own exposure to price risk As I had discussed when I outlined the proposed order back in November see IssueAlert from Nov on wwwconsultrcicom I questioned whether or not FERC could reach any longterm solutions to Californias problems The lack of consensus regarding how to fix Californias dysfunctional marke t not only within the Commission but throughout the industry as a wholeonly seems to be growing FERC set out with the clear goal of bringing down energy prices for consumers but it is still questionable if this final order can accomplish that objective As SCE notes the soft price cap has done nothing to keep prices down in the state and concerns about power supply in California continue to increase In fact nearly every day during this month the California ISO has issued a stage one or two emergency warni ng indicating that operating reserves of power in the state are falling to alarming lows Consequently although this order attempted to reach resolution it still seems like there is little chance that we will see the end

LongTerm Objectives for Industry By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm ission FERC said that all US utilities must submit plans to the agency by Dec for joining regional transmission organizations RTOs or the fi rms and their affiliates would no longer be able to sell electricity in the wholesale market at marketbased rates Merger approvals for transmission owning utilities that do not join an RTO might also be restricted FERC Cha irman Pat Wood speaking at an agency meeting said he believed there shoul d be four RTOs nationwide one each covering the Northeast Southeast Midw est and Western markets To me at this point the four RTOs is a good pla ce to land Wood said Each RTO would oversee a regions electric grid to ensure all power suppliers had fair and equal access to transmission lines In addition to the aggressive timetable for RTO formation Wood also outli ned several priorities that are included in FERCs longterm agenda includ ing steps to reduce market manipulation and improve the industrys infrastr ucture Analysis In the transition from the former FERC under the leadership of Cu rt Hbert to current chairman Pat Wood it has often been projected that th e new commission would become more interventionist and carry a big stick to force utilities to comply with federal requirements Clearly this new d eclaration from Chairman Wood in his first substantial motion since becomi ng FERCs leader last month demonstrates just how commanding that stick ma y become along with the commissions unwavering commitment to the implemen tation of its comprehensive RTO plans Quite unlike his predecessor who so ught to reduce the extent to which FERC would regulate through his develop ing agenda Wood reportedly seeks to heighten the commissions role to the l evel of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commis sion In other words Wood wants FERC to create policy for the energy indus try and then aggressively implement it with RTOs being at the top of the l ist The difference of FERCs new approach to RTOs ie comparing Wood to Hbe rt cannot be overstated For the last several years FERC has been regular ly criticized for developing a policy toward RTOs that on paper called for voluntary participation by the nations transmissionowning utilities Wood is carving out a vastly different approach that ups the ante for RTO parti cipation and affixes stiff penalties for those utilities that fail to compl y The new motion makes Woods position very clear utilities that own tran smission assets must agree to turn those assets over to an RTO by Dec o f this yearjust over two months from nowor lose their authority to sell w holesale electricity at market rates In addition Wood has said that FERC should condition subsequent merger approvals on whether or not a transmissi onowning utility has complied with the commissions RTO order Interesting ly Wood maintains that FERCs evolving position on RTOs still calls for v oluntary participation among utilities However the new chairman clearly states that if utilities dont join RTOs they wont have access to the ben efits of competitive markets It is important to note that Wood acknowledges that the actual transfer of utility transmission assets may not occur for several years The new motion from Wood calls only for utilities agreements and specific plans to trans fer their transmission assets by Dec This proposal changes an earlier FERC order that preceded Wood in which the commission called for RTOs to ac tually become operational by Dec which the commission now apparently r ealizes is not feasible This big stick that FERC is now hanging over utilities does offer some be nefits as well as Wood has been quick to reiterate For instance FERC has already offered utilities higher regulated rates of return for transmissio n assets under RTO control In addition by turning the transmission assets over to an RTO utilities will be removed from state regulatory oversight of the assets Of course it is important to note that states still control retail rates which sets up many potential conflicts between federal and s tate regulatory policies There is also a separate measure that is coming t ogether in Congress that would eliminate the tax consequences utilities fac e when transferring their transmission assets to FERCapproved RTOs Utilit ies often cite the costs associated with transferring their transmission as sets to an RTO when resisting compliance with FERCs order If this federal legislation is passed transmissionowning utilities will have one less re ason to resist the transfer of their transmission assets over to an indepen dent entity It is important to note that Woods new proposals related to RTO formation are an adjunct to FERCs order from last July that mandated consolidation a mong existing RTOs with the stated goal of creating four large national en tities Northeast Southeast Midwest and West The Electric Reliability C ouncil of Texas ERCOT which already exists is outside of FERCs jurisdi ction Four large RTOs is still the vision that FERC has in mind and as no ted Wood agrees that four is a good place to land However the mandate o n consolidation appears to be softening at least in some regions For inst ance in the Western region presently three separate transmission entities exist the California ISO in California RTO West among the Northwestern s tates and Desert Star among the Southwestern states In its July order FE RC had clearly stated that it wanted to see these three entities consolidat e a point that has caused a great deal of conflict with the California ISO which wants to remain independent Now Wood appears to be backing away f rom forcing the consolidation issue in the West and has said that FERCs st ance will be not as aggressive for integrating the existing RTOs in the W est Further Wood now says that having a single Western RTO is not imperat ive at this time Consolidation among the existing RTOs in the Northeast appears to be moving forward In fact consolidation among the PJM Power Pool the New York ISO and the New England ISO could take place as soon as the end of next year This progress comes somewhat as a surprise considering that the last repor t out of this region was that the New York ISO and New England ISO resisted the preference that had been shown for PJMs model In the Midwest two en tities still exist the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO and Wood has sai d that FERC is working toward a revised agreement between the two entities that would encourage them to merge Just recently six investor and public owned power companies in the Midwest applied to FERC to form a new company to merge their electric transmission systems Translink Transmission Co w ould be a forprofit entity It is not presently known if or how Translink may be required to conjoin with the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO As noted Wood has also set out a longterm agenda for FERC covering other points beyond RTO formation For instance another critical issue for the commission will be potential market manipulation that might take place by v arious participants in deregulated environments One of the ongoing debates related to the failure of Californias deregulated market was whether or n ot outofstate generators or stateaffiliated entities such as the Califor nia ISO and the Department of Water Resources intentionally manipulated the states market to impact power prices Wood has indicated that FERC will s oon release a formal policy for policing companies authorized to sell power at market rates and utilities that use transmission services bundled into stateregulated retail rates to thwart wholesale power competition In addi tion Wood has said that FERC will establish new policies related to the in formation that energy companies can share with their affiliates This is a direct reference to a pending case involving El Paso Corp in which the co mpany has been accused of sharing marketsensitive information with one of its unregulated affiliates to gain a market edge in the naturalgas market of California The other key focus area for Wood is upgrading the electricity infrastructu re in the United States which he says has not even remotely kept pace with the tremendous growth in the economy over the last years Instead of bu ilding new power lines however it appears that Wood supports the developm ent of new technologies that would boost capacity on existing lines Toward that end FERC and the Department of Energy will hold a forum on innovativ e but unused energy technologies in January Also along these lines are pla ns to develop uniform strategies for hooking up existing and new power plan ts to the transmission grid Moreover as we head toward the end of we are fast approaching the fo uryear anniversary of the start of electric competition in the United Stat es California the first state to implement direct access opened its mark et in March Four years later the industry is still caught in somewh at of a limbo between the old structure of monopoly control and the new str ucture of full deregulation Chairman Wood has assumed leadership over FERC at a time when the commission has been heavily criticized for not doing en ough to limit the amount of market abuse that has arisen as a result of der egulation At the same time the extent to which the commission should prov ide regulatory oversight in a deregulated marketplace has also come under q uestion even by the commissioners themselves Thus Chairman Woods challe nge will be to push electric competition forward while taking steps to redu ce the potential for market manipulation Clearly RTOs continue to play an integral role in these objectives and remain a top priority for FERC under the new leadership of Pat Wood An archive list of previous

rciwsimagesIssueAlertLogojpg October Dynegy Remains on a Roll as Earnings Soar By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Power marketer and trader Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN announced that its thirdquarter earnings hit the upper end of Wall Street expectations as its backbone wholesale energy business delivered strong ret urns The company said earnings rose to million or cents per dilut ed share from million or cents per diluted share for the same pe riod in Analysts polled by Thomson Financial First Call had expecte d earnings in a range of cents to per share with a mean expectation of cents Analysis Dynegy has scored an impressive feat in beating its stellar finan cial performance over the course of Given the restrictions placed on power generators in California general market upheaval and impact on the e conomy that has resulted from the events of Sept one might have expect ed Dynegy to see its earnings dip slightly compared to its performance Quite to the contrary Dynegy has emerged once again as a bright star in a rather bleak financial galaxy demonstrating that its core focus on marke ting and trading along with a cautious approach into international markets and uncertain businesses such as telecom is a winning strategy Even in a weakened economy in which its own stock has fallen some percent over th e course of due in large part to market turmoil Dynegy still stands out as a leader in the energy field and almost singlehandedly has kept en ergy stocks high on the radar screen of Wall Street Dynegys numbers command attention In addition to its impressive Q report during the first nine months of Dynegy has earned million or a share compared with million or for the first nine mont hs of Dynegy also has raised its earnings estimate for yearend to a range of to per diluted share from the target set on Oct For Q and year Dynegy remains comfortable with its previous ly established target of to cents a share and to a share respectively The revised figures represent an increase of well over pe rcent for Dynegys projections for Further the company said that it remains confident that its projected earnings per share EPS growth rate o ver the next three years through will average percent to perce nt Without question the vast majority of earnings increase at Dynegy is being derived from the companys Marketing and Trade unit which Dynegy said acc ounted for more than percent of the Q profits In fact out of the million that Dynegy reported in the Q earnings million came fr om the marketing and trading division representing an increase of perce nt from Q Dynegy Marketing and Trade is engaged in a broad array of energy businesses including the physical supply of and risk management act ivities around wholesale natural gas power coal emission allowances and weather derivatives On the basis of the marketing and trade subsidiary Dynegy is currently ran ked as the fifth largest gas marketer in the country and its ongoing succe ss has resulted from a dual focus on naturalgas trading and power generati on For yearend Dynegy Marketing and Trade reported a percent in crease in recurring net income to million representing nearly perc ent of Dynegy Incs overall results The segments performance benefited f rom Dynegys expanded North American naturalgas and power operations incl uding the integration of Illinovas unregulated generation assets strong m arketing trading and risk management activities and a return to normal wea ther patterns Clearly this particular unit is the primary earnings driver for the entire company In the third quarter Dynegy Marketing and Trades North American naturalgas volumes grew percent to billion cubic feet per day Bc fd an increase from Bcfd during Q Also under the same unit total power sales increased percent to million MWh in Q comp ared to million MWh in Q This percent jump in total physical power sales led to an percent yearoveryear increase in recurring inco me for the marketing and trade division According to Dynegy the higher vo lumes in both gas and power were the result of improved market liquidity g reater market origination increased sales volumes on Dynegydirect and inc remental gas marketing in Canada Part of the expansion of this business will be an ongoing penetration of th e European trading market However Dynegy maintains that unlike its direc t competitor Enron its European expansion is methodical and cautious Dyne gy recently expanded its Dynegydirect trading portal into the United Kingdo m but its penetration of this market has been much slower than Enron whic h according to Dynegy tried to expand into the European market in a hurr y Another Dynegy rival is Reliant Energy which also expanded into Europe in advance of other companies and is now reportedly considering a sale of its electricity generation business in the Netherlands The comparison that Dynegy has made between itself and Enron may be intenti onal Along with being longtime Houstonbased rivals Dynegy must find its current success even sweeter considering the turmoil that has taken place at Enron over the last year Of course Enron lost its CEO Jeffrey Skilling just over a month ago when he resigned amid the companys diminished stock value and huge losses in the telecom sector Enron released its own Q ear nings report on Oct Enrons core wholesale trading and marketing divis ion met targets and drove up profits by percent The companys earnings also rose to million or cents a share from million or ce nts a share in Q However Enron posted a Q net loss as it faced billion in charges which included a million writedown on its Azu rix venture million from the restructuring of its broadband unit and million in investment losses related to The New Power Company What we know presently is that Enrons stock has dropped about percent over the course of due to its troubled broadband sector losses associated wi th its Dabhol subsidiary in India and overall downward market trends If there is something that could be considered a blemish on Dynegys curren t record it may be its telecom business known as Dynegy Global Communicat ions in which the company reported a million loss for the third quarte r Dynegy Global Communications seeks to capitalize on the growing converge nce between energy and communications sectors by building a broadband marke ting and trading system Dynegy has said that the loss is due to costs asso ciated with developing its mile bandwidth network which reaches US cities and is expected to be completed in the four quarter Unlike oth er power companies that are trying to exit the telecom sector Reliant for example Dynegy still projects that it will find longterm success in thi s area in part because it is taking a cautious approach toward expansion Also as another means of comparison with Enron Dynegys telecom business lost million in the third quarter while Enrons broadband unit took a l oss of million Another unit taking losses is Illinois Power Dynegys regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary which reported a mi llion loss in Q Dynegy attributed this loss to a reduced industrial load Perhaps the other area that may give pause to investors is Dynegys engagem ents in the California market which still remains unresolved Dynegy is re portedly still owed about to million for power that was sold to t he California utilities before the state government took over as the primar y power purchaser Despite Dynegys best efforts to obtain the outstanding balance and its confidence that it will ultimately be paid the financiall y unstable condition of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison makes the timetable for any such payment quite uncertain Also impac ting Dynegys California involvement are reports that California lawmakers want to renegotiate longterm agreements that the Department of Water Resou rces signed with various power suppliers including Dynegy earlier in the year Wholesale prices have dropped considerably since the state of Califor nia signed the longterm contracts and thus the state wants to renegotiate a better price for the power Dynegy claims however that the contract it signed with the state contains legal protection for Dynegys interests Overall however Dynegys Q financial report represents what is one of th e few unqualified success stories in the energy industry Stacked up agains t other companies that have struggled against the volatility of the nation s economy Dynegy is clearly flourishing Like other companies with heavy a ssets in generation the fact that Dynegys marketing and trading division is the primary profit driver for the company is not a revelation What is p erhaps more important is the diligent way in which Dynegy has methodically accumulated an arsenal of generation assets and expanded into new business lines with a very cautious approach An archive

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission F ERC kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r ules requiring utilities to turn control of their powergrid assets to inde pendent management The controversial effort to carve up the nations elect ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat ions RTOs is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III The workshop s dubbed RTO Week were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls buy in for the effort which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie s state regulators and members of Congress Analysis The objective of this weeks workshops may be to gain support fro m the industry for FERCs controversial mandate but they are also having t he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERCs jurisdic tional boundaries The issue has become rather evenly divided On one side critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order which as noted has become somewhat of a cause clbre for new Chairman Wood O n the other hand supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s uppliers into the nations transmission system By Woods own directive th e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin g point as a Dec deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u tilities is fast approaching Certainly the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman after replacing Curt H bert last month has signaled a new era for the federal commission which oversees much of the energy industrys wholesale market and the nations po wer grid As noted Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key objectives Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec by which time transmis sionowning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities Using what he has referred to as a big stick Wood warned that failing to comply with the D ec deadline would cost transmissionowning utilities their right to cha rge marketbased rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in which the utilities might become engaged This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand but has also sparked an inte nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul ating energy market Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints on FERCs authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional leaders who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers State regulators p articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ ely low argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is S uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight rather than c ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC and also believe t hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n ations transmission system is managed Also in question is the extent to w hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen d state boundaries Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERCs authority to force it to participate in an RTO In its July order FERC directed Southern Comp any along with the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Corp and Grid South to form a single RTO for the Southeast region most likely adopting a structur e modeled after Grid South However Southern Company already has sunk abou t billion into its own mile system over which it wants to retain independent control FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced However Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co uld run as high as million which could be passed on to customers in t he form of higher rates Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph ical point of view and questions whether or not the commissions vision of four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient On e of Southerns concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la rge and end up operating like monopolies Ironically the issue has caused dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant which as an i ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid Whil e Southern disagrees with FERCs authority to force RTO participation Mira nt supports the federal governments efforts to streamline transmission act ivity Leaders of RTO Westthe transmission entity in which FERC wants to include the transmission assets of states in the Northwest Southwest and Californi aalso question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC s authority to mandate this structure Leaders in the region have said tha t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates con sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity to meet high demand in the area In other words although FERC may be endor sing marketbased rates for those transmissionowning utilities that join R TOs some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre ased activity Nevertheless along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D ynegy and Enron which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems Hence t hese companies agree with FERCs emphasis on RTO formations as generation companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f rom utilities to independent management companies In addition to the RTO issue the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas E lectric Co have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio nal authority to a head The utilitys parent PGE Corp is pursuing a rin g fencing strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi ngs of Pacific Gas Electric Co Put simply PGE Corp is trying to prote ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new federally regulat ed subsidiary The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca use the California Public Utility Commission which presently regulates the utility operations of Pacific Gas Electric Co believes that it has the right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary Further th e state government in California believes that PGE Corps plan would give too much regulatory control to FERC and by the same token reduce the amou nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr esently contained in a regulated subsidiary The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder al legal system In fact last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen ts from federal lawyers state regulators and private industry addressing not only FERCs authority to mandate RTOs but also the commissions or der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s ystems Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat ion in an RTO At present the commission had danced around the issue by ca lling for voluntary participation yet still affixing stiff penalties for utilities that refuse to comply In addition Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the Energy and Air Qual ity Subcommittee is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session which cou ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl y November Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs and his draft bill repor tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr ivate utilities that own power lines At the same time however it is beli eved that Bartons draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERCs order which again w ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on transmission issues Moreover Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d ebate over FERCs authority as disputes between state and federal regulator y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge Howe ver given FERCs deadline of Dec for RTO participation the issue has gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in their heels and rebuff the federal commissions mandate An

System Operator ISO the New York ISO and the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland PJM Interconne ctionall of which were operating as separate organizations until two month s ago when they were essentially ordered to conjoin by FERC The Northeast region consists of states and the District of Columbia and combining th e various markets in the region would reportedly create the largest electri c power market in the world Thus if we look at the Northeast situation as a national template conjoining the various RTOs across the country into f our large regional entities per FERCs directive may be an arduous task In addition consolidation could add multiple layers of bureaucracy to what is already an extremely complex sector of the energy industry For background it is important to realize that the current challenges asso ciated with forming a single transmission entity stem from a FERC order rel eased last July ordering all of the existing RTOs in the country to explore consolidation The contentious order which has sparked intense controvers y among certain utilities and existing RTOs literally lays out the bluepri nt for how FERC wants the nations transmission systems to be constructed FERC has clearly directed four regional systems in the Northeast Southeas t Midwest and West although no reference was made to the Electric Reliab ility Council of Texas ERCOT which exists outside of FERCs jurisdiction and essentially operates as its own transmission island The commission ha d previously set a deadline of Dec for RTOs to become functional so most of the transmission entities impacted by the order were in the mi dst of formulating their operational plans when the order was issued on Jul y In the Northeast region FERC directed that a new Northeast RTO would be cr eated for this region and would essentially follow the template that has be en established by the PJM Interconnection which as noted operates the whol esale transmission market in Pennsylvania New Jersey and Maryland In fact FERC has often commented that PJM represents the most successful RTO that has been formed in the United States to date FERC has said that PJM shoul d serve as the platform or starting point for mediation talks in the Nort heast Under FERCs new order the existing New England and New York ISOs w ould be required to join PJM From the time that FERCs order was first rel eased I suspected that these two entities would resist FERCs mandate to j oin PJM as they have previously stated that a substantial amount of time a nd money has already been spent on forming their ISO entities and consolid ation could nullify those efforts It appears that my projections are now coming true While sincere efforts a re being made to consolidate the three transmission entities in the Northea st the parties involved are realizing that conjoining three large and sepa rate transmission organizations is a very complicated process The main obs tacles seem to surround structural and governing issues which I expect wil l also be stumbling blocks for RTOs in the other three regions of the count ry as they proceed with their own consolidation efforts Moving forward I will attempt to shed some light on the difficult substan tive issues surrounding the Northeast RTO in the words of the FERC admini strative law judge As negotiations continue in this area various stakeho lders have been involved in the discourse including energy companies fina ncial investors and companies that seek to be involved in the management of the transmission assets in the area namely National Grid As noted gov ernance of the Northeast RTO board is the thorniest issue of all again i n the words of Judge Peter Young There has been little doubt that FERC has routinely praised the model used by the PJM system and in fact clearly sta ted in its order that the New England and New York ISOs should adopt the PJ M model Now however new FERC Chairman Pat Wood has acknowledged that the commission may have been in error to express such strong support for only one model out of three Nevertheless FERC already has rejected the request s of the New England and New York ISOs to maintain their status as freesta nding entities For instance on the issue of how the RTO will be governed the New England ISO reportedly believes that all three regions should be equally represent ed to ensure that the unique needs of each are given fair consideration In other words the New England ISO has expressed concerns which are reporte dly shared by the New York ISO as well that all three of the Northeasts m ajor grid operators may not get equal billing in a future board of director s tapped to run the new network One concession made along these lines is t hat FERC has allowed the New England ISO to continue developing the Standar d Market Design or SMD for New England The SMD based on the PJM Interco nnections market design and rules will provide critical market improvemen ts in advance of the single Northeast market The leader of the New York ISO echoed these concerns and reportedly stated that any missteps in the formation of the single Northeast RTO could make Californias energy woes look almost insignificant by comparison Further William Museler the New York ISOs CEO pointed out that the New York ISO represents the largest electricity market of the three by far posting a m arket value for of billion compared to billion for PJM and billion for ISO New England However Museler acknowledges that the Ne w England ISO and PJM have unique areas in which they lead the Northeast re gion For example PJM leads the region in total load served and ISO New En gland leads the region in the number of states represented The other issue that is complicating the formation of a single Northeast RT O is of a structural nature Specifically complex software is needed to se t up a single entity in the region and in other regions that are presently attempting to conjoin various entities In fact the selection and instal lation of this software may actually delay the formation of the Northeast R TO until the fourth quarter of according to Judge Young In addition Young reportedly said the software and technology needed to set up an RTO to keep electricity smoothly moving throughout the Northeast will rank seco nd only to that used by the banking industry While much of the debate surrounding the formation of a single RTO in the N ortheast may seem like policy minutia it does have a very critical impact on realworld operations in the region The problem may be particularly acu te in New England a region where deficiencies in the transmission system h ave already begun to cause reliability problems As Ive discussed in previ ous columns see the IssueAlert available at wwwscientechcom rci for more information New England has maintained an adequate supply of power generation but is suffering from a strained transmission system The sixstate region of New England covers about miles of highvoltage t ransmission lines As a whole the region is capable of generating about MW of electricity and during the heat wave of the last few weeks cons umption peaked at MW creating an extremely tight situation for util ities such as NStar Leaders at the New England ISO for instance have acknowledged that transm ission constraints in the region have caused inefficient operation Without necessary upgrades to the system they say electricity transmission to ar eas of short supply could add million to million per year to the price of delivering power through the region from through Power outages that occurred in the Boston area this summer highlighted fundamenta l deficiencies in the regions transmission and distribution systems the i mprovements for which are dependent on large sums of capital investment and a conducive political environment The bottom line may be that without a comprehensive and functioning RTO in the region investments to upgrade the transmission system in the area may be delayed exposing the region to fur ther reliability problems Moreover the challenges associated with forming one RTO in the Northeast m ay support the argument against consolidating RTOs which comes mostly from the existing transmission entities and utility owners who argue that milli ons of dollars in startup costs and infrastructure investment will be lost if their independent systems are nullified In addition these entities ha ve a real problem with losing their current autonomy and independent contro l over their own transmission systems Thus the FERC order regarding conso lidation will continue to be challenged and its implementation may be a lon g and involved process An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage

Named Company of the Year By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Duke Energy NYSE DUK was named Energy Compa ny of the Year at the Financial Times Global Energy Awards ceremonies held last week in New York The awards sponsored by publishing and informa tion company Platts and the professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohm atsu recognized Duke Energy for its diversified operations and its success ful overall growth during the past year Analysis may turn out to be the most tumultuous year in the history o f the energy industry and certainly the most volatile since deregulation b egan about four years ago However in the course of a year that has witnes sed the bankruptcy filings of two leading energy companies Pacific Gas E lectric Co and Enron Duke Energys success during the same time frame is all the more impressive In addition to earnings that consistently meet or exceed expectations Duke has carved out a unique niche in the energy merc hant space the same market in which its competitor Enron has now failed T he pending acquisition of Vancouverbased Westcoast Energy should also add to Dukes alreadydiverse portfolio give it a lock on Canadas seemingly a bundant gas reserve fields and expand the companys North American pipelin e capacity However in my estimation the real significance of Dukes perf ormance is the strategy that is working behind the scenes at this company While more energy companies continue to announce massive restructuring plan sdividing up their regulated and unregulated businessesDuke remains intac t Further while other companies become more focused on a primary fuel sou rce natural gas coal or nuclear Duke remains broadly diversified What this means is that once again Duke Energy is bucking trends and doing thi ngs its own way Instead of following a growing trend of becoming a purepl ay company Duke continues to play its card as a multifocused operation w hich it claims may be its secret weapon in a volatile market First and foremost Dukes stats remain very impressive in a market terrain that has become rather bleak The company has consistently maintained a ma rket capitalization of billion a book value of and PE ratio of In addition while Enrons stock has languished below the mark Duke shares are currently priced at as of early morning trading o n Dec and recorded a week high of For the third quarter Duke reported a percent increase in ongoing earnings per share or per share Yeartodate earnings per share from ongoing operations as of Sept were compared to for the same period last year For yearend Duke remains committed to delivering earnings growth within a stated guidance of to percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of in Looking ahead to Duke Energy expects to earn toward the high end of the to percent range In addition Duke presently owns and operates nearly MW of generatio n worldwide putting it on par with or very close to other generating compa nies such as AEP and Exelon and reportedly trades eight times as much pow er and five to six times as much natural gas as it owns operates or contro ls Duke also claims that it transports percent of the natural gas consum ed in the United States as a whole and percent of the natural gas consu med on the East Coast Also Duke has some miles of naturalgas pipe line in operation miles under construction and miles in developmen t Responding to the newly bestowed award Dukes CEO Richard Priory said Th is award recognizes the business strategy of Duke Energy which has remaine d focused on creating customer and shareholder value during a turbulent yea r in the energy sector This statement is significant because perhaps mor e than Dukes strong numbers the companys business strategy is arguably w hat gained it the enviable designation as company of the year According to Priory Duke is attributing its financial success and strong projections for the future to its diverse portfolio and decision to remain an integrat ed company In other words all of Duke Energys various business operation sincluding ownership of naturalgas and power assets storage and transpor tation positions and financial and physical tradingall stand as business units under the parent organization Duke apparently has no plans to spin o ff any of its highgrowth operations into a standalone operation In fact Priory maintains that combining our slate of power generation and gaspip eline assets with trading capabilities and structured origination allows us to prosper through the ups and downs of market cycles Priory previously expressed that Duke is positioned to sustain its growth trajectory by leveraging the volatility that so many other companies fear It is becoming more and more uncommon for a company to remain as broadly diversified as Duke Energy with regard to owning naturalgas pipelines an d generation assets and operating an active trading strategy Indeed Wall Street presently seems particularly skittish about energy companies that ha ve their fingers in various business sectors and seems to prefer companies that become more focused on one operation in which they can excel When re ferring to the pureplay strategy Priory has previously alluded to compani es that focus exclusively on generation or trading and how he believes tha t approach carries a higher risk proposition than Dukes more diversified s trategy The other trend that is so common with energy companies right now is corpor ate restructuring to split off regulated and unregulated units in an attemp t to realize greater value for both The list of companies following this s trategy is becoming longer all the time but already AEP Reliant Southern Company UtiliCorp and Xcel have announced or completed massive endeavo rs to construct an operational wall between their regulated and unregulated businesses In some cases this has led to spinning off the unregulated bu siness into its own standalone company On the opposite end of the spectrum Duke remains a holding company with va rious business units all integrated into one business model As of spring Duke had structured its operations into seven business segments North American Wholesale Energy including the companys merchant generatio n portfolio International Energy comprised of Duke Energy International with business es in the Asia Pacific Latin America and European regions Field Services including the companys naturalgas midstream gathering an d production businesses Natural Gas Transmission comprised of the companys naturalgas storage an d pipeline businesses Franchised Electric Duke Power the electric utility serving two million c ustomers in North Carolina and South Carolina and Duke Electric Transmissi on Duke Ventures including Crescent Resources a real estate operation DukeN et Communications a telecom outfit and Duke Capital Partners which is es sentially an investment banking firm and Other Energy Services including DukeSolutions a CI commercial energy ser vices unit Duke Engineering Services an energy engineering and technica l services unit and Duke Fluor Daniel which is involved in power plant engineering and construction It should be noted that at least until the Enron debacle there have been downsides to this approach First investors may continue to be less likely to support a fully integrated operation that is broadly diversified prefe rring instead to invest in companies that are more clearly focused As note d investors generally now support pureplay strategies and may seek out en ergy companies that have a very narrow and targeted business model Second on a related note in an integrated company the success or failure of one business unit will have a direct impact on all of the other units Without separating its operations Duke could face a situation in which struggles i n one particular area telecom for instance could impinge on earnings in an unrelated but connected business unit The bottom line for Duke may be that these potential risks pale in comparison to the advantage that the co mpany believes it has over competitors in keeping its diverse operations in tegrated As a final note it is important to establish the role that Dukes bil lion pending acquisition of Westcoast Energy most likely will play in its c ontinued success and its role in the reasoning for Duke being anointed as company of the year From my perspective one of the most important aspects of Dukes purchase of Westcoast Energy is the control over naturalgas pip elines that Duke gains in the deal Upon completion of the deal the combin ed entity reportedly will have miles of gathering pipeline gasp rocessing facilities miles of gas transmission and miles of distribution pipeline The purchase of Westcoast Energy which includes a substantial amount of energy infrastructure in Canada should help Duke to supply fuel to its current power plants in the United States and

escientechcomIATESTCornerBRjpg December Reliant Energy Proceeds with Corporate Restructuring Bucking Turnaround of Industry Trend By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PRNewswire Reliant Energy NYSE REI shareholders approve d on Dec a major step in a corporate restructuring that will ultimately divide the company into a regulated energydelivery company named CenterPo int Energy and a competitive energy services provider called Reliant Resour ces Analysis It is somewhat surprising that Reliant Energy is proceeding with its massive restructuring which it acknowledges is being done to maximize shareholder value considering how dramatically the market has changed sinc e the company first announced its plans about months ago In July Reliants plans to bifurcate its operations were just the latest in a strin g of similar restructuring initiatives from companies such as Southern Co and Xcel Energy both of which spun off highgrowth unregulated subsidiari es into standalone companies in very successful IPOs Fast forward a year later and the splitting of regulated operations from unregulated operations into two standalone companies no longer appears to be a surefire busines s decision For example companies such as Constellation Energy and Alleghe ny Energy which announced plans to engage in this kind of restructuring ac tivity after Reliants announcements now have backpedaled and put such pla ns on hold The details among the companies may be different but the end r esult is pretty much the same splintering an integrated company into two o perations to attract two sets of investors At the onset of the plans the real appeal was to put unregulated power generation into a separately trade d company and sell lots of stock That sounded like a great idea last year when the independent power producer IPP market was going gangbusters Now demand and prices have dropped and the merchant energy industry is shrou ded in uncertainty Into these rocky waters Reliant Energy is about the on ly company that still believes a major restructuring is presently a wise mo ve As noted Reliants restructuring plans have been in motion for over a year so in fairness to the company it may be making the decision to proceed w ith the risky initiative in hopes that investors will still be receptive T he IPO of subsidiary Reliant Resources held in May raised about billion and was considered one of the most successful offerings this year Reliant Energy presently owns a little more than percent of Reliant Re sources whose business model is focused primarily on wholesale power marke ting maintaining generating and trading assets and selling retail energy Quite naturally Reliant is hoping for a repeat of that success when the s pinoff is completed in the first quarter of Lets be clear about what Reliant is doing with this restructuring plan Wh at shareholders approved this week was the formation of a new holding compa ny called CenterPoint Energy which will include both the companys regulat ed energydelivery business and Reliant Resources The creation of a new ho lding company and accompanying name change are being characterized as inter im steps that Reliant is taking toward the ultimate separation of the unreg ulated and regulated businesses After receiving regulatory approvals from the IRS and SEC shares of Reliant Energy will be automatically converted i nto shares of CenterPoint Energy which will trade under the symbol CEP on the New York and Chicago Stock Exchanges Trading for Reliant Energy under the symbol REI will be discontinued at that point As the next step in the restructuring pending an additional round of regul atory approvals CenterPoint Energy will spin off the regulated company by distributing its shares of Reliant Resources to its shareholders creating two separately owned public companies Ultimately CenterPoint Energy will own only the regulated side of the business including electricity transmis sion and distribution naturalgas distribution pipelines and any power g eneration facilities that remain regulated Reliants motivations to divide itself into two companies are pretty straig htforward On one hand the company is simply complying with the regulatory mandates of Texas which require that state utilities establish firewalls between their operating companies and create separate businesses for genera tion energy services distribution etc Yet more importantly Reliant is turning the mandate into a potential financial opportunity by establishing two public companies with dramatically different risk reward profiles T he unregulated side will include such businesses as power generation marke ting and trading and the European operations The regulated side will incl ude the businesses related to electricity and naturalgas distribution as w ell as the companys US interstate pipelines Note that the company previ ously indicated plans to sell its communications unit which has struggled amid a larger market downturn in this sector Thus once the restructuring is completed CenterPoint will be aimed at the traditional type of utility investor which expects steady returns and reliable dividend income while Reliant Resources will be more geared toward investors with a high toleranc e for risk that want to take advantage of competitive opportunities in the deregulating wholesale market Reliant Energys CEO Steve Letbetter recently said he expects CenterPoints dividend payout to be comparable to other regulated utilities suggesting a payout greater than percent of earnings per share The company had alr eady projected that CenterPoints earnings per share for will fall in the range of to As I mentioned however economic conditions in the energy industry have ch anged considerably since Reliant announced its restructuring plans over a y ear ago and the new industry climate may make the companys decisions to p roceed with its plans a risky move Again I will point to the examples of Constellation and Allegheny which really seemed to be caught in the crossf ire of the restructuring trend and are still sorting through residual fallo ut At the time of their original restructuring announcements both Constel lation and Allegheny had grounds to be fairly confident of their plans con sidering how high the valuations for independent generating companies were running at that time Yet in a fastchanging market those valuations have dropped considerably and the shares of both companies received some major hits related to this d ecline Constellation shares were trading at about in May but pre sently are priced at half that figure Allegheny is down about percent f rom its high of a share to While the drop in share price that thes e two companies have faced cannot be totally attributed to their restructur ing plans the important point is that companies that planned to restructur e have done so to put more emphasis on their unregulated trading operations a sector that has been undervalued This point can be supported by lookin g at companies that have completed their restructuring processes such as N RG Energy and Mirant which are trading at to percent below their week highs Clearly investor confidence in such companies has been eroded By the same token shares of Reliant Energy are trading at about dow n from a week high of while shares of Reliant Resources are trading at about down from a high of This could be related to investo rs concerns about the companys plans to proceed with restructuring in the current market climate Moreover a year ago the concept of utility restructuring to separate regul ated operations from unregulated businesses seemed like a quick way for com panies to cash in on the opportunities created by deregulated energy market s In fact it was the expectation of companies involved in the restructuri ng to gain a plus PE ratio for the unregulated company once it had been split off from the regulated business However the actual process of rest ructuring which can take a year or more is taking place under lessthanc onducive market conditions including a drop in energy prices reduced dema nd and warnings of an energy glut The original purpose of the restructurin g plans that is to give shareholders increased value is no longer a guar anteed result for companies that proceed with the separation plan as Const ellation and Allegheny clearly found Only time will tell if Reliants comp leted restructuring plan will prove to be another success or another failur e in the energy industry but it is a fairly safe bet that Reliant is one o f the last companies that will be riding the restructuring trend any time s oon Ironically one company that routinely has been praised for its strategy th is year is Duke Energy NYSE DUK which made a pointed decision to ignore the restructuring trend and remain an integrated company In addition to r ecently being named Energy Company of the Year at the Financial Times Global Energy Awards Dukes financials remain quite strong For the third quarter Duke reported a percent increase in ongoing earnings per s hare or per share Yeartodate earnings per share from ongoing oper ations as of Sept were compared to for the same period last year For yearend Duke remains committed to delivering earnings gro wth within a stated guidance of to percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of in Looking ahead to Du ke expects to earn toward the high end of the to percent range When asked to establish reasons for the companys success Duke Energy CEO Rich ard Priory mentioned the decision to remain an integrated company against a trend of other companies splintering apart Other Reliant Resources News Shareholders of Orion Power Holdings NYSE ORN overwhelmingly approved th e merger agreement between Orion and Reliant Resources which was announced last September Under the agreement Reliant is buying Orion for pe r share in a cash transaction valued at approximately billion Reliant Resources will also assume approximately billion of Orion Powers net debt The companies anticipate that the transaction will be completed in e arly at which time Orion Powers business will be combined with Relia nt Resources domestic wholesale group When previously discussing this acquisition please see the IssueAl ert available at wwwscientechcom rci I es tablished five reasons why Reliant is buying Orion which also support the assessment that it is a strategic purchase These reasons are as follows Reliant Resources gains Orions generating assets which support its own expanding wholesale business Orions assets are primarily located in th e Northeast particularly in New York which unlike Reliants core territo ry offers a fully functional deregulated wholesale market Facing econo mic downturns and the possible softening of demand Reliant Resources acqu isition of Orion is expected to immediately keep earnings solid while othe r competitors are lowering their own earnings expectations The purchase illustrates the spate of consolidation efforts that are taking place in th e independent power producing market and The purchase supports Reliant Resources intentions to focus exclusively on North America and divest its European assets Testimonials Thanks for your material It

Transformation Into Touch America By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from CBS MarketWatch Montana Power shares fell on Nov a da y after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter citing the slowdow n in the economy and the companys transition from a diversified energy com pany to a standalone telecommunications firm The stock fell to a week low of earlier in the session It closed Nov at down ce nts As of early morning trading on Nov Montana Power shares remained at Analysis There is little doubt that Montana Power currently finds itself a t a challenging crossroads The company remains in the midst of becoming so lely a telecommunications operation having sold off much of its utility ho ldings However the process has hit several snags including an incomplete transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to Northwestern Corp C ompounding Montana Powers current problems is a weakened financial perform ance which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the telecom business In addition the company faces a host of related challen ges including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for t he asset sale to Northwestern requests for rate increases to fund the purc hase of power that Montana Power must buy on the wholesale market and insp ection of the longterm powerpurchase contracts that the company has forme d with various suppliers The question that investors should be asking with regard to Montana Powers current plight is whether or not the financial l osses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or so me larger indication of doubt about the companys viability as a telecom op eration For its third quarter Montana Power posted a loss of million o r cents a share representing a million swing from its Q pro fit of million or cents a share During the third quarter of Montana Power had reported a net income of million Montana Power h as noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to Touch America but also included a million pretax writedown of inve stments in two other telecommunications companies One had filed for bankru ptcy and the other defaulted on loans that Montana Power had helped guarant ee In addition company officials have attributed the loss to price decrea ses and the slowing economy However note that the current thirdquarter l osses followed losses in the second quarter as well Specifically the comp any reported a net loss of million or cents a share in the Q compared with net income of million or cents a share in the second quarter of The company also previously reduced its expectation s of revenue growth in to percent from percent According to Mon tana Powers CEO Bob Gannon the company is merely experiencing a shortte rm liquidity problem Nevertheless to say that Montana Power is having some growing pains is an understatement Since March it has been Montana Powers goal to total ly divest all of its energy assets and reemerge as a debtfree communicati ons company operating under the name of Touch America presently the compa nys telecom subsidiary with zero debt million in cash and m iles of fiber communications lines CEO Gannon originally envisioned and c ontinues to see Touch America as one of the largest broadband companies in the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrat ed Montana Power Much of the transition has already taken place consideri ng that Montana Power has successfully divested its oil and gas coal and i ndependent power production businesses As noted the last piece of the puz zle is the sale of its electric and naturalgas utility operations to North western Corp a provider of electricity naturalgas and communications se rvices to Midwestern customers This is a big piece of the puzzle however as Touch America is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to sup port continued growth Therein lies one of the main challenges for Montana Power The Montana Publ ic Service Commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve t he sale of these assets Some analysts have suggested that Montana Powers financial problems can be resolved only if the Montana Public Service Commi ssion approves the sale of the electric and naturalgas distribution system s which could inject some million in Touch Americas operations Yet state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsels office wh ich represents ratepayers in utility cases and a group of large industrial electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed sale of the assets The less time provided for equalopportunity review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be cha llenged down the line After some early deliberation the Montana Public Service Commission has no w agreed to review the billion proposed sale of the assets to Northwes tern Corp by Jan although lawyers for Montana Power are still l obbying to have this review moved up to December Part of the pressure for the review the companys attorneys have argued is that if the sale is not approved by the end of the year investors and lenders may lose patience r egarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capi tal support into the growing Touch America Furthermore the viability of t he entire business plan for Touch America could be brought into question if this asset sale is not approved by state regulators considering that Mont ana Power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the ne w telecom company The sales agreement between Montana Power and Northweste rn Corp expires March so time is also a factor Another issue that has yet to be resolved is Montana Powers intent to rais e rates to support purchases of wholesale power In other words as a tange ntial issue related to the sale of its assets state regulators also questi on how Montana Power will recover certain powersupply costs as it continue s to morph into a telecom business The company has established that it exp ects to pay nearly billion over the next years for wholesale power pu rchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company from a utility holding company and hopes to increase electric rates by percent to support these expenses Montana Power is still considered the de fault provider to about customers and needs an average of MW f or its customers However the company also needs to keep a total of MW as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep MW of reser ve power Since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to PPL Corp it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by the Montana Public Service Commission The percent rate increase reporte dly would increase residential electricity rates by about a month sta rting in July making the average bill about per month In additio n to the projected percent increase for residential customers Montana P ower estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by p ercent and medium industrial customers could see a percent increase It is important to note that a recent survey by the Great Falls Tribune conclu ded that the increase in Montana Powers rates would produce some of the h ighest residential electric rates in the Northwest Montana Power is attempting to establish longterm power contracts with sup pliers to meet its entire load requirements For instance Montana Power fo rmed a buyback agreement with PPL as a condition of the generation sale tw o years ago This contract expires July Beyond that date Montana Power announced that it signed a oneyear contract to buy MW from Duke Energy at an undisclosed price PPL also has formed a new contract to provi de MW to Montana Power over a fiveyear period after its current contra ct expires Northwestern Power the purchaser of Montana Powers distributi on system has said that it wants Montana Power to assemble a diverse packa ge of powerpurchase deals instead of buying all its load from one source to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region Mont ana Power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of powerpurchase deals to t he Montana Public Service Commission to determine the inclusion of those de als within the rate structure and the portfolio contains about threefourt hs of the MW that Montana Power will need to cover its peak demand of customers and maintain an adequate reserve The company will probably purc hase the balance of its requirements on the shortterm market Also on the legal front Montana Power continues to navigate through at le ast two litigious proceedings First in August a group of Montana Power s hareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility claiming the companys effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them billion in lost stock value The complaint filed in the District Court at Butte said the sale of Montana Power generation plants to PPL Montana in December was done without the required shareholder approval and should be overturned The suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and an estimated million in profits realized by PPL from operating the pl ants into a trust until the case is resolved What this means is that the s ale of Montana Powers generation assets are in a state of litigation even though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago Anot her lawsuit is related to Montana Powers million purchase last year o f Qwest Communications longdistance and other telephone businesses within a state service area Essentially Montana Power has launched a suit ag ainst Qwest alleging that Qwest has violated antitrust laws and constrain ed competition in the longdistance and voice and data market Consequently as Montana Power closes out the year and hits the twoyear ma rk in its transformation into Touch America the future for the company loo ks rather questionable Although there are market doubts about the future o f the telecom sector Montana Power remains confident that its longterm pr ospects as a telecom company remain very strong Nevertheless the current question for investors is how quickly and how successfully Montana can comp lete its transformation into Touch America In other words what Montana Po wer sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached The path to the compa nys final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal o bstacles An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look forward to hearing from you Nancy

Intelligence rciwsimagesjbrockphotojpg News item from PR Newswire Enron Corp NYSE ENE announced today that i t has entered into an agreement with Northwest Natural Gas Company NYSE N WN for the sale of Enrons wholly owned electric utility subsidiary Portl and General Electric The proposed transaction which is subject to customa ry regulatory approvals is expected to close by the fourth quarter of Analysis Enron is attempting to sell Portland General again this time to Northwest Natural Gas Company NW Natural Enron attempted to sell Portlan d General to Sierra Pacific in November of However that sale did not complete apparently due to a delay in Nevada deregulation Lets take a st ep back and look at the history of Enrons dance with Portland General Enron originally confirmed that its merger with Portland General had clos ed effective July approximately one year after it was announced T he billion combination created an enterprise with a market value of appr oximately billion Enron issued million new common shares to share holders of Portland General consolidated Portland Generals debt of b illion and accounted for the transaction on a purchase accounting basis The acquisition linked Enron and Portland General a successful lowcost e lectric utility operating in the fastgrowing Pacific Northwest region Wit h ownership of approximately megawatts of generating capacity and mor e than miles of naturalgas pipeline worldwide in the combined company aimed to provide integrated energy solutions for wholesale and ret ail natural gas and electricity customers in North America and internationa lly At least that was the plan Enron also did an acquisition of a telecommunications firm based in Portlan d Ore that had links to Portland General On Nov Enron announc ed the acquisition of OPTEC Inc a Portland Orebased provider of data c ommunications integration and services The acquisition was handled through FirstPoint Enrons telecommunications unit at the time It was originally part of Portland General FirstPoint had announced in September an ag reement with the Williams Communications Group unit of The Williams Cos W illiams and Montana Powers Touch America to build a fiber optic network from Portland to Los Angeles For those of us covering the energy industry you will recall that was a period of energy convergence Utilities were expanding into telecommun ications at a headspinning rate and oil and gas companies were busy doing strategic acquisitions Williams had agreed to acquire Mapco Inc for about billion in stock and the assumption of about billion in Mapco debt in November Also announced in the same month was Sonat Inc known for its pipelines agree ing to acquire closely held exploration and production concern Zilkha Energ y Co for billion in stock In June NGC Corp announced that it had closed an acquisition of Destec Energy Inc a leading independent po wer producer and had closed on the related sale of most of Destecs intern ational projects and operations to AES Corp for million subject to c ertain adjustments The net cost of the assets to be retained by NGC origi nally expected to be approximately million had been estimated to be i n the range of to million after the sale of certain nonstrategi c assets Also occurring in June of was Duke Power Co and Houstonbas ed PanEnergy Corp linking up in a merger that took approximately seven m onths to complete Under terms of the agreement shares of PanEnergy stock would be converted to shares of Duke Energy stock Duke Energy would adopt Duke Powers present common stock dividend payment of per shar e So Enron was not alone in the mergermania field of energy companies expa nding their balance sheet with strategic assets Two years later however E nron decided to exit Portland General Enron had decided to sell Portland G eneral to Sierra Pacific With the announced sale Kenneth Lay Enron Corp chairman and CEO said The rapidly evolving competitive electricity marke t allows us to deliver commodity services and risk management products to o ur customers without requiring the ownership of a regulated electric utilit y Jeff Skilling then Enrons president and COO also chimed in by saying In general we would say that Portland General is not as strategic as it was beforewhen it had a strong wholesale business that we could integrate with our nationwide wholesale business In the two years following the billion purchase of Portland General Enr on found operating a strictly regulated electric utility to be frustrating Oregon regulators approved the acquisition only after Enron agreed to cut power rates by million more than double what the company had proposed Oregon regulators also rejected plans to sell Portland Generals power plantsplaying havoc with Enrons asset management strategy Nevadabased Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy Portland General in Nov ember It was to pay billion including billion in cash It also was to assume about billion in debt and preferred stock The deal was officially called off in April of this year although it had been consid ered dead months before Sierra Pacific planned to sell some of its Nevada assets to raise cash for the deal but Nevadas move to electricity deregul ation was delayed and Sierra couldnt carry out the sales Enron begins to look for another buyer and has found Northwest Natural Gas Company According to Enron under terms of the agreement Northwest will p urchase Portland General from Enron for billion This is comprised o f billion in cash million in Northwest preferred stock mil lion in Northwest common stock and the assumption of Enrons million b alance on its customer benefits obligation which was stipulated in its agreement to purchase Portland General In addition to the purchase price Northwest will assume approximately billion in Portland General debt and preferred stock According to Moodys this morning Northwest plans to form a holding compan y HoldCo that will become the parent of Northwest Natural and Portland Ge neral HoldCo plans to finance this transaction with a combination of about billion of bank borrowings about million of common stock and FE LINE PRIDES a mandatory convertible hybrid security to be sold to Enron and about million of common stock to be sold to the public Consummati on of this transaction is contingent upon numerous regulatory approvals wh ich are expected to take from nine to twelve months Northwest principally is engaged in the distribution of natural gas The Or egon Public Utility Commission has allocated to Northwest as its exclusive service area a major portion of western Oregon including the Portland me tropolitan area most of the Willamette Valley and the coastal area from As toria to Coos Bay Northwest also holds certificates from the Washington Ut ilities and Transportation Commission granting it exclusive rights to serve portions of three Washington counties bordering the Columbia River Gas se rvice is provided in cities together with neighboring communities in Oregon counties and in nine cities together with neighboring communitie s in three Washington counties They serve more than customers in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington Portland General currently serve s customers and owns megawatts of electric generation split evenly between hydro coal and natural gas So is energy convergence over Absolutely not Northwest is obviously movin g into power with this purchase of Portland General from Enron And it is a good move for them They are obviously the local favorite have an establi shed network in the states of Oregon and Washington and already have commo dity delivery experience in the naturalgas arena As far as I can tell th ere are no strings attached to deregulation of Oregon in order for this

Age By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence rciwsimagesjbrockphotojpg News item from Reuters Big Oil must prepare itself for the end of the hyd rocarbon age as alternative energies win over consumers in coming decades chairman of the worlds No energy firm Royal DutchShell said on Wednesd ay Oil giants from the last century will have to look to their laurels if they are not to be unseated as motorists move toward hydrogenpowered vehic les and renewable energies such as wind or solar power emerge Shell Chair man Phil Watts told reporters Analysis It seems that Big Oil is beginning to look at scenarios that ha ve alternative energy sources to oil and gas At least two of the three Bi gs are prominently playing alternatives into their longrange planning Br itish Petroleum BP has an aggressive campaign on alternative energy sourc es while others like Exxon have continued to be focused solely on oil and gas Wednesday in New York Watts spoke to reporters about Shells scenario plan ning This longrange outlook of world energy has oil shrinking from per cent of the worlds energy source to percent by Oil will still be the leader with gas coming in at percent in However it is still quite a drop From Oil to Gas One thing I am convinced of is that the next years is not going to be m ore of the same An energy company had better make sure it has the necessar y expertise and knowledge Watts said at the launch of Shells Long Term Energy Scenarios Referring to one of Shells scenarios Watts said We c ould see an evolutionary progression the socalled carbon shift from coal to gas to renewables or possibly even to nuclear One could argue that the US is already seeing the shift from coal to gas The Energy Information Administration EIA has estimated that at the fore casted rate of electricity consumption new power plants will be need ed over the next years The majority of these plants are fueled by natur al gas According to the energy profile of the US released by the EIA in April of this year the US has proven naturalgas reserves of trillio n cubic feet Tcf percent of world reserves and currently consumes n atural gas at a rate of Tcf per year From a longterm perspective ho wever natural gas is very limited in supply In the United States the rem aining natural gas resource is expected to be near depletion within year s Coal is clearly the nations greatest resource representing approximate ly percent of our fossil energy reserves Calpine is certainly capitalizing on the nearterm future of natural gasfi red generation They announced a purchase of FB and FA gasfired tu rbines from General Electric in April of this year and Siemens Westingho use steam turbines just last month The purchase announcements are a part o f Calpines fiveyear strategic plan to have megawatts of generation online by the end of The US imports only net Tcf of natural gas largely from Canada Na turalgas wellhead prices averaged over per thousand cubic feet mcf during the first quarter of up sharply from mcf seen in a nd nearly triple the average price of mcf The price increases a re attributed to a decline in US gas production during the s because of low prices the increase in demand driven by new power generation and g as storage levels dropping below normal Recently gas prices returned to t he mcf level after a mild summer but NYMEX futures contracts for late deliveries are trading above the mcf level indicating the expectatio n that gas prices will rise in response to the anticipated increased demand Canadian imports are also expected to expand substantially through res ulting from additional gasfired electric power plants This anticipated in creased consumption requires expansion of gas pipeline and storage capacity trillion over the next years according to the National Petroleum C ouncil Duke Energy certainly has recognized this trend and has capitalized quickly by announcing the purchase of Westcoast Energy Inc a Canadianb ased utility engaged primarily in naturalgas gathering processing transm ission storage and distribution as well as electric power generation in ternational financial information technology and energy services busines ses From Gas to Renewables According to one of Shells scenarios at some point we will move from gas to renewables Shell lists those options as solar and wind energy and has b acked up its claim with a million to billion spending package over the next five years focused primarily onyou guessed itsolar and wind If a large oil company announced that it had up to billion to invest in so lar and wind who would begin to show up on the radar screen Lets take a quick look at a few likely candidates AstroPower Inc Wyoming Road Solar Park Newark DE wwwastropowercom Technology Photovoltaics Start date AstroPower produces a complete line of photovoltaic solar cells solar modu les and complete systems packages for residential commercial and industria l applications as well as turnkey power plant solutions for utilities in th e newly deregulated energy market They originally received a million investment from the Department of Energy DOE and have since IPOd and can be found

They claim to have seen an i ncrease in home wind energy systems as a result of the California energy cr isis Worthy of noting here is the fact that Shell competitor BP has already ente red into the renewable arena and has recently formed a new division known a s BP Solar Based in Linthicum Md they produce highefficiency silicon c ells and modules customdesigned batteries power control electronics and where appropriate load equipment in the solar industry Fueling Shells in terest may be some of the recent successes that BP Solar has enjoyed In March of this year BP Solar announced that over residents of th e Philippines would benefit from a deal signed between them and the Spanish and Philippine governments to bring solar power to isolated villages i n the Philippines Led by the Philippine Department of Agrarian Reform DAR the million contractthe largest solar energy project everis financ ed by the Spanish government and will be implemented in two phases the fir st scheduled to begin just last month In April of this year BP Solar announced plans to build a solarmodule ass embly plant in Hamlin Lower Saxony Germany With a total investment in Ha mlin of million the plant will have an annual production capacity of MW and create more than new jobs The Hamlin plant was soon surpassed by the announcement of an Australian fa cility in June Opening in Homebush Bay in Sydney the new plant will manuf acture BPs highefficiency solar panels bringing valuable export dollars to the country with over percent of the panels to be exported around the world BP invested over million to build the plant that is providing o ver high tech jobs The new facility houses all of BP Solars Australia n manufacturing design and market support facilities Cell annual output c apacity will reach MW in and the plant has the capability for possib le further expansion Do Renewables Include Fuel Cells Shell also mentioned multiple scenarios under their longrange planning eff orts one of which included an increase in the fuel cell industry Accordin g to the fuel cell scenario rapid growth in fuel cellswhich produce elect ricity from hydrogen and cut harmful emissionscould shift the energy busin ess dramatically away from oil long before oil becomes scarce Todays fuel cells typically create hydrogen by reforming natural gas so they do not f it the definition of being a renewable resource Rather fuel cells hold gr eat promise to reduce air pollution emissions when compared to combustion t echnologies Fuel cells produce nearzero emissions and highly pure water w hen converting a hydrogenrich source into electric energy I am impressed that two of the three largest oil producers are beginning to look at their mainstay business as being limited in the long run Radical changes that are possible in the energy business means that the industry pa rticipants which dominated the last century such as Exxon BP and Shell can not afford to assume they will dominate for the next years In the word s of Shell Chairman Phil Watts that would be a very complacent view Long evity in corporations is not the norm Chairman Watts reminds me of an exe rcise performed in many business schools around the country today Look at the New York Stock Exchange years ago and try to find companies that ar e still in the mix Surprisingly it is difficult to find many Those tha t are still in existence have had to change dramatically in order to surviv e IBM used to be a typewriter manufacturer Today they are the worlds lar gest computer company Where will the oil companies be

Bellemare Vice President rciwsimagesrbellemarephotojpg News item from Reuters The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Southern California Edison SCE the utility unit of Edison International NYSE EIX said they have reached an agreement that will enable the utility to pay off its creditors and prevent another utility bankruptcy in California The CPUC also rejected the states plan to issue a record billion bond to fund some of Californias power purchases Analysis In a striking move SCE has reached agreement with the CPUC on a plan to keep the company out of bankruptcy SCE accumulated a billion debt buying electricity on the wholesale market at prices far greater than it was allowed to recover under a rate freeze imposed by deregulation The key elements of the plan include a rate freeze and an agreement by SCE to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off SCEs rates were raised by approximately percent earlier this year and will remain frozen through unless its pays off its debts sooner In exchange SCE agreed it will use cash on hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts pay no dividends on its common stock through or until its back debts are fully paid and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power Wall Street was quick to react favorably to the plan as SCEs parent company stock NYSE EIX rallied to its highest level in months Edisons stock rose to close at and shares of Californias largest electric utility Pacific Gas Electric parent PGE Corp NYSE PCG advanced to PGE who chose to declare bankruptcy earlier this year said in a statement Anything that would return utilities to financial health is a positive step in bringing stability to the states yearlong energy crisis However it pointed out that the framework of the settlement appears to be remarkably similar to the rate stabilization plan that it and Edison proposed to the CPUC nearly a year ago The relative ease with which this agreement appears to have been reached in the past few days suggests that the upheaval and damage of the past year might have been avoided Shares in energy merchant firms selling power in the California market also rose sharply Wednesday as investors gained confidence that these firms will now get paid for their prior electricity sales to SCE Gainers included Mirant Corp NYSEMIR which was up percent or to Enron Corp NYSEENE up percent or to and Calpine Corp NYSECPN up percent or to Consumer groups blasted the settlement calling it a bailout that froze SCEs electric prices at artificially high levels Mike Florio senior attorney for the consumer group Utility Reform Network argued that the settlement actually has unhealthy implications for consumers While the state legislature refused to force consumers to pay for the bailout they were considering the CPUC is insisting that small customers bear the brunt of Edisons problems he said noting that consumers will pay inflated rates indefinitely Gov Gray Davis was also supportive of the agreement stating it protected the public interest and will allow the states secondlargest utility to return to financial health adding that he welcomed the CPUCs assurance this could be accomplished without raising electric rates The governor canceled a special Oct legislative session he had called to solve SCEs financial problems The governor however had harsh words concerning an earlier vote by the CPUC that rejected the states bond plan to finance electricity purchases made by the states Department of Water Resources on behalf of utilities Californias bond plan was defeated in a vote driven by concerns that the plan was too costly and would surrender the commissions authority to regulate power prices The agreement would have allowed the states Department of Water Resources to decide the reasonableness of power rates traditionally a CPUC responsibility Commissioner Henry Duque said this would set a dangerous precedent and lead to the dismantling of the CPUC The Department of Water Resources was not meant to be a bloated power bureaucracy and the rate agreement would do this said Commissioner Richard Bilas The state of California must now go back to the drawing board to find a way to sell the record billion bond State Treasurer Phil Angelides said he cannot sell the power bonds until the CPUC takes the actions required to implement the law The CPUCs refusal to take action means there is no schedule for the bond issuance and no plan in effect as of today to repay the states general fund Angelides warned that the state faces a budget deficit of over billion in the fiscal year if the bonds are not sold before July Gov Davis said the vote was an irresponsible act It creates uncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the general fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty The four commissioners voting against the bond plan all favor a bill that was authored by state Senate Leader John Burton a San Francisco Democrat on grounds that it is more flexible and less costly But the bill already passed by the legislature is opposed by Gov Davis who has vowed to veto it when it lands on his desk True to its word Southern California Edison has found a way to avert bankruptcy This is a major milestone in the restoration of Californias power business But challenges remain for the state PGE remains in bankruptcy the state is saddled with a billion debt that it must find a way to finance and wholesale electricity prices continue to lower making the states decision to enter into very longterm contracts for electricity supply very questionable Ironically California began its deregulation efforts on the hopes of lowering electricity costs which at the time were some of the highest in the nation Now the state is locked into even higher prices as SCEs interimrate increases averaging centskWh are permanent for the foreseeable future An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV or Compa nia Anomima Nacional Telefonos facing a billion hostile takeover bid by AES Corp NYSE AES has forced a showdown with the USbased global power company by announcing a share repurchase program The Board of Direct ors of CANTV Venezuelas biggest telecommunications company recommended t hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to perce nt of CANTVs shares at a price of per American Depositary Share ADS or approximately per share Analysts said the CANTV Boards proposal s which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set for Oct clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES Analysis AES expansion in Latin Americas telecommunications market was a lways seen as a risky move and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi g bite out of the companys strategy CANTV which was an appealing takeove r target for AES due to its longstanding monopoly over the telecom market in Venezuela has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications NYSE VZ which holds a percent stake in the company Verizon came out in support of the percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV whic h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES efforts to gain c ontrol over the company The repurchase could be seen as a power play with Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV which many analysts m ight see as a more appropriate synergy However this story also highlights the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ a especially since CANTVs resistance comes on the heels of AES pulling o ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador For background it is important to note that AES already owns percent o f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas Venezuel as largest private electricity company Thus the takeover effort is an at tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from Verizon CANTV which was privatized a decade ago is a fullservice teleco mmunications provider offering switched and local domestic and internation al longdistance service throughout Venezuela Company CANTV also offers mo bile cellular services wireless services Internet access and other value added services and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nationa l network of public telephone lines CANTV became privatized about years ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixedline teleph one service in Venezuela The company has a market capitalization of b illion AES had bid in cash for each of the million USlisted shares in CANTV and in cash for each of the million shares of CANTV traded in Venezuela AES offer for CANTVs American shares represents a perc ent premium over CANTVs closing price of on Aug the time at wh ich the takeover effort was launched From the start of the offer some cri tics charged that this bid was too low but AES has maintained that the off er is fair AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTVs mobile services which account for about a quarter of the companys revenues and distribute the proceeds to shareholders CANTV was never very receptive to AES bid and did consider it to be a hos tile takeover In fact workers representatives at CANTV circulated a stat ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES stating that the deal would s everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers CANTV employees hold a per cent interest in the company Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock Note that CANTV wil l most likely issue the buyback program at compared to the that AE S had offered Thus the challenge for AES if it still wants to gain contr ol over CANTV will be to increase its already percent premium offer T he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi th its takeover attempt and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem pts AES rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw ofold in nature First AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil Chile and other countries Just this week AES announced its penetration of the A rgentina market by inking a million deal to purchase distribution and generation assets in that country from New Jerseybased Public Service Ente rprise Group PSEG In another recent announcement AES launched a cash te nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile a company that c onsists of MW of generation and kilometers of transmission In fa ct AES reportedly rivals Spains Endesa as the regions most dominant powe r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t hroughout Latin America Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni ted States Asia Europe and Latin America many investors now perceive th e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America which constitute s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou s Latin American countries However AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a million ta keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor Currently Edelnor which is one of the largest electrical generators in Chile is controlled by Mirant Corp one of AES direct competitors in the independent power producing market Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region Mirant has announc ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles s it can be assured of repayment AES did not give a reason for its decisio n to terminate the Edelnor takeover but one can surmise that investor reac tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor Further on Sept AES cut its earnings estimate for to a range of to per share from a previous range of to AES blam ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and US dollar lower UK power prices and the companys inability to replace earnings a nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant The drop in AES earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp any needed to purchase Edelnor AES shares were priced at prior to the earnings revision After the announcement at least as of early morning trading on Sept AES shares were priced at significantly down from the week high of whi ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago As of early morning trading on Oct AES shares were priced at Moreover investors did not react positively to AES plan to increase its s take in CANTV In fact after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug a day on which many stocks fell AES stock closed down or pe rcent to a month low of on the New York Stock Exchange AES CEO Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase did not represent a change of strategy for AES which he says will remain f ocused on power In addition Bakke noted that the purchase does not repres ent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Br azil and Bolivia Further Bakke clearly stated that AES is not going to a nnounce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world Nevertheless so me investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sec tor which is already significantly troubled and becoming too heavily entr enched in Latin America a market that is prone to political volatility On e investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date has not been terribly successful This coupled with the general market dow nturn for most companies with telecom exposure does not make for a good re cipe from an investors perspective at least as of today In fairness to AES penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver y strategic move from a longterm perspective With a population of mi llion Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r elated services In addition Venezuela is an assetrich country particula rly with regard to oil resources According to the Department of Energy Ve nezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil re serves of billion barrels plus billions of barrels of extraheavy oil a nd bitumen Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of US o il imports and is among the top crude oil producers in the world In add ition as noted AES investments in Latin America are not exclusively focus ed on Venezuela as the company also is present in Argentina Brazil Chile etc Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Lati n America and play a larger role in the drop in AES stock especially when we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time Only little more than a year ago the telecom sector was at its peak with bill ions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic ex pectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market Howeve r a massive downturn has ensued impacting not only companies operating in the telecom space but the nations entire economy as well The bottom of t he telecom sector has fallen out due in large part to the fact that the in crease in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand As Ive said before when analyzing this company the further that AES depar ts from its core strategy the more likely it is that we will continue to s ee volatility in the companys stock Up until these recent announcements AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses which were all equally important to its strategy power generation network delivery services and retail energy marketing Generation always appeared to be the main core of the companys business model as AES controls some facilit ies totaling over gigawatts of capacity worldwide This business model w orked well for AES and was well received by investors Any perceived deviat ion from this successful strategyespecially if it includes expansion into the dangerous territory of telecomcould mark a new and risky era for AES Nevertheless one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunit y that is worth exploring Latin America has low electrification and Intern et usage statistics Some analysts project high growth in the next to years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use which in t urn involves telecommunications The telecom industry is struggling at the moment Thus if one believes that telecom will make a comeback then buyin g now may make a wise strategy for those involved An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from PR Newswire Mirant Corp NYSE MIR announced on Oct that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Ca lgarybased TransCanada Pipelines Limited a move that would make the compa ny the largest naturalgas marketer in Canada the largest naturalgas expo rter to the United States and the numbertwo gas marketer in North America Terms of the purchase were not disclosed although it is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year pending approvals from regulators pro ducers and customers Analysis Its nothing short of amazing the number of naturalgas transacti ons that have taken place between US integrated energy firms and Canadian gas companies in alone As is often the case what seemed like a tren d now appears to be an industry standard as those US power firms consoli dating in the naturalgas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition t argets Canada which offers seemingly abundant naturalgas resources has attracted such US energy companies Calpine Devon and Duke which have al so bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year This particular a cquisition is significant because it positions Mirant which already had as sets in the Western part of Canada as the largest gas marketer in Canada a nd right behind Enron elsewhere in North America especially in the US Mi dwest and Northeast Further the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a de cided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the Unit ed States adding upon its alreadysignificant portfolio As always when discussing a merger or acquisition I like to first establis h the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains of the parties involved Mirant is of course the recently spun off former subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulat ed wholesale sector The companys business model is founded on building a huge arsenal of generating assets particularly based in natural gas which can be marketed and traded in strategic regions Even before the announcem ent of this acquisition Mirant owned an estimated billion cubic feet of proven oil and gas reserves percent of which are natural gas Accordin g to the company a substantial portion of its million cubic feet equiva lent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an a verage fixed price of MMBtu through Further Mirant has establishe d a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and Sout h America Europe and Asia The purchase of TransCanadas gas marketing bu siness will add billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirants existing volumes based on TransCanadas trading volumes which as no ted significantly elevates Mirants stature in the gasmarketing space The most important thing to note about TransCanadas business model is that the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas fro m Alaskas Prudhoe Bay and Canadas Mackenzie Delta into the growing North American marketplace supporting two separate pipelines one from each basi n This has been a slowgrowth business for TransCanada and in fact has l ost money over the last year but is positioned for strong growth in the fu ture given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North Americ a TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for s ome time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas t ransmission and electrical power services Last month the company sold ano ther chunk of its US naturalgas marketing and trading operations to BP G as and Power Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively o n this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts b etween its marketing shipping business and pipeline systems From a broad perspective this is a good move for Mirant As noted the com pany already has assets in Western Canada where it has operated since June through its management of the naturalgas marketing operations of Pan Alberta Gas Ltd and CanWest Gas Supply Inc The purchase of core busines ses of TransCanada extends Mirants presence into Eastern Canada by gaining control over TransCanadas Quebec and Ontario operations Specifically Mi rant gains control over TransCanadas naturalgas trading and marketing bus iness and the related transportation and storage contracts with business c ontracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States In addition TransCana da has agreed to sell its netback pool or the part of its operation that has aggregated gas supply from about naturalgas producers As noted the aggregated supply should increase Mirants marketable reserves by b illion cubic feet per day Although financial terms were not disclosed a M irant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to establish a leading market position through minimal investment The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in v ery well to Mirants growth strategy Just this week Mirant announced that it had acquired an interest in naturalgas and oil producing fields as well as acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Ener gy This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corp oration The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities wou ld bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling MW in North America by Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a MW natural gasfired power plant in Thomaston Ga and a MW natural gas fired plant in New Port Richey Fla north of Tampa The agreement is expe cted to close this month pending regulatory and thirdparty approvals As noted Mirant is just the latest in a string of US energy companies th at have made purchases of Canadian gas companies Driven by what appear to be abundant naturalgas reserve fields in Canada and uncertain resources i n more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico the gas consolidation movement among US energy companies includes acquiring those firms that ar e involved in both production and transportation of natural gas Some recen t reports Ive seen have indicated that since naturalgas imports to the United States mostly coming from Canada have doubled to about bil lion cubic feet per day while domestic production has increased only per cent although it still averages billion cubic feet per day Further a ccording to the Department of Energy US imports of natural gas from Cana da have averaged about percent of total US usage during the Uni ted States consumed Tcf and imported about Tcf mostly from Canada The other factor driving this interest in Canadian naturalgas firms is the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy which announced its purchase of Canadas Westcoast Energy for billion in late September Westcoast Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United S tates which is a booming market for naturalgas demand given its use in ne w power plant projects The acquisition should give Duke control over natur algas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it It is import ant to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian naturalgas marke t by focusing on the transportation of the commodity Mirant is taking a di fferent approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business Also wo rth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy which is buying Anderson Exploration which reportedly will position it as the largest independent producer of oil and natural gas in North America Ironically this increased interest in Canadian naturalgas firms is taking place at a time when Canadian naturalgas storage levels could be much hig her than reported bringing prices down to CAN per million cubic fe et over the next few weeks In fact naturalgas prices in Canada have drop ped about percent since the beginning of with Albertas benchmark AECOC Hub prices dropping more than percent in the past two months In addition to the high storage levels mild weather a drop in consumption of natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered to be factors in the drop in prices However this does appear to be a temp orary trend and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once again increase starting with the imminent winter season Moreover as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant the secondlargest gas marketer in North America According to the most cur rent data available based on sales Enron Wholesale Services remains the largest naturalgas marketer in North America with billion cubic feet day of sales in representing an percent increase over levels Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Dynegy Marketing and Trade Co ral Energy and Reliant Energy round out the top companies Interestingly Mirant was not even listed on the year sales ranking because it did no t fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year Conse quently the ascendance into the top tier of naturalgas marketers that Mir ant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite imp ressive An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters El Paso Corp NYSE EPG was cleared on Oct of manipulating naturalgas prices in California but the agency judge overse eing the case expressed impatience with company executives who engaged in w hat he described as hanky panky in arranging pipeline shipments Curtis W agner FERCs chief administrative law judge ruled that El Paso did not un fairly drive up naturalgas prices on its four pipelines into energystarve d California last year but used blunt language in assessing the behavior o f two executives with the Houstonbased energy giant Wagner said telephone records of the conversations showed blatant collusion between company af filiates in booking pipeline space at a discounted rate for future shipment s Analysis The best assessment of this ruling in the ongoing case against El Paso Corp is that it is a mixed bag of judgments and only one more step in what will continue to be a very long and drawnout case On one hand th e FERC administrative law judge appears to be absolving El Paso Corp of th e accusations that it intentionally manipulated conditions in California to gain market power over the states naturalgas market That is the good ne ws for El Paso Corp However on the other hand the same judge has also in tensified lingering claims that El Paso exclusively shared marketsensitive information between its affiliates violating a FERC standard of conduct t hat a pipeline must give information about naturalgas transportation to al l potential shippers as well as a companys own marketing affiliates Furth er as noted Judge Curtis Wagner has indicated that existing telephone reco rds from last year indicate blatant collusion between El Paso Corp compa ny affiliates potentially violating FERC rules that a pipelines operating staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate function independently of e ach other The next step in this case will be to determine any possible fin es that might be affixed by the full FERC commission on the basis of the al leged collusion or affiliate abuse issues The case against El Paso Corp is a very complicated one but it essentiall y comes down to one core issue The case revolves around allegations that d uring the period of May to November El Paso improperly shared markets ensitive information with one of its affiliates which drove up naturalgas prices preempted competition from nonaffiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range of billion for Californians El P aso Corp has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing The case has carried enormous significance for the energy industry as it impac ts not only the profits earned by El Paso Corp but also the degree to whic h federal regulators may continue to intercede into wholesale markets In a ddition the other key aspect to this case is the extent to which FERC und er the leadership of new Chairman Pat Wood will exhibit strong regulatory oversight over these claims of market abuse and issue its own harsh financi al penalties against El Paso Corp What is critically new about this case is the information now available fro m transcripts of phone conversations between El Paso affiliates First let me establish some background that will help to explain the significance of the transcripts El Paso Corp is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natur al Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy which are the companies in question reg arding the California transactions El Paso Natural Gas a regulated compan y operates pipelines and El Paso Merchant Energy which is unregulated ma rkets natural gas El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Divisio n pipeline which includes miles of interstate transmission pipeline serving markets in California the southwestern United States northern M exico and throughout the Rocky Mountains In early El Paso Natural G as awarded approximately onethird of the capacity on this interstate pipel ine to El Paso Merchant Energy This contract essentially gave subsidiaries of El Paso Corp control over transporting about onesixth of the states daily demand in California As such this gave the El Paso affiliates betwe en and percent of the Southern California gas market clearly positio ning it as the largest naturalgas provider in the state As subsidiaries all of El Pasos operations fall under FERCs armslength rule which enforces a separation between affiliated production and pipel ine companies that exist within a corporate family Since early FERC has been examining allegations that El Paso manipulated naturalgas prices in California by blocking competitors access to the interstate pipeline C alifornia officials have claimed that El Paso subsidiaries secretly shared information about the pipeline that was not available to other companies S pecifically the transcripts of phone conversations between executives at E l Paso Merchant and Mojave Pipeline Co an El Paso affiliate reportedly i nclude comments from El Paso Merchant that inquire about a delay in publish ing information about the pipelines available capacity to all potential co mpetitors The existence of these phone records gave some credence to ongoing claims t hat El Paso had shared what should have been public information only with i ts affiliates According to Reuters the executive at El Paso Merchant aske d the executive at Mojave Pipeline to hold off on posting competitive data about the capacity on the pipeline for a week This allegation has importan t ramifications First the sharing of this nonpublic information might me an that El Pasos subsidiaries had provided preferential treatment to affil iated subsidiaries which gave the company as a whole an unlawful advantage over competitors Any potential abuse of affiliate standards could include the unlawful exchange of classified information between subsidiaries or th e extension of discounted prices between two affiliated companies Yet acc ording to Judge Wagner this sharing of information among affiliates did not contribute to a clear case of market power abuse and in fact should be di smissed outright which is why the ruling is such a mixed bag for El Paso C orp Nevertheless the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC Pacific Ga s Electric Co and Southern California Edison may continue to fight the c ase with an appeal on the ruling that could be launched within days Acc ording to the California parties this alleged manipulation cost California ns an extra billion in unnecessary power purchase costs that the two u tilities are still attempting to recover It is important to note that San Diego Gas Electric Californias third IOU purchases all of its natural gas supply from Southern California Gas and is therefore not a participant in this case against El Paso In response El Paso has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing including market manipulation or inappropriate sharing of information between its affiliate s and thus has not violated any standards set out by FERC in its armslen gth policy applied to affiliates Instead El Paso claims that the seeming ly high prices that it charged in California resulted solely from nationall y high gas prices However according to the Energy Information Administrat ion delivery prices for natural gas in California during the October to January timeframe were considerably higher than other national mark ets For instance during this time period naturalgas prices in Californi a were running near MMBtu while prices at Henry Hub and in Florida wer e at around MMBtu El Paso says the sudden drop in naturalgas prices once its contract on the pipeline expired is the result of constraints that are inherent in Califor nias distribution system In addition the company claims that mild weathe r in the region and increased storage levels of natural gas have also drive n the dramatic price swing Further El Paso says that it hedged most of it s gas capacity into California to protect itself from potential losses cut ting potential profits in the process The significance of this El Paso co ntends is that the companys hedging indicates that it had no foreknowledg e that gas prices would be higher than normal In other words El Paso hedg ed on its gas supply because the company thought that prices would be flat or go down On the other hand hedging is a common practice among seasoned traders and gas traders have countered that hedged contracts are often reso ld at higher multiples before the gas is ultimately delivered It will be interesting to see where this case goes from here As noted the new FERC that has emerged under the leadership of Pat Wood may demonstra te a decidedly lower tolerance for any allegations of affiliate abuse and c onsequently issue stiff penalties In addition it is interesting to note t hat other pending affiliate abuse cases have recently been launched by FERC indicating that the commission is increasing its efforts to investigate s uch abuse For instance last week FERC ordered an inquiry into whether Exe lon Corp PECO Energy and their affiliates improperly manipulated Northeas t power markets in by possibly sharing nonpublic information Further Wood has made no bones about the fact that he embraces a market philosoph y that includes regulatory intervention when necessary Consequently Wood could very well spearhead a reexamination of FERCs methodology regarding marketbased rates in markets that become deregulated along with how merch ant plants calculate their rates and the ruling on potential fines against El Paso Corp could be the first indication of this policy change An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

a consent decree with the attorneys general of states To satisfy the FTCs apprehension that the merger as initially proposed would violate antitrust law Texaco agreed to divest its US refining and marketing affiliates Texaco refines crude oil in the United States under two separate affiliates Equilon Enterprises and Motiva Enterprises The company owns a percent interest in Equilon with the remainder belonging to Shell Texaco and Saudi Refining each own percent of Motiva The rest is owned by Shell In addition Texaco will sell its onethird interest in the Discovery naturalgas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and its general aviation businesses in states Although Texaco and Chevron have been rivals the two companies have a long business relationship For the past years they have coowned a prosperous joint venture called Caltex which sells million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products per day with operations in countries Caltex refines crude oil and marketing petroleum products LNG and gas products with a workforce of more than Revenues for the company and its affiliates were billion in This merger appears to be a good fit for many reasons One benefit is that the two companies have many complementary operations internationally including West Africa and Brazil home to some of the worlds largest new oil fields The new company will have a leadership position in power generation Texacos power and gasification business with equity interests in megawatts of power operating or under construction and Chevrons percent stake in Dynegy Inc will strengthen the companys position in the gasification and power generation markets In addition the sheer size of the new company should allow it to better cope with fluctuating crude prices and provide a greater ability to undertake global projects that are growing in complexity size and cost The stock market attests to these economies of scale The stock prices for Chevron and Texaco though up about percent and percent over the past five years have underperformed those of the gargantuan players like ExxonMobil and BP After gaining enormous size through mergers in recent years these two companies have seen their shares return about percent and percent respectively ExxonMobil and BP have seen their priceearnings multiples command significant premiums as well Chevron and Texaco currently have priceearnings multiples of about and respectively while BP and ExxonMobil command priceearnings multiples of approximately and respectively These significant stock price premiums that ExxonMobil and BP have obtained after their mergers bode nicely for ChevronTexaco It now joins the ranks of these major players As mentioned earlier in terms of market capitalization the new company will rank second among US energy companies and fourth among global energy companies with a market capitalization approaching billion The new company expects to reduce costs by at least billion per year within six to nine months of the mergers completion The most significant savings approximately million are projected to come from more efficient exploration and production activities An additional million is expected to come from the consolidation of corporate functions and million from other operations The company anticipates that the combined workforce of about will be reduced by approximately percent worldwide These projected expense reductions of billion could be just an initial payoff Looking at the recent mergers of BP and ExxonMobil history suggests that the major oil companies underestimate their scope for slashing costs For example since the merger of Exxon and Mobil in savings estimates have been raised by about billion in each of the years to In addition BP has almost doubled initial savings expectations in its various mergers to billion from billion So it is not inconceivable that the merger could reduce costs perhaps up to twice as much as currently projected and that would translate into earnings for next year and beyond being much higher than anticipated The creation of ChevronTexaco adds a new player to the oil and gas elite Rather than being acquired by ExxonMobil Corp BP Amoco Plc or Royal Dutch Shell Group as was becoming more likely with each passing month Chevron and Texaco became their equal An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Business Wire Gulfstream National Gas System announced tod ay that it has received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC approva l to commence mainline pipeline construction in Florida With this approval Gulfstream now has all the major segments of its mile pipeline projec t under construction and on schedule to deliver natural gas in June Analysis The Gulfstream Natural Gas System which is by far the largest pi peline project in the Southeast has been designed specifically to deliver natural gas into the Florida wholesale market When finished the project r eportedly will be the largest naturalgas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico w ith capacity to transport approximately billion cubic feet of natural g as per day and the first new transportation system to serve Florida in mor e than years Williams NYSE WMB and Duke Energy NYSE DUK jointly o wn the pipeline having purchased it from Coastal Corp last year a sale t hat was made possible due to regulatory requirements surrounding Coastals merger with El Paso Corp Along with projects still being led by El Paso Co rp NYSE EPG the Gulfstream project highlights the continuing emphasis on pipeline construction which by some accounts is experiencing the larges t wave of expansion since the early s Williams and Duke have provided a current status report regarding construct ion of the pipeline including notice that more than of the miles o f offshore pipeline have been laid in the Gulf of Mexico Gulfstream also h as already laid pipe in parts of Florida and Alabama some of the more sens itive regions along the pipelines path Like other pipeline developments the Gulfstream project the construction for which began on June is being driven by several factors includ ing demand which for the most part remains strong the prominence of natu ral gas as the fuel source for new power plants and a presidential administ ration that is supportive of production What is perhaps most interesting a bout the boom in pipeline construction is that many of the same companies t hat own or control naturalgas supplies are also quickly acquiring or partn ering with other firms that specialize in pipeline construction For background subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their in tent to jointly purchase Coastal Corps percent interest in the Gulfst ream Natural Gas System project in November The project was originall y sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp a billion Houstonbased e nergy holding company with operations in naturalgas production distributi on and marketing However due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Co rps merger with El Paso Energy Corp Coastal Corp was forced by the Fed eral Trade Commission to divest the project As a result Duke Energy and W illiams found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida market Approximately miles of the route which originates in Mobile Ala cro sses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters Gul fstream offers billion cubic feet of naturalgas capacity per day and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and powergeneration facil ities that plan on using highefficiency naturalgas turbines Already the project has precedent agreements with large Florida utilities and power generation facilities Duke and Williams have agreed to jointly manage the operation and developme nt of the Gulfstream project Its not difficult to assess why Duke and Wil liams would be willing to coown the project The two companies which have historically had a collaborative relationship already own significant amo unts of interstate naturalgas pipeline capacity Between its two subsidiar ies involved in naturalgas productionDuke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas TransmissionDuke Energy owns and operates about miles of pipeline and interstate miles of capacity Williams five interstat e naturalgas pipelines reportedly deliver about percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States The companys vast mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada serving mo re than million residential commercial and industrial naturalgas users In fact the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeli ne project in Florida a mile pipeline that would have followed a simil ar route as the Gulfstream project will follow Duke and Williams are no lo nger planning the Buccaneer project now that they have acquired the Gulfstr eam project The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and o ffer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Fl orida The CEO of Williams gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market woul d support only one new pipeline coming into the state By joining together Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the highgrowth state as it event ually becomes competitive First among the priorities for the project is to ensure adequate pipeline capacity by June and meeting the projected MW electric generation growth that is expected in the state of Flori da by Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project acce lerates its own entry into Florida In fact Richard Priory Dukes CEO co nceded at a conference last year that Dukes future success would result fr om its naturalgas operations Specifically Duke has been focused on merch ant plant and naturalgas pipeline construction for some time As of this s ummer Duke was rated third in announced merchant plants behind Calpine an d Panda and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centere d around building additional merchant plants and acquiring naturalgas pipe lines Thus the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new ge neration as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from tril lion to trillion cubic feet per year by In addition coal and nucl ear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last t wo decades at a time when naturalgas prices were comparatively low All o f these factors have created a strong market for naturalgas generation Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market so thi s pipeline could facilitate easier expansion in the state About a year ago the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach However the states three IOUs ap pealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court arguing that merchant pla nts were not allowed under state law The Florida Supreme Court overturned the decision of the state PSC blocking Dukes entry into the state Conseq uently Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as a nother way to get into the Florida market and one that is potentially more profitable Along with Duke and Williams El Paso Energy Corp also is focused on build ing and acquiring new pipeline capacity The company is the parent of subsi diaries El Paso Natural Gas a regulated company that operates pipelines a nd El Paso Merchant Energy an unregulated company that markets natural gas El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Division pipeline which includes miles of interstate pipeline serving markets in Californi a the southwestern United States and throughout the Rocky Mountains In fa ct El Paso owns and operates the largest naturalgas pipeline in North Ame

rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News report from Power Finance Risk Endesa Spains largest utility is setting up a business development unit in New York and will shortly transf er three executives from its Madrid headquarters to seek out investment opp ortunities in the United States Virginia Sanz de Madrid a Spanish utility analyst at Deutsche Bank in Madrid says Endesa is probably looking to acq uire existing generation or distribution companies rather than develop new assets from scratch She adds that Endesa is looking to spend some to billion to enter the US energy market Analysis A common response to reports that Endesa is attempting to expand in the United States may be Why has the company waited so long Along with affording new opportunities for domestic companies deregulation of the U S electric market has also enticed several large European power firms to e xpand their scales through a stateside acquisition Thus some financial an alysts may wonder if Endesa is jumping on the USexpansion bandwagon too late The timing may still be right for Endesa however considering that f alling wholesale electricity prices across the United States and the decrea sed value of generation assets over the last few months could actually make a US generation purchase more lucrative today than in recent years Cons equently Endesas rumored expansion efforts in the United States and cont inuing acquisitions across continental Europe are part of the companys ag gressive growth strategy Under the monopoly system in Spain Endesa was clearly the countrys larges t power firm owning about MW of generating capacity and controlling percent of Spains electricity market However due to its own move tow ard privatization the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the do mestic growth of the countrys largest electric companies requiring Endesa to look abroad for growth opportunities Thus for some time there has bee n little question that Endesa would like to develop interests across contin ental Europe and is not going to let any dust settle before it continues t o expand The fact that Endesa also plans to expand in the United States re presents a new but not necessarily surprising direction for the company The impetus for Endesa moving into the United States beyond the opportunit ies for growth that exist in this country may be rooted in some setbacks t hat Endesa has experienced in Spain and minimal acquisition opportunities a cross continental Europe In late Endesa made its first significant m ove outside of Spain when it purchased a percent interest in the French electricity generator Societe Nationale dElectricite et de Thermique SNET While a comparatively small company by American standards SNET is the s econdlargest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity and third largest in terms of electricity generation SNET owns five coal plants totaling megawatts which generate about GWh annually T his is a very low output and in fact SNET accounts for only percent of the market share in France However given the fact that Frances largest energy company EDF still has a hold on about percent of the market in the country the acquisition of the nextlargest company was a major coup The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the compan ys experience in coalbased electricitywhich still is the power source fo r roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continentand its pro gressiveness in terms of technology Upon the acquisition of SNET Endesa began friendly merger proceedings with Iberdrola the secondlargest power firm in Spain Under the nowterminate d deal Endesa would have purchased Iberdrola for about billion and c reated a new entity well prepared to expand across Europe and Latin America Reportedly the merger would have created the worlds thirdbiggest elect ricity company after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron and without question would have marked Spains largest industrial merger to date For further pe rspective the new company created by the merger between Endesa and Iberdro la would have had a combined market capitalization of approximately bill ion euros or billion in US terms This would have surpassed Duke En ergys market capitalization of billion and been roughly the size of American Electric Power TXU and Reliant put together resulting in a million market capitalization Had it materialized the merger also woul d have given a considerable jolt to Spains fastgrowing power market and altered the current playing field among Europes largest power companies However in a major setback for Endesas growth Spanish authorities requir ed that the merged company sell off some generating capacity arguing that Spain needed new players to increase competition The government also ruled that the new entity would have to lower its market share of distribution and authorities cut the amount of stranded costs that the new company would be able to recoup Although analysts had expected the merger to proceed de spite the government conditions Endesa and Iberdrola said the imposed gove rnmental conditions outweighed the benefits of the merger which would crea te fewer synergies than initially proposed Ironically much of the funding for Endesas purchases have come from the sales of its own nonstrategic a ssets that took place in preparation for the Iberdrola acquisition Moreover the inability to grow its scale through the purchase of Iberdrola has apparently prompted Endesa to concentrate on finding new acquisition o pportunities In addition to expansion into the United States last month E ndesa led a consortium that will acquire the generation assets of Enel Ita lys largest generating company for billion euros The generating ass ets which are housed under a subsidiary company known as Elettrogen inclu de an installed capacity of MW that is ranked as the secondlargest g enerating firm in Italy Elettrogen is one of three companies in which Enel grouped its generation assets in order to comply with Italian regulatory m andates regarding divestiture The purchase of Elettrogen marks the first s ignificant expansion of Endesa beyond its home territory in Spain In the p urchase agreement Endesa will have percent ownership of Elettrogen par tnering with Banco Santander Central Hispano percent a Spanish bank and Italian ASM Brescia percent a municipal utility that serves customers in Italy The acquisition of Elettrogen is an important component of Endesas expansi on strategy across Europe and may be an indication of how the company inten ds to progress in the United States Endesa has established a goal of accum ulating MW of generating capacity beyond its existing assets in Spain by Through the purchase of Elettrogen and the previous purchase of S NET Endesa has already reached that goal four years ahead of schedule If Endesa does make a purchase of a US company it will most likely be an acquisition that involves substantial generating assets as power generati on has become Endesas primary focus To date there have been a handful of instances in which an international power firm has bought a US energy co mpany since deregulation began four years ago ScottishPower purchased Paci fiCorp National Grid purchased New England Electric System NEES and East ern Utilities Associates EUA and Powergen bought LGE Note that all of these buying companies are based in the United Kingdom Pending internation al deals include National Grids purchase of Niagara Mohawk and the German company RWEs purchase of American Water Works and EDF has made it clear t hat it also wants to expand in the United States Generally speaking inter national power firms have used the purchase of either vertically integrated utilities or unbundled businesses as a testing ground to learn the ins a nd outs of the US energy market and plan subsequent specialization in a p articular market niche Further although international companies such as N ational Grid are focused on the transmission side of the US energy indust ry the generation sector clearly offers solid opportunities for growth In the spring of President Bush released an energy plan that calls for significant new energy production efforts which opened up new windows of o pportunity for international companies to further expand in

Surplus By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from the Los Angeles Times After months of defending the bi llion worth of longterm electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal f of the state S David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha t the contracts be renegotiated perhaps through the California Power and C onservation Financing Authority a new public power agency he now chairs There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be renegotiated said Freeman noting that critics of the contracts include G ov Gray Davis the president of the California Public Utilities Commission and the leader of the State Senate Freeman said he is still proud of his work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as gougers and pirates but Californias energy picture has vastly changed sin ce January Analysis Oh yeah the California energy crisis remember that For some it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an illf ated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating con sequences especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headline s in the energy industry Nevertheless it should not be forgotten that ev en though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continu e to plague the state As one of the main resolution steps that were taken to repair the dysfunctional market the state of California stepped into a very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the states three IOUs Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on their own In an ironic twist indicating that Californias problems are far from over the stabilization of the states markets are now in essence cau sing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questio nable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis At issue presently are some longterm contracts that the state of Califo rnia through its Department of Water Resources signed with power generato rs such as Calpine NYSE CPN Duke NYSE DUK Mirant NYSE MIR and W illiams NYSE WMB to name a few back in early a time at which whole sale power prices were still running at very high levels One of the primar y benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the states reliance on t he volatile spot market where prices had soared as high as MWh As a whole the contracts are worth about billion and have a lifespan of y ears or more Some might argue that Gov Davis who led the effort for the state to assume the role of power purchaser felt pressure to sign the cont racts at that time due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solven cy of Pacific Gas Electric and SCE in particular However critics argue that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices were the highest Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary b ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned First a good nu mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times i ncluding those of low demand such as the morning This leaves the state w ith a surplus of power that it does not need which it in turn has been for ced to sell at a loss We also know that as a general observation the sta te bought power under the longterm contracts at an average price of MW h That same power reportedly will sell for only MWh in As noted Freeman who previously managed the municipal utility known as th e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently assumed the managemen t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at the request of Gov Davis The agency was charged with quelling the extreme situation that California faced over the last year including soaring powe r prices and blackouts Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub sided Freemans new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time Let me try to put Freemans plan into a nutshell As a state agency the Po wer Authority could sell up to billion in revenue bonds which would be guaranteed by energy sales to lease build or buy power plants Consequent ly the state which can borrow money at belowmarket rates is in a positi on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could As a carr ot to entice the renegotiation of the longterm contracts the state could offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants in the state In other words the state would carry the investment for the costs of the new plants alleviating pressure on the private companies to p rovide a percent return to their shareholders Note that most of the gen erating companies involved in longterm contracts with California are commi tted to building new power plants anyway Some reports Ive seen indicate t hat percent of the contracts that the state has signed include clause s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st ate However under normal circumstances the expense of building the new p lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds of millions of dollars Thus in return for the financial incentive the s ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long term contracts with the state of California presumably based on current m arket conditions Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri ces in the contracts or providing the state with more flexibility on the t iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s ome legs Nevertheless word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that California is presently suffering from an energy glut unused electricity that may end up costing ratepayers as much as billion over the next de cade The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased conservation efforts which brought demand down a condition that was maint ained by comparatively moderate weather trends The end result is that the state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of the customers served by the three IOUs and the state unfortunately cannot sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit For instance according to a report by the Department of Water Resources in one threemonth lowu sage period expected in the spring of percent of the power for whi ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to c ents on the dollar ultimately costing utility customers as much as mi llion The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r each its peak in and then gradually decline through Consequently despite the financial advantages of Freemans plan the logis tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy In add ition some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea dy own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be e asily convinced to build new plants right away For instance Calpine Corp which is one of the companies that has signed a longterm deal with the s tate of California responded to the plan as saying that it wouldnt be an ything that Calpine would use The company reportedly has finished three n ew power plants since June and would not be enticed by the financing i ncentive that the state is orchestrating Further the states desire to re negotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept Ever since wholesale prices began to drop earlier this year the renegotiation debate has been a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings However since t he onset of the talks a good number of the generating companies have maint ained that renegotiation would not be possible as they had already locked themselves into deals with naturalgas suppliers Thus one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources a t least in the near term which could set the state up for another dangerou s boomandbust cycle down the road In addition those companies that alre ady have longterm contracts with the state such as Calpine may not be en ticed by the financing incentive and those companies that dont have long term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl ants in California All of this could create a situation in which Californi a has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in a nother shortage situation or more years down the line Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt to take over some of Pacific Gas Electric Cos physical assets Instead of its transmission lines however the state now is examining its opportun ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network including dams and powerho uses owned by the states largest electric utility Note that under its re structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval Pacific G as Electric Co would split from its parent PGE Corp and transfer gen erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie s which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC State regulators do not like this plan and thus are se eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o f Pacific Gas Electric Co Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control Moreover even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m arket state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental parts of the states energy infrastructure Remember that Gov Davis spent much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE and SDGE for the purchase of the utilities transmission networks Pacifi c Gas Electric Co never was interested in selling its transmission asset s which it believed the states offer grossly undervalued One of the main reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume o peration of the complex transmission networks Nevertheless in addition to renegotiating the longterm contracts the state is still pursuing at leas t the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas Electric An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look forward to

still proud of his work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as gougers and pirates but Californias energy picture has vastly changed sin ce January Analysis Oh yeah the California energy crisis remember that For som e it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill fated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating c onsequences especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headli nes in the energy industry Nevertheless it should not be forgotten that even though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis conti nue to plague the state As one of the main resolution steps that were take n to repair the dysfunctional market the state of California stepped into a very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the states three IOUs Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co which due to credit problems were unable to secure power o n their own In an ironic twist indicating that Californias problems are f ar from over the stabilization of the states markets are now in essence c ausing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be quest ionable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis At issue presently are some longterm contracts that the state of Califo rnia through its Department of Water Resources signed with power generato rs such as Calpine NYSE CPN Duke NYSE DUK Mirant NYSE MIR and W illiams NYSE WMB back in early at a time at which wholesale power prices were still running at very high levels One of the primary benefits of the contracts was that it reduced the states reliance on the volatile s pot market where prices had soared as high as MWh As a whole the con tracts are worth about billion and have a lifespan of years or more Some might argue that Gov Davis who led the effort for the state to assu me the role of power purchaser felt pressure to sign the contracts at that time due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solvency of Pacific Gas Electric and SCE in particular However critics argue that the cont racts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices were the high est Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary b ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned First a good nu mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times i ncluding those of low demand such as the morning This leaves the state w ith a surplus of power that it does not need which it in turn has been for ced to sell at a loss We also know that as a general observation the sta te bought power under the longterm contracts at an average price of MW h That same power reportedly will sell for only MWh in As noted Freeman who previously managed the municipal utility known as th e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently assumed the managemen t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at the request of Gov Davis The agency was charged with quelling the extreme situation that California faced over the last year including soaring powe r prices and blackouts Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub sided Freemans new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time Let me try to put Freemans plan into a nutshell As a state agency the Po wer Authority could sell up to billion in revenue bonds which would be guaranteed by energy sales to lease build or buy power plants Consequent ly the state which can borrow money at belowmarket rates is in a positi on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could As a carr ot to entice the renegotiation of the longterm contracts the state could offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants in the state In other words the state would carry the investment for the costs of the new plants alleviating pressure on the private companies to p rovide a percent return to their shareholders Note that most of the gen erating companies involved in longterm contracts with California are commi tted to building new power plants anyway Some reports Ive seen indicate t hat percent of the contracts that the state has signed include clause s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st ate However under normal circumstances the expense of building the new p lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds of millions of dollars Thus in return for the financial incentive the s ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long term contracts with the state of California presumably based on current m arket conditions Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri ces in the contracts or providing the state with more flexibility on the t iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s ome legs Nevertheless word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that California is presently suffering from an energy glut unused electricity that may end up costing ratepayers as much as billion over the next de cade The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased conservation efforts which brought demand down a condition that was maint ained by comparatively moderate weather trends The end result is that the state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of the customers served by the three IOUs and the state unfortunately cannot sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit For instance according to a report by the Department of Water Resources in one threemonth lowu sage period expected in the spring of percent of the power for whi ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to c ents on the dollar ultimately costing utility customers as much as mi llion The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r each its peak in and then gradually decline through Consequently despite the financial advantages of Freemans plan the logis tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy In add ition some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea dy own a large amount of generation capacity in the state and may not be ea sily convinced to build new plants right away For instance Calpine Corp which is one of the companies that has signed a longterm deal with the st ate of California responded to the plan as saying that it wouldnt be any thing that Calpine would use The company reportedly has finished three ne w power plants since June and would not be enticed by the financing in centive that the state is orchestrating Further the states desire to ren egotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept Ever since wholesale prices began to drop earlier this year the renegotiation debate has been a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings However since th e onset of the talks a good number of the generating companies have mainta ined that renegotiation would not be possible as they had already locked t hemselves into deals with naturalgas suppliers Thus one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources a t least in the near term which could set the state up for another dangerou s boomandbust cycle down the road In addition those companies that alre ady have longterm contracts with the state such as Calpine may not be en ticed by the financing incentive and those companies that dont have long term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl ants in the state All of this could create a situation in which California has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in an other shortage situation or more years down the line Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt to take over some of Pacific Gas Electric Cos physical assets Instead of its transmission lines however the state now is examining its opportun ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network including dams and powerho uses owned by the states largest electric utility Note that under its re structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval Pacific G as Electric Co would split from its parent PGE Corp and transfer gen erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie s which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC State regulators do not like this plan and thus are se eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o f Pacific Gas Electric Co Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control Moreover even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m arket state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental parts of the states energy infrastructure Remember that Gov Davis spent much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE and SDGE for the purchase of the utilities transmission networks Pacifi c Gas Electric Co never was interested in selling its transmission asset s which it believed the states offer grossly undervalued One of the main reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern by state legislators who argued the state was ill equipped to assume operat ion of the complex transmission networks Nevertheless in addition to rene gotiating the longterm contracts the state is still pursuing at least the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas Electric An archive list of previous

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from PR Newswire Conectiv NYSE CIV an energy provider locat ed in the MidAtlantic announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Atlanti c City Electric Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in t hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company The ownership interests were sold for approximately million excluding re imbursement of estimated fuel inventory subject to adjustment Analysis This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week but I di d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development The transfer of ownershi p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b ecause of its relation to Conectivs unique competitive strategy and the ro undrobin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat es Further despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation s nuclear facilities we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectivs owne rship in the plants which Conectiv shares with other companies who also h appen to be the buying partners in this sale The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows A percent interest MW in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U nits and sold in equal shares to coowners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon Pri or to the transaction PSEG Nuclear an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi ce Enterprise Group Incorporated and Exelon each owned about percent of the Peach Bottom plant Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit y A percent interest MW in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un its and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which prior to the sale owned about percent of the facility PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla nt A percent interest MW in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U nits and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which is the operator of the plant a nd prior to the sale owned percent of the facility As noted the significance of these transactions relates to Conectivs comp etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector Lets look at Conectiv first According to Conectivs President and COO Thomas Shaw the divestiture of t he nuclear assets is consistent with the companys focused business strateg y on two core energy businesses Conectiv Energy the companys integrated generation and asset optimization group and Conectiv Power Delivery the c ompanys regulated delivery business To support this twotiered focus Con ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t o expand a generation portfolio that includes only midmerit plants units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns Midmerit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant s and peaker units Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent a midmerit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent to percent From Conectivs perspective the value of the midmerit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op erate only when demand is comparatively high Further the company believes that midmerit units are ideally suited to support the companys energy tr ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of MW of bas eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power Light a subsidiary of Conect iv to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectivs telecommunications busi ness Conectiv Communications to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond Va for million In addition Conectiv sold its percent stake in a MW co generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP a nonut ility electric generator for million Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own ership of some MW of midmerit generation in the MidAtlantic region The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r epay debt and fund Conectivs development of additional midmerit assets C onectivs immediate goal is to build more than MW of midmerit power generation within the MidAtlantic region by Toward that end Conecti v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon ey to support a million MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S tation which is currently a MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur al gas The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge neration supports Conectivs strategy of refocusing on its core businesses which are power trading and wholesale marketing through midmerit units only and a regulated delivery business Conectiv Power Delivery provides e nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey Delaware M aryland and Virginia Given the fairly distinct line between Conectivs re gulated and unregulated businesses I have previously speculated that Conec tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand alone company a trend represented by AEP Reliant and UtiliCorp Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring so it is unlikely that any such sp in off of its generation business would take place in the near term Howeve r as far as I know Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e xclusively on midmerit plants Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco a partnership t hat is scheduled to close in April In this deal Pepco is acquiring C onectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at billion Both co mpanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date The partnership between these two relatively small and regional ly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity d elivery company in the MidAtlantic region By combining their two electric ity delivery businesses Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doubl e their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times In the nuclear sector it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con ectiv despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj ority ownership in the plants Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclearpower space and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li cense exchange on these three plants Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind ustry owning a total of reactors Earlier this year Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years and did not rule out the fact that his company migh t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility As noted PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente rprise Group Inc which in was split into PSEG a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power an unregulated US power generation company As noted PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek NJ and oversees PSEG Powers ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station located in Delta Pa When the Conectiv transaction is completed PSEG Power will own percent of Hope Creek percent of Salem and percent of Peach Bottom In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear Entergy Corp is another company th at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector Since Enter gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block Recently Entergy bought Con Edisons Indian Point Unit s and nuclear power plants in Westchester County NY In addition Ent ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat ion to purchase the MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon Vt for million With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale Enterg y will own a nuclear fleet that includes reactors Also note that the Ne w York State Public Service Commission PSC just approved the sale of Niag ara Mohawks Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about million The purchase prices for the MW Nine Mile and percent of the MW Nine Mile are about million and mill ion respectively Constellation is another company that has consistently i ncreased its nuclear power assets Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate d with coalfired generation many industry analysts have debated whether o r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence Exelon for example is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR Supporters of PBMR believe its relatively small size MW anticipated short construction time months and cost kW can once again make nuclear power an acceptable option In February of Exelon filed an application with th e US nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United States

Californias Intrastate NaturalGas Pipelines By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Associated Press California state power regulators voted D ec to deregulate further the transmission of natural gas within Souther n California a decision hailed by the industry and derided by consumer adv ocates The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC voted to appr ove a proposal that allows Southern California Gas Co the nations larges t gas utility and San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE to sell space on th eir backbone transmission pipelines These pipelines carry natural gas fr om out of state to a smaller distribution system in California that then tr ansports it to homes businesses factories and power plants Analysis This controversial vote by the CPUC took place last week but has not received a great amount of industry analysis This is rather surprisin g because the vote carries enormous potential impact for the way in which n aturalgas capacity is bought and sold along pipelines owned by Southern Ca lifornia Gas Co and SDGE in the southern part of the state Considering t he fiasco that opening the states electric market became over the last yea r it is a risky move for Californias regulators to open a competitive mar ket for the right to transport gas along these pipelines at this time even though the issue has been under debate at the commission for years Howeve r the rationale for the decision is that the new system will allow custome rs to better control the point from which their naturalgas supply originat es which theoretically should lower costs and preserve space along the pip elines that the customers dont need Critics of the plan especially The U tility Reform Network TURN say that allowing competition along the natur algas pipelines in California could allow fewer companies to control most of the pipeline space which could in fact cause the opposite of the intend ed effect and drive up energy costs A case that has been used by both side s of the debate is that of El Paso Corp which found itself in a lengthy l awsuit this year when it was charged with giving preferential access to its pipeline to one of its affiliates which allegedly played a role in drivin g up energy costs in the state Before analyzing the potential impact of the CPUCs ruling lets first est ablish specifically what the ruling entails and some background of the comp anies involved Put into a nutshell the ruling creates a competitive marke t for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owne d by Southern California Gas and SDGE which are both subsidiaries of San Diegobased Sempra Energy NYSE SRE As noted Southern California Gas is ranked as the largest naturalgas distribution utility in the country and serves a territory of squaremiles that ranges from central Californ ia to the Mexican border Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines i ncluding the ones that transport power into California both of these compa nies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their intrastate backbone pipelines giving customers firm transportation right s on the pipelines The pipelines are referred to as backbone because the y are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to fact ories and power plants along with homes and businesses It is important t o note that the CPUCs ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas i n California which includes electric generating plants Residential and sm all business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated gastransmission costs Under the new auction system power producers and industrial naturalgas cu stomers of the two companies will bid to buy pipeline space with preferenc e being given to those bidders that intend to reserve space for the longest period of time According to the CPUC the ruling creates three tiers of accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines The first tier includes re sidential and small business customers who are not included in the new com petition and will automatically have about million cubic feet per day of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use The second tier inclu des industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competi tion and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity The thi rd tier includes all other market participants including naturalgas marke ters which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left Both South ern California Gas and SDGE reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the end of for their largest customers to transport natural gas The aucti ons will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the b idding process As one option bidders can pay a fixed price of cents p er million British thermal units MMBtu that would cover all of the capaci ty on the pipeline that they have reserved regardless if it is ultimately used or not As a second option bidders can pay for only percent of the reserved capacity at the fixed price of cents per MMBtu and percen t at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately use In addition the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space an i mportant point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control o ver the pipeline than allotted in the ruling As noted the measure passed the CPUC in a vote The ruling will remain in place until at which time the commission can decide to renew it The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas Henr y Duque and Geoffrey Brown Loretta Lynch president of the CPUC and Carl Wood voted against the measure Wood said he opposed the measure because it was based on data accumulated before naturalgas prices dramatically incre ased during the winter of Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure wa s a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to ke ep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using inte rstate pipelines which are not regulated by the CPUC An exodus among indu strial users from intrastate pipelines according to the three commissioner s could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs a ssociated with maintaining the pipelines However regulators were quick to qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cos t of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total deregulation Instead the commissioners said that the ruling simply amount s to less regulation As I mentioned the case against El Paso Corp NYSE EPG was used as an e xample to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among the naturalgas intrastate pipelines The case against El Paso Corp is a v ery complicated one but it essentially comes down to one core issue The c ase revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November El Paso improperly shared marketsensitive information with one of its affiliates which drove up naturalgas prices preempted competition from nonaffiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range of billion for Californians El Paso Corp has consistently maintaine d that it engaged in no wrongdoing According to a report issued by the sta te Assembly naturalgas prices in California increased from billion i n to billion in to billion for only the first three mo nths of In October El Paso Corp was absolved of the charges of mani pulating naturalgas prices in California but an investigation continues r egarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates The releva nce of this case is that those opposed to opening up Californias intrastat e pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company t o step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be ab le to drive up price Those in favor of the CPUCs new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso case are unfounded For starters the ruling restricts companies from ownin g more than percent of the pipeline which theoretically should prevent a company from gaining an ability to control prices Critics however say that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space which could poten tially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than percent of pipeline capacity The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of t he remaining questions that only time will be able to answer Critics of th e ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the naturalgas pipeli nes creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the states electri city market which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulati on In other words TURN argues the CPUC ruling opens the door for one com pany to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along the intrastate gas pipelines thereby giving that company the opportunity t o control prices As the new ruling wont take effect until another year wh en Southern California Gas and SDGE begin receiving bids for capacity spac e on their pipelines we wont know any time soon if prices will be impacte d However critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in Californ ia during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indica tor of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energ y prices Moreover the opening of competition along capacity space on Californias i ntrastate naturalgas pipelines is a surprising departure from the states discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector It is too early to tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices and of course this ques tion is the source of great debate with one side saying that prices will d rop and the other side saying that prices will increase Perhaps the large r issue however is the control over the states pipelines that could be i mpacted by this ruling Even percent capacity control the amount that t he CPUC is opening to competition would be considered excessive by some ot her states For instance in Texas percent control is considered a maxim um standard Again whether or not the allowance of competition will spark the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that remains to be seen We do know that electric competition in California bec ame a disastrous experiment but even with this history the state is moving forward with bringing competition to its intrastate naturalgas pipelines An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

to Exelon Sale Supports Strategies of Both Companies By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PRNewswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU and Exelon Generation ann ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gasfired electric generating pla nts to Exelon Generation a subsidiary of Exelon Corp NYSE EXC for million The transaction involving two DallasFort Worth plants with a co mbined capacity of MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres ence in the Texas region enhancing its geographic and market diversity wh ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas Analysis Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st rategies of both companies particularly well TXU one of the largest gener ation companies in the world has been attempting to expand out of its home state of Texas for some time following competitive opportunities as they are presented by electric deregulation The company which will maintain a presence in the Texas market has already expanded internationally into cou ntries such as Australia and Europe and will mostly likely use the proceed s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni ted States For Exelon the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex as market which becomes fully competitive next week and provides a partic ularly valuable inroad into the highdemand region of DallasFort Worth Lets first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is selling to Exelon As noted the combined capacity of the two plants is abo ut MW One of the plants is the MW Handley Steam Electric Stati on which is located southeast of Fort Worth According to TXU bar rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oilgas units at the plant Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington The first unit was put into operation in with the additional units coming on line in and The other plant being sold is the MW Mountain Creek St eam Electric Station which is located about two miles west of Loop in D allas With the first oilgas unit established in four more units wer e added in and Both sales include the generating un its of the plants along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo r them to operate land water rights transmission interconnections gas p ipeline interconnections production facilities and emission allowances The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr etty straightforward From TXUs perspective the sales will reduce the com panys generation concentration in a single US market which up to this p oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas Proceeds from the sale apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke ts outside of Texas In addition proceeds from the sale will be used to st rengthen TXUs balance sheet by reducing debt something that has become in creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s pace since the bankruptcy of marketleader Enron It is important to note t hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market and still intends to operate in the state as a generation company and retailer Note that according to Texas restructuring law there must be a wall between the two operating uni ts which must function as separate companies In essence the divestiture is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w ill support growth into other markets and reduce the amount of potential m arket power that the company may have in Texas The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l atter half of this year considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene rgy Regulatory Commission FERC have forced several other companies to cha rge costbased prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to hold market power in their particular service territories Texas law allow s a company to own and control no more than percent of capacity within t he Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT and TXU claims that it is within this cap However TXU acknowledges that it had an overconcentrati on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar kets Excluding the sold facilities TXU will now own MW of net capa city which are still located primarily in Texas However it is becoming c lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market From Exelons perspective the sale expands the companys generating capaci ty by about percent which is an important increase considering that Exe lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industrys largest assetbased traders Exelon which was created as a result of the merger b etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison is known mostly for its strong nuclear capabilities In fact Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry owning a total of reactors that produce about MW of power Exelon may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio Exelo n Power which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU ov ersees Exelons portfolio of coal natural gas oil landfill gas and hydr o generating assets which include intermediate and peaking units in Pen nsylvania and Maryland capable of producing MW of net generating cap acity Thus Exelons purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e ffort to diversify both regionally and from a powersource perspective fr om the companys previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast Perhaps equally important the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas market which represents the secondlargest energy market behind Californ ia offering a market value of about billion Now that California is n o longer a competitive energy market there are high hopes that Texas will prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state next week On Jan most customers of investorowned utilities in Te xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider REPth e company that provides their electricity As a whole the Texas energy mar ket represents MW of generation operating on a mile transmiss ion network One of Exelons main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as sets and position itself as one of the nations toptier energy suppliers Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon which up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago to Pennsylvania This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into the Texas market In the summer of Exelon began operating a new MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston Prior to that Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from two other plants in Texas MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and M W from the Wolf Hollow plant It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma rket especially on the wholesale side of the business and thus there are fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract Unde r the sales agreement Exelon Power Exelon Generations power plant operat ion arm will assume operation of the plants The transaction includes a to lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe r during summer months for the next five years at marketbased rates Consi dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement it is presumed that TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the summer months of the fiveyear contract and then purchasing the electric o utput of the plants during that time Interestingly TXU is able to abide b y Texas requirement that it not own and control more than percent withi n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants However realisti cally TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants at least in the summer months during its fiveyear contract with Exelon T his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas

Analysis News item from Associated Press In the wake of this years California pow er woes votes in the hometown of the states largest utility will decide o n Nov whether to initiate action to seize Pacific Gas Electric Cos l ocal electricity network and deliver power through a public agency Analysis There is a lot riding on todays vote and its outcome will undou btedly have significant ramifications for California and other cities acros s the country Although the municipalization of an incumbent utilitys elec tric system is not a new concepteither nationally or in this particular ca seSan Francisco is presently the largest city in which such efforts are be ing considered Given the relative success of other municipalized electric systems in California Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacram ento Municipal Utility District for instance along with the bad publicit y that Pacific Gas Electric Co has encountered over the last year due to the states energy crisis and its own bankruptcy proceedings todays vote could very well be a victory for public power The vote in and of itself w ill not create a municipalized electric system in San Francisco Pacific Ga s Electric Co has already vowed to fight the takeover and if the vote i s a win for public power it will only lead to further lengthy and costly co urt battles However the vote is significant because it illustrates what a ppears to be a growing trend among cities that believe they can provide che aper electric service than incumbent forprofit utilities In addition th e measure is just one more strike against the already beleaguered Pacific G as Electric Co which is still navigating through bankruptcy proceedings There are two measures related to the public power movement that are up for vote in San Francisco today First Proposition I would create a San Franc iscoBrisbane Municipal Utility District MUD an independent agency gover ned by a fivemember board that would provide electric service to San Franc isco and Brisbane Calif a smaller city located to the south of the Bay A rea California law requires that two separate cities be included in order for municipalization to take effect and thus from the onset of the municip alization discussions in this area San Francisco and Brisbane were grouped together as one district The second measure up for vote known as Proposit ion F would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and reta in ties to City Hall This measure would not create a MUD and therefore wou ld not need to include Brisbane to take effect The agency would be governe d by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the curre nt jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission An affirmative vote in either or both of the measures would not necessarily mean an immediate effort to take over Pacific Gas Electrics infrastruct ure In addition to the court appeals that would undoubtedly take place in the event of either measure being passed an elected board would have to su bsequently vote whether or not to seize the utilitys transmission and dist ribution lines If such a vote were approved the MUD could use eminent dom ain to take over the utilitys assets Ultimately at stake is a battle over Pacific Gas Electrics million c ustomers and its transmission system which has been appraised between million and billion the utility claims that its system is worth b illion Both sides have argued decidedly different platforms The promuni effort in San Francisco Brisbane has been led by Bruce Brugmann the pub lisher of the Bay Guardian newspaper and City Supervisors Angela Alioto and Tom Ammiano The proponents of the muni measure argue that a utility distr ict operating as a nonprofit public entity would be more beneficial to city residents than a dividendpaying division of a major energy firm It has b een repeatedly noted by the promuni forces that Pacific Gas Electric Co charges the thirdhighest electric rates in the United States In addition the proponents point to alreadyestablished municipalized districts in Ca lifornia such as LADWP and SMUD which they claim have protected customers from increasingly volatile prices for electricity The other tenets of the promuni argument are that public power would lead to better accountability to customers and more emphasis on renewable energy The movement against the muni effort is obviously led by Pacific Gas Elec tric Co but also includes officials from ATT and Pacific Telesis Group which together contributed about to the opposition effort Apparen tly local communications companies fear that a successful municipalization effort of Pacific Gas Electric Co would lead to similar takeover measur es in the phone industry The basic argument against the public power movem ent is that the plan is unrealistic Specifically opponents say the MUD f ormed by San Francisco and Brisbane would be illequipped to handle the com plex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas Electric has effectively managed for years and that a cityrun bureaucracy would not be able to co mpete with big league energy players In addition the new MUD would have t o purchase Pacific Gas Electrics transmission assets and also buy wholes ale power without the benefit of longterm contracts which represent two h efty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run It is true that the city of San Francisco owns the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir which powers street lights and city offices with hydropower However the reservoir is reportedly in great need for maintenance and may require addi tional capital for upgrades Thus in order to serve Pacific Gas Electric s million customers the MUD would have to buy most of its power on th e wholesale market This is actually one of several important points that may not have been tak en into full consideration by the promuni forces Alreadyestablished MUDs in California such as LADWP and SMUD and those in other states have alre ady established lucrative contracts to obtain federal power at cheap rates through There is a good chance that a San Francisco Brisbane MUD wo uld not have the same opportunity to secure the same rates at this juncture Thus without the benefit of longterm contracts the San Francisco Bri sbane MUD could be exposed to the volatile wholesale market or be forced to invest in the construction of expensive power plants Often such costs ge t overlooked when a city is planning to municipalize In fact it has been reported that the promuni side in this particular case did not conduct any feasibility study in advance of its campaign and thus could very well be unaware of these associated costs However S David Freeman who previousl y managed LADWP and was recently appointed chairman of the new California C onsumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority went on record stating that his organization could assist a public power agency in San Francisco b y selling it lowcost electricity produced by plants financed by the author ity As noted Pacific Gas Electric Co intends to fight the municipalization effort and in fact has fought in City Hall and in court for decades to der ail such efforts in San Francisco However in contrast with past battles the issue has become more intensely politicized over the last year as San F ranciscans faced rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas Electric Co went bank rupt The utility recently received cash support from its parent PGE Corp which reportedly spent about million in an advertising campaign urging citizens to vote against the public power initiative This financial suppo rt has been helpful considering that Pacific Gas Electric Co is current ly in bankruptcy proceedings and has little capital to front its own defens e against the muni effort Consequently if voters pass the measures on Nov PGE Corp will undoubtedly launch a lengthy court battle that will ke ep the issue in litigation for years In addition to the court appeals it would most likely take the newly formed MUD years to gather the capital nee ded to front a purchase of Pacific Gas Electrics TD assets Nevertheless an affirmative vote on the muni issue could set a precedent f or future votes and perhaps mark the dawn of a new era for public power Ot her California cities such as San Diego San Jose and Davis are closely fol lowing the outcome in San Francisco as they have also debated the issue of municipalization In addition the Coachella Valley Association of Governme nts which includes the city of Palm Springs Calif began looking at the feasibility of taking over Southern California Edisons distribution system and forming a municipal utility last September In fact the municipalizat ion effort has gained some momentum across the country over the last few ye ars along with the opening of competitive markets through deregulation Cu rrent reports indicate that there are about public electric districts providing electric power to million customers and accounting for pe rcent of the demand in the United States It is important to note that the majority of these public power districts were formed in the early s The turnout for the vote in San Francisco could be a deciding factor Altho ugh the issue had been gaining momentum in the city earlier this year the events of Sept have turned the focus to more national events and made p eople wary of change Typically voter turnout in the area is around per cent A recent survey conducted by the opponents of the measure found that percent of those surveyed favored passage percent oppose it and percent were undecided It is important to note that municipalization is not an issue that is only facing California After several years of discussions lawsuits and negotia tions the city of Hermiston Ore voted to spend million to purchase t he facilities PacifiCorp has been using to serve commercial and resid ential customers The city of Hermiston began serving customers on Oct when a new contract with Bonneville Power Administration BPA took effect The federal powermarketing agency has already set aside MW for the cit y after determining that Hermiston qualified as a new small public utility eligible for preference power Hermiston Ore is the first city to complete a contested municipalization of an incumbent utilitys electric business in two decades the last signi ficant contested municipalization was completed in Massena NY in Despite the fact that a growing number of US cities have expressed inter est in municipalizing their electric systems for the most part such effort s remain overwhelmingly unsuccessful when taken to court or a public ballot Despite the success of Hermiston some other municipalization efforts have been terminated during the years between and For instanc e the city of Wichita Kansas spent more than in the past two ye ars studying municipal power options However after the Kansas Corporation Commission turned down Western Resources proposed rate hike this summer the city put municipalization plans on hold Thus the eyes of the industry will remain on the vote today in San Francisco for any indication that mun icipalization efforts are gaining momentum and proving successful TOMORROWS ISSUEALERT WILL INCLUDE THE OUTCOME OF THE MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE IN SAN

PR Newswire FirstEnergy Corp NYSE FE closed its merger with GPU Inc on Nov and announced that members of its Board of Directo rs had been named The effective date of the merger is Nov With todays closing of our merger we will begin operating as a larger stronge r company better positioned to provide significant benefits to our custome rs shareholders and employees said FirstEnergy Chief Executive Officer H Peter Burg Analysis When compared to and has turned out to be a rathe r anticlimatic year with regard to merger and acquisition activity in the energy industry In fact when compared to the early days of deregulation MA activity has slowed from a flood to a slow drip The days of combining two vertically integrated utility companies to gain scale and guarantee sur vival appear to be on the decline Partnerships will still continue of cou rse but they are now of a different breed than before and have become far more focused on a particular market niche One exception to the rather unev entful MA scoreboard this year is the justcompleted billion partners hip between FirstEnergy and GPU which reportedly will create an electric u tility serving million customers from Toledo Ohio to the New Jersey sh ore The two companies have positioned their partnership as creating the p remier supplier in a state region However while one of the few intere sting deals this year the FirstEnergy GPU partnership has not been witho ut controversy especially with regard to lingering financial obligations t hat GPU has in the Three Mile Island nuclear plant First lets establish the basics about this partnership Akron Ohiobased FirstEnergy has purchased Morristown NJbased GPU Inc paying a divide nd of a share that will be payable on Nov FirstEnergyitself a product of a merger between Ohio Edison and Centerior Inc is alrea dy an energy services holding company serving million customers within square miles of northern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania FirstEnergy also provides naturalgas service to approximately custo mers in the Midwest and is involved in the exploration and production of oi l and natural gas and the transmission and marketing of natural gas with resources that include proven reserves of billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas and oilabout percent natural gasand approximately miles of pipelines FirstEnergy also owns miles of transmission lin es with interconnections in electric systems and is a member of the Alliance RTO FirstEnergy has a market capitalization of billion a P E ratio of and its shares currently are priced at GPU Inc is an international provider of energyrelated infrastructure and services Domestically its three electric utility subsidiariesdoing busin ess as GPU Energyserve two million customers in Pennsylvania and New Jerse y Through the GPU International Group GPU develops owns and operates tra nsmission and distribution facilities overseas GPU has a market capitaliza tion of billion a PE ratio of and on its last day of trading Nov its shares were priced at From its inception the primary objective of this acquisition was to enable FirstEnergy to become the premier regional energy and related services pro vider in the northeastern quadrant of the United States A key part of this strategy is the expansion of the combined companys unregulated marketing opportunities including the acceleration of a retail business that FirstEn ergy gains by buying GPU After Nov FirstEnergy will begin operating as a registered holding comp any with seven electric utility operating companiesOhio Edison The Illumi nating Company Toledo Edison Metropolitan Edison Pennsylvania Electric Pennsylvania Power and Jersey Power Lightwhich reportedly will comprise the fourthlargest investorowned electric system in the United States ba sed on amount of customers As noted the combined company has billed itself as the premier supplier in a state region Those states are New York Pennsylvania New Jersey Delaware Maryland Virginia West Virginia Oh io Kentucky Indiana Michigan Illinois and Wisconsin However it is cl ear that among these states the combined company has already establish ed a particularly strong business in New Jersey Pennsylvania and Ohio whe re it will maintain a geographic presence of percent percent and percent respectively According to a presentation made by CEO Peter Burg earlier this year the a cquisition of GPU Inc will optimize FirstEnergys generation portfolio by among other things increasing its customer load and the utilization of its baseload units Prior to the acquisition FirstEnergy operated powe r plants with a total system capacity of nearly MW Out of this tota l generating capacity percent MW is produced using coal per cent MW comes from nuclear plants percent MW is fueled by natural gas or oil and percent MW comes from pumpedstorage hyd roelectric facilities Through the acquisition of GPU FirstEnergy reported ly will gain MW in peaking generation and the opportunity for over MW of capacity releases Company information indicates that FirstEnergy p roduced nearly million MWh of electricity over the last year As noted while the partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU is for the most part quite synergistic and has obtained its necessary regulatory approvals in a comparatively smooth fashion the deal has not been completely withou t controversy For instance a Pittsburghbased consumer group known as Cit izen Power has expressed concern that the partnership will ultimately prove harmful for consumers of the combined company Specifically the group cla ims that FirstEnergy customers have already been paying billion in stran ded costs and could be forced to pay for additional charges associated with GPUs partial ownership of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant Despite th e fact that the merger is now officially completed Citizen Power reportedl y has asked a Pennsylvania court to require state energy regulators in that state to reverse the approval of the merger One of the groups arguments is that the Pennsylvania PUC did not require either FirstEnergy or GPU to d emonstrate how the merger would benefit or otherwise impact the public and did not seek approval from the groups involved in GPUs restructuring agree ment with the state Other groups in Ohio have similar frustrations with th e PUC in that state and are concerned about any increases in FirstEnergy ra tes that may occur as a result of payments that GPU is still making toward Three Mile Island There is some public confusion surrounding GPUs holdings in Three Mile Isl and which can be easily clarified There are two nuclear units at the Thre e Mile Island TMI nuclear plant Units and In late GPU sold TM I to AmerGen Energy the joint venture between PECO Energy and British En ergy Co for million which was about onesixth of the book value for the unit The ownership of the plant known as TMI has remained with GPU In TMI was the site of the nations worst nuclear accident in whi ch nearly half the uranium core melted The TMI unit is essentially dead and has not functioned since However GPU has continued to keep the p lant in a state of monitored storage and has encountered some expenses r elated to staff etc which continue to monitor the unit The concern from some consumers whether it is valid or not is that FirstEnergy which now owns TMI due to its acquisition of GPU will be picking up any residual expenses related to this unit Specifically TMI is not scheduled to be d ecommissioned until at the earliest and there may be some cleanup cos ts associated with the decommissioning that may exceed current estimates It is important to note that GPU has very little of its own generation asse ts The company has followed a revised strategy over the last year that inc luded the exit of the merchant energy business and a clear focus on the tra nsmission and distribution sectors of the industry as well as new nonregu lated businesses Another pending acquisition of some remaining GPU assets involves UtiliCorps billion offer for Avon Energy Partners Holdings s ubsidiary the holding company for Midlands Electricity which reportedly i s the fourthlargest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom Th is deal should move forward although it was contingent on the completion o f FirstEnergys acquisition of GPU FirstEnergy had previously established that it had no interest in retaining GPUs international assets which incl ude small holdings in Great Britain Australia and South America In additi on the offer makes sense for FirstEnergy because it provides the company with available capital to pay down acquisition debt and possibly fund addit ional acquisitions Moreover FirstEnergy executives believe any possible negatives in its acqu isition of GPU are outweighed by the positives Again the fundamental bene fit of the FirstEnergy GPU partnership is that it should create one of th e leadingif not the leadingelectric providers in a stretch of territory f rom Ohio to New Jersey FirstEnergy gains significantly in the deal by acqu iring GPUs customer base and the ability to optimize its own existing and growing generation arsenal Plus FirstEnergy also gains GPUs remaining ge neration capacity which is rather minimal but does include about MW in peaking generation From a broad perspective FirstEnergy and GPU have f ollowed through with a rather smooth merger process which certainly repres ents an atypical development against a landscape of terminated consolidated deals this year UPDATE ON SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE See the IssueAlert issuealertarticleaspidDfor a full des cription of Measures F and I that appeared on the ballot in San Francisco a nd Brisbane Calif in yesterdays election Both measures related to muni cipalizing the electric system currently owned by Pacific Gas Electric Co According to data obtained from the San Francisco Department of Elections as of early morning on Nov voter turnout in the area was percent Measure F which would create a Municipal Water Power Agency in San Fra ncisco only passed by a very slim margin of votes percent t o votes The passage of this measure will create a new agenc y in the city of San Francisco not a municipal utility district that will not include the city of Brisbane The agency will be governed by an electe d sevenmember board of directors and reportedly will replace the current j urisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission Measure I which would have created a Municipal Utility District MUD in b oth San Francisco and Brisbane did not pass However it was defeated by a very slim margin of votes percent to votes pe rcent It is not presently clear whether or not all of the absentee votes have bee n calculated in this election and thus there is a good chance that the abo ve tally may change in the next few days and could possibly alter the outco me of this election While Pacific Gas Electric Co put a positive spin on the election result s in a press release that is circulating today the fact of the matter is t hat this was a very close election While the city of Brisbane shot down th e idea of a MUD San Francisco is proceeding with a Municipal Water Power Agency which at some point may also attempt to seize the transmission and

and Muni Vote in San Fran cisco By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Todays column includes analysis on three separate news items EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge News item from Energy Info Source Online energy trading EnronOnline will merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp agreed to a billion takeover by Dynegy Inc The integration of the two p latforms will take about six to nine months Dynegy said In the meantime the two will continue to operate separately On both EnronOnline and Dynegy direct traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy respectively Analysis This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging in tegration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron Although the merger makes sense for both companies especially considering Enrons finan cial instability and its limited options at this juncture it must be ackno wledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures and the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task The companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading as ill ustrated by their independent electronic exchanges Although it will be int eresting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two separate customer accounts one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegy direct have in common is that they rely on principalbased transactions It is important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage when i t developed EnronOnline the first electronictrading exchange well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydire ct about a year later The latest available information indicates that Enro nOnline has recorded transactions that exceed billion in notional valu e Since its inception in November Dynegydirect has recorded bill ion in notional transactions Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnli ne led by electricity and natural gas but also including bandwidth and pa per EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange In other words in ever y transaction that takes place on EnronOnline Enron participates as either a buyer or a seller Dynegydirect was launched in October a year after EnronOnline became operational Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline although it is growing The exchange recorded nearly billion in transactions in the th ird quarter Like EnronOnline Dynegydirect is also principalbased In oth er words Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions either as a b uyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydir ect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the tel ephone It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved i n two different kinds of online trading The first is the proprietary one tomany format on Dynegydirect in which Dynegy participates in all transac tions as either a buyer or a seller The second venue is an anonymous many tomany format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation takes place on TradeSpark Dynegy had previously i nvested million in eSpeed the trading systems developer that created t he infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates As a whole the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a ma jor growth spurt A study conducted by AMR Research showed that energy trading exchanges existed in April This number grew to by Septe mber A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that online trading in wholesale markets increased percent from to The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to gro w leaping from a billion market in to a trillion market in Without question the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a market edge in many sectors of the energy industry including the online tr ading market SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan News item from Energy Info Source A federal judge on Nov refused to de lay a settlement between Southern California Edison SCE and state regulat ors designed to allow the utility to recover billion of its debts and to keep it from bankruptcy US District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying th e deal as requested by a consumer group would risk harming the states se condlargest utility its creditors and the public Judge Lew who approved the settlement on Oct called the arguments for a stay advanced by cons umer group The Utility Reform Network TURN repetitive and without meri t Analysis This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establish ing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California Two weeks a go a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SC E and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs for the next two years The th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN two weeks to argue against the settlement The settlement would help SCE the states secondlargest utility pay more than half of its estimated billion debt by continuing to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed last May The judges decision now has blocked any additional counter claim s by TURN at least on the current judicial level and it appears that SCE is free to move forward with its CPUCendorsed rescue plan It is important to note that the original settlement deal between SCE and t he state of California emerged out of negotiations that had taken place bet ween SCE and the CPUC in an effort to resolve previous litigation SCE had sued state regulators at the CPUC after they refused to allow the utility t o raise rates and recover billions of dollars it had spent buying power on behalf of customers at soaring prices in the wholesale market SCEs lawsui t argued that the regulators broke federal law and unconstitutionally took its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their el ectricity At the present time SCEs total debt is marked at about b illion in power procurementrelated liabilities due to state law that prohi bited it from recovering the high costs of wholesale electricity through re tail electric rates Under the agreement reached between SCE and the CPUC SCE would be allowed to pay down about billion of its back debt of billion In exchange for being protected from bankruptcy proceedings SCE agreed to a rate freeze and a promise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off SCEs rates were raised by approximat ely percent in and will remain frozen through unless the utili ty pays off its debts sooner In exchange SCE agreed it would use cash on hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pa y off its old debts pay no dividends on its common stock through or u ntil its back debts are fully paid and drop a lawsuit against state regula tors claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power From its perspecti ve officials at Edison International the parent company of SCE expressed confidence that the settlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate enough cash and gain financing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of to pay its debt to banks bondholders and power generators Tally of Absentee Ballots Changes San Francisco Municipalization Vote News item from Reuters Two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in San Francisco and unplugging utility Pacific Gas Electri c Co have gone down in defeat officials said on Nov Analysis The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov municipalization vote in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election As noted in a previous IssueAlert Proposition I which sought to set up a Mu nicipal Utility District in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane was def eated However originally it was believed that the separate measure known as Proposition F which would have established a Municipal Water and Power Agency in San Francisco alone had passed by a slim margin Upon counting t he absentee ballots the San Francisco Department of Elections announced th at this measure was defeated by a scant votes Obviously Pacific Gas Electric Co is quite pleased with the revised out come of this election In response to the finalized vote representatives f rom the utility said This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentime nt in favor of the takeover of PGEs distribution system in San Francisco There may be some validity to this statement considering that one could argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas Electric and the recent Cal ifornia energy crisis conditions could have favored a promunicipalization vote and yet the measure still failed However lets not forget that it was defeated by only votes which indicates that the issue regarding th e establishment of a public power system in the area is far from over The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be attributed to several factors First it must be acknowledged that PGE Corp the pa rent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas Electric spent about million on advertising to defeat the measure However arguably voters responded to cl aims by Pacific Gas Electric Co that the municipalization plan was unrea listic The utility claimed that a MUD Municipal Utility would be illequ ipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas E lectric has managed for years and that a cityrun bureaucracy would not be able to compete with big league energy players In addition the new MUD w ould have to purchase Pacific Gas Electrics transmission assets and also buy wholesale power without the benefit of longterm contracts which repr esent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at

Penetrate Floridas Whole sale Market By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters San Jose Califbased Calpine Corp NYSE CPN a nnounced that it has begun construction of its planned MW Osprey power plant in Auburndale Fla The plant known as the Osprey Energy Center is expected to begin commercial operation in late according to company s tatements Calpine said in June that it had received Floridas regulatory a pproval for the plant and that it was expected to cost million to bui ld Calpine also said that it is continuing to move forward with the prop osed MW Blue Heron Energy Center slated for Indian River County Fla Analysis With the onset of construction on this plant Calpine now reporte dly ranks as one of the few outofstate generating companies that has been able to penetrate Floridas wholesale power market Other companies such a s Enron have made similar attempts to begin construction on new plants or gain control over existing plants only to be blocked by community and reg ulatory resistance Calpine which now ranks as the largest builder of powe r plants in North America has gained entry into Florida by agreeing to sel l the output from the plant to one of Floridas existing utilities Neverth eless it is a concession that supports Calpines larger strategy for expan sion both within Florida and across the United States Along with the Ospr ey and Blue Heron facilities Calpine also plans to eventually build a MW million plant near Vero Beach Fla which certainly positions t he company as the leading outofstate generator in Floridas rather cloist ered wholesale market It is important to note that the Osprey Energy Center which will be a comb inedcycle natural gasfired facility will be the first power plant of it s kind to be built by an independent power producer IPP in Florida under the states stringent Power Plant Siting Act There are some fundamental as pects of Floridas billion electric market that should be established f or context First Florida represents the thirdlargest electric market in the United States in terms of consumption million megawatthours acco rding to the Energy Information Administration so deregulation of the sta te remains of great importance to many stakeholders However Florida has t aken a go slow approach toward electric competition and at this point t here is no plan to initiate retail competition in Florida Leaders of the s tate including Gov Jeb Bush have supported competition in the states wh olesale market in an effort to move cautiously toward total deregulation F loridas Energy Study Commission which is preparing the blueprint for competition in the state endorsed a plan to allow outofstate companies to enter Floridas wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe r to the states incumbent utilities However the Florida Supreme Court has banned outofstate companies from b uilding merchant plants in the state which would be free to sell power any where and are not subject to rate regulation by the states regulatory comm ission A good example of this is Enron which has attempted several times to build new generation facilities in the state A proposed plant in Pompan o Beach Fla was rejected amid strong community resistance Enron was giv en governmental approval to proceed with a peaking unit in Deerfield Beach Fla for which the company is still attempting to obtain air quality perm its According to Enron the Deerfield Beach plant was approved because it was classified as a peaking unit and will be allowed to generate only duri ng times of peak demand It is not known at this time if Enron will continu e with its plans to build this plant now that it is being acquired by Dyneg y Inc Southern Company has also moved into Florida its first expansion ou tside of its service area after receiving preliminary approval to build a MW naturalgas generation facility in Orlando Southern Company has agr eed to sell the total output from this plant in a year contract with the Orlando Utilities Commission Kissimmee Utility Authority and Florida Muni cipal Power Agency Nevertheless the important point is that Florida has been a notoriously di fficult state for outside generating companies to enter and obtain permissi on to build new generating facilities Florida law does allow outofstate companies to build peaker plants as long as they only operate in times of especially high demand when normal supplies are strained Some new plants a re small enough as to not need approval from the Florida Public Service Com mission although they still must obtain approval related to zoning laws an d air pollution permits One proposal under the plan has suggested eli minating the involvement of the governor and the State Cabinet in approving proposed plants and limiting the ability of local governments to block pr ojects There are two factors that enabled Calpine to gain approval to proceed with the Osprey plant First Calpine seemingly has signed a longterm contract to sell the output of the plant to Seminole Electric Cooperative under a l ongterm contract which meets the Supreme Court standard that outofstate generators cannot build merchant plants Second Seminole is a public util ity and outside of the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commissio n which presumably made it easier for Calpine to gain access into the stat e Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative headquart ered in Tampa Fla It provides bulk supplies of electricity and wholesale energy services to cooperatives located throughout peninsular Florida A s of December more than million business and residential consumer s in counties received electric service from Seminole and its members A ccording to information from Seminole the bulk of its generating reserves is provided through a year agreement with Calpine which runs through Additional terms of the contract were not disclosed The Osprey facility will be located next to Calpines existing MW cogen eration facility in Auburndale Fla where a new MW simplecycle peaki ng unit is also under construction and expected to come online next year R egarding the planned MW plant near Vero Beach Fla Calpine reportedl y has found buyers for about onehalf of the power it would produce from th e plant enough to obtain the necessary state permits This plant could be under construction by the end of next year Calpine also opened a Tampa off ice in to support its expansion in Florida and the Southeast which in dicates that the company intends to remain a major player in this region w hich has been comparatively slow to embrace electric deregulation Further Calpine participates in a group known as the Florida Partnership f or Affordable Competitive Electricity Florida PACE which has attempted t o persuade lawmakers in the state including Gov Jeb Bush to deregulate F loridas wholesale market One measure that would help to give the state a competitive kick start or so says the group would be to allow companies t o build new power plants and resell the electricity to retail power sellers such as Florida Power Light A final report from the Florida Energy commission which should address some of these issues is expected Dec Ironically public resistance to new power plants in Florida comes at a tim e when new reports suggest that the state faces an imminent power supply pr oblem According to representatives from the states Energy Study Comm ission Floridas electric reserve is significantly less than the percen t reserve that incumbent utilities have claimed exists In fact the commis sion has found that without extraordinary management techniques including power disruption Floridas reserve is percent It is important to note that the commission is not including interruptible loads in its reserve ca lculations If interruptible load is considered then Florida most likely d oes have a roughly percent electric reserve Thus Floridas policy of r equiring outofstate generators to sign longterm contracts with incumbent retailers could be considered a very prudent move as any new generation t hat gets developed in the state is committed to a retail provider reducing the possibility that power could be withheld to drive up market prices As a whole Calpine has a generation arsenal that includes some MW b aseload capacity of mostly natural gasfired and renewable geothermal resou rces In addition to the baseload generation Calpine also owns or controls about MW of peaking capacity that is presently in operation Peaking units generally operate in times of especially high demand when normal sup plies are strained As the leading builder of power plants in North America Calpine is one of a small number of generating companies that have banked on a steady increas e in demand across the United States along with the need to supply power d uring periods of peak demand Other companies competing against Calpine in this space include Reliant Energy Mirant Corp and Duke Energy which coll ectively have reportedly announced plans to build some MW of genera ting capacity over the next years Calpine specifically has acknowledged that it will buy steam engines from Siemens AG between and to build MW of generating capacity Many of these plans for new generating facilities were outlined over the la st year or two when the United States faced a wellpublicized energy crunc h Now the pendulum has swung back to leave many of the same companies wor ried about a possible energy glut in which they will have excess power that cannot be sold or sold at lowerthananticipated prices Certainly a la rge portion of the generation planned while supply was compromised and pric es were high will be canceled or delayed However as one example Calpine appears to be following through with an aggressive generation expansion str ategy One approach that might help Calpine to beat the odds against an ene rgy glut is that the company continues to build generation in markets that are projected to have continually increasing demand However from a broad perspective Calpine may find that as other companies continue with plans for generation facilities that may have progressed too far to be terminated the surplus of supply could have an impact on prices which could in turn impact the market as a whole An archive

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters Ontario Canadas plan to open its electricity mar ket to competition could happen earlier than the May target date but the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report a spo kesperson for the provinces energy minister said earlier this week Its opening Were just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead said Chris tine Smith a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy Science and Technolog y Ontarios government will make the decision regarding the start date for competition once the readiness report which documents the preparedness of all the agencies involved in the privatization process is completed and r eviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris Analysis The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario Canad as most populous province may actually be on the near horizon is a major development considering that deregulation in the region has been in the wo rksand has encountered several delayssince Shaken by the fiasco of direct access in California along with the sudden price spikes that occurr ed in Alberta Canadas only fully opened market officials in Ontario hav e been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in t his region However it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward with its deregulation plan despite concerns from some of the major players in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become a nother troubled experiment in electric deregulation Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario it is necessar y to establish some key points about Canada as a whole the province of Ont ario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White N orth From a national perspective electric deregulation in Canada is occur ring on a provincebyprovince basis much like the United States is deregu lating its market on a statebystate basis At this point only Alberta h as deregulated its electric market which occurred in January Beyond Ontario none of the other Canadian provinces British Columbia Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island Quebec Sas katchewan or Yukon have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating th eir electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a wait andsee perspective Part of this reticence toward deregulation among othe r Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally l ow energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nat ion are vast and rather isolated from each other thus making the issue of transmission interconnection a challenge Ontario is an exception to this general rule as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is interconnected with other provinces and the United States As noted Ontario is the most populous Canadian province the home to mi llion people with an average power usage of terrawatt hours a year and representing a billion electric market The three main utilities in On tario are Ontario Power Generation the former Crownowned utility that was formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate commercial companies in April and currently controls a total generatin g capacity of approximately MW Ottawa Hydro which is owned by the city of Ottawa and Toronto Hydro which was created as a result of the con vergence between six utility companies serving Toronto Toronto Hydro consi sts of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company but owns no generation of its own Of the three Ontario Power Generation has the market share in the province reportedly serving about percent o f Ontarios power market Deregulation of Ontarios naturalgas market took place in the late s Following plans that had been in the works since at least electric de regulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November a lthough it was postponed another months due to concerns from officials a fter witnessing the welldocumented problems in California Energy Minister Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Albertas experience with e lectric deregulation Competition in Albertas wholesale and retail power m arket began on Jan a time at which wholesale prices for natural g as were staggeringly high High demand and short supply in Alberta caused r ates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian govern ments Naturalgas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dram atically as elsewhere in North America but not before the Alberta governm ent was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sha rp increases Under Ontarios evolving deregulation plan retail markets will remain unde r the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board the provincial power regulator and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets Under th e retail system customers will have the option of arranging their electric ity purchases directly from suppliers at fixedprice contracts or having e nergy purchased for them by distribution companies agents brokers or mar keters at fluctuating prices Most reports indicate that Ontario is well po sitioned to open its market to competition at least from a supply perspect ive in fact Ontario government officials have claimed that the province h as adequate power supply fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy along with planned investments in new generation However other observers have c laimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is servi ng as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region Reports fro m earlier in indicated that Ontario will need an additional MW o f generation in addition to its existing capacity of MW to meet dema nd and only one MW plant had been officially announced In addition despite the assurances from the government some companies hav e claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board is fundamentally uncompetitive For instance one company that appears to have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgaryba sed TransCanada Pipelines Ltd Canadas largest naturalgas pipeline compa ny and a huge player in the countrys regulated marketplace One of the key criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario gove rnment is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontarios highquality generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation leav ing only undesirable plants on the auction block In other words even in a deregulated market Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the mark et share of generation in Ontario TransCanada claims that this approach wi ll diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new gene rating companies from entering the province TransCanada which has previou sly made acquisitions of naturalgas fired plants in Alberta and the northe astern United States does not think that the province will offer a very co mpetitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ont ario electric market Note that in midOctober Mirant Corp NYSE MIR an nounced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of t he gas marketing business of TransCanada making it the largest naturalgas marketer in Canada and the largest naturalgas exporter to the United Stat es Under the Ontario Energy Boards deregulation plan Ontario Power Generatio n must sell or lease MW of its nonnuclear power within months of the opening of the Ontario market Currently Ontario Power Generation owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Obviously the governmental mandate regarding the d ivestiture leaves the bulk of the provinces generating capacity under the control of Ontario Power Generation which is a major point of contention f or potential competitors It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wils on does not share TransCanadas perspective In fact a spokesperson for th e office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system and the gasfired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario both of which Onta rio Power Generation will be divesting represent very valuable assets that should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the d eregulated market Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only a bout opportunities in Ontarios electric market and the company already ha s rather extensive gaspipeline investments in the province Nevertheless enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets curren tly owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ont arios deregulated market Moreover Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market but a good number of concerns about the provinces plan for deregulation remain unresolved There is great anticipation for the report that is expected sh ortly from the Ontario Energy Board which may specifically address the div estiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies su ch as TransCanada Certainly there is great hope that no further delays of the deregulation start date in Ontario and that province officials either maintain or accelerate the May start Just as Canadian officials have closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States US co mpanies continue to monitor Canadas slow provincebyprovince progression toward competition As noted Mirant Corp already has gained a market edg e in the naturalgas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanad a Duke Energy Calpine Corp and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Can adian naturalgas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy Enc al Energy and Anderson Exploration respectively The next horizon for the Canadian energy market is electric deregulation and industry eyes remain o n Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta

Strategies of Both Compani es By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU has agreed to sell its MW coalfired West Burton power station near Retford Nottinghamshire England to London Electricity Group for GBP million US millio n In another transaction TXU also announced the sale of Eastern Electric ity its UK distribution business and its percent interest in seven the company that operates and maintains the distribution network to Lond on Electricity for GBP billion US billion London Electrici ty a distribution company that serves three million customers across Brita in is a subsidiary of Electricite de France EDF the stateowned and lar gest energy firm in France London Electricity already owns the other pe rcent of seven Analysis Its rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two ener gy companies involved in the transaction but that appears to be the case i n this deal between TXU and EDF Both companies are pursuing different stra tegies but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their respective niches in the European market The transfer of both TXUs gener ating station and the entire distribution business in the United Kingdom to the French conglomerate EDF should help both companies increase market sha re in their respective markets The divestiture enables TXU to obtain its g oal

solidifies the com panys position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its generation assets both through its London Electricity subsidiary Althou gh the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies one stu mbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingerin g frustration over EDFs expansion in other countries while the French mark et remains comparatively restricted Before moving on to the individual strategies of TXU and EDF lets establi sh what is included in the current transactions As noted the sale of the generation assets includes only the coalfired West Burton plant for which London Electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue gas desulphurization process The transaction also includes a longterm con tract for TXU to supply the station with coal TXU Europes distribution bu siness is actually the largest in the United Kingdom and includes the asse ts and wires that deliver electricity through a mile network in East Anglia and southeast England Both transactions must obtain regulatory app roval from the European Union and US regulators may review the sales as well Lets now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these t ransactions TXU Corp First it is important to note that the European expansion of Dallasbased TXU Corp is driven by the companys TXU Europe subsidiary TXUs divestitu re of its UK power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company h as been pursuing for over a year In a nutshell TXU Corp has sought to ga in billion from selling off nonstrategic assets owned by TXU Europe to support further growth of the companys core trading and merchant energy bu sinesses across the Continent In February TXU Europe announced the s ale of its gasfield assets in the North Sea to Consort Resources which wa s the first indication that the company was moving away from a hardasset s trategy TXU believes it only needs to have access to power supply through various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in Europ e Toward this end TXU Europe also recently announced the sale of its p ercent stake in Spains Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico In June TXU complet ed the divestiture of its MW Rugeley coalfired power station to Inte rnational Power In August TXU sold two gasfired power plants in Eastern England totaling MW to Centrica a British gas and home services supp lier for million Under the current sale of its UK assets TXU exits the regulated pipes an d wires business in the United Kingdom and gains available capital to suppo rt further growth in its trading business across the Continent Specificall y from both sales TXU reportedly will reach its total of billion in ava ilable financial resources and substantially exceed its previously establis hed GBP billion debtreduction target In other words proceeds from the sales reportedly will allow TXU to strengthen its financial position by red ucing debt and TXU says it expects to cut its net debttocapital ratio to percent by early However the sale of the distribution assets inc ludes a onetime writeoff of million that TXU is taking associated wi th transaction and debt restructuring The writeoff has caused TXU to redu ce its earnings by cents a share The company now expects to earn b etween to a share next year With the divestiture proceeds in hand TXU Europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading a market in which the company holds a topthree position throughout the Continent Further the asset sales ext ricates TXU from the distribution sector which it acknowledges is a busine ss that provides lower returns and declining profitability The bottom line for TXU in this and related sales is to recycle capital into the faster g rowing merchant energy business in the words of TXU Europes CEO enablin g the company to derive more than threefourths of its subsequent proceeds from this business It is important to note that TXU Europe includes genera ting trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy merchant operations TXU Europe will probably remain involved in Britains retail market where the company retains the powersupply contract to serv e million customers but the company is no longer interested in the dis tribution sector of this market Moreover it is clear that energy trading is now the core of TXUs European operations TXU Europe holds a trading volume of approximately GWh an d earlier in the parent company TXU Corp reported a percent jump i n its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading busin ess both in Europe and the United States TXU Europe still hopes to contro l physical assets in Europe as represented by its purchase this year of a percent state in Germanys Kiel utility which in terms of volumes and c ustomer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in Germany However it is clear that TXU is moving out of the UK power distribution market and its sights are more clearly focused on Continental Europe Upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the ne xt three years TXU shares fell about percent on Nov to close at In early morning trading on Nov TXU shares were priced at However Wall Street analysts indicate that the sales should increase TXU s longterm attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acqui sitions enabled by these sales Electricite de France As noted London Electricity is buying the generation and distribution asse ts from TXU but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by the Frenchgovernment owned Electricite de France Londons Electricitys parent company EDF which still maintains a practical monopoly status in F rance purchased London Electricity in for million British pounds billion from Entergy Corp Based on comments from EDF over the last year the company plans on expanding its products and services and investi ng in further strategic alliances to become a multienergy company In fact London Electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the companys strategy to consolidate its position within the United Kingdom Thus while the UK market no longer appears to be a core focus of TXU it obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a m arket share in Europe Upon completion of the transactions EDF London El ectricity will increase its share of the UK generation market to perc ent from percent and reduce the gap that currently exists between its market share of generation versus distribution in the United Kingdom Londo n Electricity already owns the Cottam power station a MW coalfired generating plant located near the West Burton plant However London Electr icity will still own far less generation capacity in the United Kingdom whe n compared to the market leaders Powergen which controls MW and In nogy which controls about MW Thus the true focus of these purchases by London Electricity may be on the distribution sector Upon completion of the transactions London Electrici ty will own Britains largest power distribution network and control about percent of the countrys distribution business Analysts have suggested that EDF overpaid for TXUs West Burton plant the buying price represented a percent premium over the plants book value but got a fair price fo r the distribution assets The point here may be that EDF was arguably will ing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock on distribution in the United Kingdom and is attempting to expand further b y gaining control over generation assets Representatives from London Elect ricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top five players in the United Kingdom and have a goal of gaining percent o f market share in the region London Electricity has been named as a conten der for the UK supply company Seaboard which current owner AEP plans to put for sale next year Seaboard serves around two million customers in Eng land in the towns of Kent Sussex and Surrey The involvement in EDF in this UK expansion has added a renewed spark to an old debate namely the growth of EDF into other European countries while competition in France remains comparatively restricted In other words ED F has been the target of intense criticism across Europe for the last sever al years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have a rgued that EDF has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely pro tecting its own turf For instance while Germany has opened percent of its power market to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and Au gust respectively While France remains rather blocked EDF has freel y admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in England Spain Ital y and possibly the United States This dichotomy may become a factor as th e current transactions with TXU fall under review of the European Union An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers

Analysis News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE shares fell sharply in ope ning trade on Nov after the humbled energy giant warned it could be for ced to pay by next week million in debt triggered by a credit downgrad e last week The shares were down or percent to just over in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange The stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the secondmost active stock on the NYSE As of early morning trading on Nov Enron shares were priced at reportedly their lowest level in nearly years Analysis To paraphrase Shakespeare Oh what a tangled web they weave whe n first they attempt to Wait I better stop When speaking about Enron I am not prepared to finish that sentence at least at this point Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks but at this junct ure an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigation has y et to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the p art of the Houston trader Enron itself has admitted that its financial rec ords from through the first half of should not be relied upon Nevertheless perception is reality and the perception currently in the ind ustry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following yea rs of skirting the truth While negative perception continues to cause dama ge to Enrons stock perhaps of more current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality We know Enron has just lowered its third quarter earnings faces a stiff payment of million due within a week in fact and has cast doubt over its Q earnings potential The question of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a material adverse change in the eyes of Dynegy which still aims to buy Enron but wi sely included an exit clause in its purchase contract The other question i s what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar A termi nated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enrons a lreadyweak credit standing and it is unknown how the company could recove r from another blow to its reputation As has been the case since the first of October the ongoing fall of Enron story is changing by the day For background on Dynegys proposed acquisi tion of Enron and Enrons financial problems that precipitated the proposa l please see my IssueAlert available at wwwscientechcomrci h In the intere st of time let me summarize what is happening at this moment Dynegy rode in as Enrons white knight and plopped down a billion offer a share to buy the company which at the time represented a steal of a price cons idering that Enron was priced at almost a share little more than a year ago To some extent this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga In other words the company had gone through a tumultuous year hit its r ock bottom but still planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy Inc its muchsmaller rival The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fa ct interrupt the nuptials between the two companies For starters on Monda y Nov Enron submitted its Q report to the SEC which was five day s late by the way In the report Enron dropped what have turned out to b e several bombshells First Enron disclosed that due to recent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moodys Standard Poors and Fi tch it has to pay off or refinance by Nov debt it owes to a third part y with which it has a partnership or face nearly billion in additional payments Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt Enron would not disclose who owns the note but we know that the limited partnership includes holdings in CEG Rio a Brazilian natural ga scompany that Enron had planned to sell to raise about million in cas h Note that just last week various credit services lowered Enrons senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned that further down grades may occur which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment Reportedly if Enron does not make the million payment by Nov inv estors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for a n amount equal to the note payable Enron is presently scrambling to establ ish a mutually acceptable amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent paymen t of million Enron said that any further drop in its credit rating mi ght necessitate further payments of billion to other partnerships the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Also in the new SEC filing Enron increased its Q loss by cents a s hare to cents Enron originally reported a Q loss of million but has now raised that figure to million As a minor bright side Enron d id increase reported earnings for the first nine months of by a penny to cents a share attributed to adjustments made after the quarters end However looking forward Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings Enron also claims that even still the numbers co ntained in the Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen the companys external auditor Thus further revision of the numbers could take place Interestingly there does not seem to be a big question about whether or no t Enron can pay the million debt obligation Enron apparently has secu red an additional billion in loans from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week In fact within the current SEC filing Enron says that i s has billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and n et collections Thus some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the million payment if it is unable to r enegotiate terms with lenders According to the SEC filing Enron also inte nds to sell off billion in noncore businesses that are performing belo w acceptable rates and would use the proceeds to pay off debts although t his money would probably not be immediately available Again however there is a perception element to this development that shou ld be noted Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past i n such a way as to keep them off the companys balance sheets Apparently this nondisclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addin g too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock As has been well documented Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inve stigation regarding potential conflictofissues involving its former CFO News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nervous about Enrons stock As I said the question of the hour is whether or not Enrons new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer As usual the answer all depends on who you ask Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enrons financial status to Enron Investors are rather mixed on the questi on Some say that the facts disclosed in the Q report do not dramaticall y change Enrons position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisi tion and that the current drop in Enrons stock is just a kneejerk respons e to the media hype surrounding the story Further those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money com ing in from various sources Thus it should have no trouble making the million payment From a broad perspective so one theory goes Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock pri ce and the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combined company as North Americas biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity In contrast other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agre ement was signed Enrons stock has fallen an additional percent whic h weakens the original acquisition agreement In addition if Enron follows through with the million payment next week or secures additional fina ncing to front this cost both options alter the companys financial positi on from when Dynegy made its original offer which could be construed as a material adverse change Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the c ompany that Dynegy agreed to purchase New reports indicate many energy tra ding companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the companys credit concerns Such companies are now particular ly reticent to sell power to Enron for nextday delivery What this means i n practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enrons ma rket share which could diminish the value in the trading market that had a ttracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place In addition Enrons oncestel lar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse altogether Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to hel p Enron out of its financial mess Of course under the acquisition agreeme nt Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate billion assetba cked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financ ial woes which will be followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco which owns percent of Dynegy However some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done an ything about Enrons diminishing ability to secure power on the open market Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron in a strategy known as sleeving The fact that Dynegy h as not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some observers th at it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron In addition Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov in state cour t in Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consi deration of other alternatives Enron said it will defend its decision in c ourt Moreover Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agr eement The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC investigat ion possible litigation against Enron balance sheet strengths and earnin gs forecasts Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enrons Q f iling with the SEC impact the companys balance sheet strengths and earning s forecasts so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to term inate the acquisition Clearly this pending deal hinges on the development s that will take place over the next few weeks Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and determin e if the oncegolden company still represents a great deal or if pursuing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg Facts Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN beat expectations in the third quarter repo rting that its earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to launc h its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Like wise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies En ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional genera ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint own erships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged i nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lead ership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic kly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten in to the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu cing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical

item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved Astoria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York Ci ty clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria Energy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa ration before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a p rivately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro blems that have been identified within this region Like California New Yo rk also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t o take their own toll on the stability of the market In other words trans mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York states siting boar d to proceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it sho uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government This could be easier said than done as other planned powe r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p lant construction The problems within the New York power market have been well documented Th e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years s ince a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states abil ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin g new plants in the state However at the same time environmental and com munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem app ears to be particularly acute in New York City A November report issu ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Investigati on of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people T hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffer ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Lon g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi ssion lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily residen tial it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added De mand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyefficient and envir onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area The company is a s ubsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy development company forme d in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit will be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdN ew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b e million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on th e local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energ ies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including c onservation

AEP Entergy Corp and Southern Company told by FERC to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactions News item from Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FER C voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market FERC commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads If youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said FERC Cha irman Pat Wood Analysis Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERCs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend This is a mammoth ruling on FERCs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions In addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations While FERC has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the California market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions RTO Further the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition The objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading Put into a nutshell FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions I nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved RTO must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices Columbus Ohiobased American Electric Power NYSE AEP Atlantabased Sou thern Company NYSE SO and New Orleansbased Entergy Corp NYSE ETR ha ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions Note that Mirant Corp a former subsidiary of Southern Company has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent The commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate Under FERCs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power This is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of FERCs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l evel There are some important exceptions to the ruling First FERC has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a FERCapproved RTO This is signific ant as I will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in FERCs new ruling In addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved In other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling However the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary Also note that the Western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June was not inclu ded in the new ruling The three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposal s to FERC outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer Specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems OASIS the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a hour period Moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces The new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third party The new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under FERCs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases Purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own The final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid For instance if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MWh the transact ion price would be MWh Assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm What this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers Some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers price Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all US sellers nationwide What this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets Reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power The investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide FERC with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred I made a previous reference to the big stick that FERC is carrying relate d to participation in RTOs Remember that a few months ago Chairman Wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market With this in mind note that only Southern Compan y Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following FERCs consolidation mandate regarding n ational RTOs so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out This must be particularly painful for Souther n Company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five years Interestingly Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling Breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets This issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their

Rules May Set Continental Standard By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters USowned EntergyKoch Trading NYSE EKT is boo sting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands After a successful start we plan to subst antially increase our volume of European power power options and weather t rading next year said Uday Narang managing director of European trading EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in Fr ance and Austria although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Net herlands Analysis The announcement from EntergyKoch Trading that it will significa ntly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique In fact a recent scan of announcements from US power firms tells a similar story Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to stren gthen its European operations in an effort to replicate its strong US e nergy trading platform in Europe TXU said that it expects sharply higher profits this year from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent For the first nine months of TXU reportedly traded terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in con tinental Europe mostly in Germany which compared to terawatt hours in all of Further still UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity the fourthlarg est regional electric utility in the United Kingdom which in addition to miles of electric distribution lines owns a MW power plant The unrelated announcements have a common denominator US power firms are pl unging into the European energy trading market in droves despite some inhe rent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric compe tition among some European countries A new model in the United Kingdom kn own as the new energy trading agreement NETA rules appear to be facilita ting more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard acr oss the Continent The appeal of Europes power market for US energy companies is perhaps ob vious According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year de mand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to b e built an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT i n Texas In addition like other developed areas of the world Europes en ergy consumption has grown over the last two years US power firms who p erhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country have expanded operations in Europe where electric privatization i s occurring on a countrybycountry basis Consequently the companies ment ioned above join Williams Enron Duke AEP and Mirant to name a few wh ich have established London trading offices Moreover many of the US power firms that expand into Europe start by acc umulating generation assets in the United Kingdom as represented by the Ut iliCorp and Dynegy announcements Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early s and completed the process in May after Norway but well ahead of ot her European countries However there is a more important reason why US energy firms may be drawn to UK power trading and that is related to th e areas unique rules for energy transactions which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules it is important to fi rst understand the context of the European market as a whole and the tradin g system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this ye ar The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition Toward this end the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches allowing endusers the right to select an alternative provi der giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power sup pliers transmission and distribution network otherwise known as thirdpar ty access and the introduction of energy trading which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market This last point is significant because some of the European countries have dismantled previo usly integrated stateowned utilities and mandated the divestiture of gene ration assets At the end of approximately percent of the European Union EU e lectricity market was open to competition Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries at least those that a re open That is the good news However the basic problem with this appro ach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the t ransition to a fully competitive marketplace and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables For instance Germany is fully privatized while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide thirdpa rty access to competitors In practice this often means that one country m ay have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neig hboring country may have not developed any standards at all The other prob lem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient which makes it difficult to transport power across borders As a result wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneo us and lacking in comprehensive trading standards The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for thirdparty acce ss to the national grids on the Continent While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved the U nited Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more ef ficient market because it offers one grid system one balancing and settlem ent code and one contract format However even the power trading market i n the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start Up until March of th is year the UK power market operated under a pool auction system Unde r that model generation companies offered electricity for sale which was then pooled into an auction system where dayahead bids were made and power was sold in halfhour increments The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive marke t for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight However the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for m arket manipulation Given the concerns with the pool format the United Kin gdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October which culminated in the NETA model that started this year The key tenets that ma ke NETA different from the previous pool model are Forwards and futures markets which allow participants to form power sale d eals using standardized contracts either ontheday or several years in adv ance as opposed to only dayahead bids More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers c an negotiate bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the Unite d Kingdom A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co operating in a role similar to an ISO which facilitates the var ious transactions to ensure reliability The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand rep resented by individual meters and the threat of strict penalties for part icipants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity In a nutshell NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power tradi ng in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming The system i mprovements have been successful and more international power firms appare ntly believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kin gdom due to the NETA rules Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a percent increase in the number of contracts traded a perce nt drop in wholesale prices and a sixfold increase in the variety of produ cts offered As of early summer about new participants had regist ered to participate under the NETA system as compared with about under the former model As noted many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the C ontinent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale m arkets to competition In addition to the UKs model there are several a ctive trading exchanges in Europe presently although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive The Nord Pool with about members organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures market s The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about members and operates a s pot market for electrical power Smaller European exchanges offering both spot and futures contracts include the Switzerland Exchange and Germanys Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt In the meantime I think we will conti nue to see additional US power firms expanding into the European trading market and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert

that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci IssueAlert I argu ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re sidential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp urt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa ny operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and t he companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another

Analysis Constellation Energys stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven yearsdown nearly percent in one day and down over percent si nce May But perhaps what is most important about

economic conditions as the main reasons fo r dropping its companyseparation plans The company said it would now focu s on using its single status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S tates What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co mes from being a single company What has changed in the last one year i s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants the reasons are simple and profound The world has changed Constellation Energy Chairman

agreem ent million which Goldman had previously put in the business and million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti nued Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau se the company to record a million special expense in the fourth quart er The company said that its splitup with Goldman Sachs was amicable Gol dmans relationship with Constellation started in the midnineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business In Goldman agreed it would take a percent stake in Constellations trading business when the state of Maryl and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa rate trading company Poindexter indicated that Goldman did

Allegheny is confi dent that its yearend earnings will be within its guidance range of to per share Despite the strong earnings Alleghenys stock price has dropped over pe rcent since May and over

on by a slowing economy and soften ing wholesale market prices Paul Patterson an energy analyst with ABN Amr o said there are common themes affecting the industry One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them And two is lower sto ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth AES Corp NYSEAES apparently agrees Its earnings fell for a second co nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s elling off assets AES Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable longterm c ontract generation business By placing generating capacity into longterm contracts a company is able to provide

Causes New State Federal Conflicts By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The federal government has reached a deal with a c oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo rnia under a million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state Construction on the socalled Path project which was announced by Ener gy Secretary Spencer Abraham will begin in the spring of and could be completed by as early as summer Analysis The California energy crisis which clearly subsided over the sum mer of due to new generation that came online in the state mild weath er patterns and conservation efforts is generally considered the result of a severe supply demand imbalance While this may be true what often get s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the statethe lines that actually transport power from point A to point Balso played a primar y role in creating the tremendous instability of Californias energy market This problem still persists today and as California heads into the winte r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing The Dep artment of Energy DOE has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to Californias main transmission line While this is a positive step the upgrade creates a new level of state federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th e hands of private companies which creates a whole new set of potential co nflicts Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path upgrade there a re some things that we know for sure First Path which is owned by Pac ific Gas Electric Co is a mile highvoltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif ornia During the peak of the energy crisis in California Path became r ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks points at which transmission c ould not transport high volumes of power This preempted any transport of power from Southern California and Arizona and Mexico to the north whic h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor nia cities As noted these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand which is obviously a concern as w inter approaches The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat es energy market Ironically power supply is no longer seen as an imminen t problem New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou ld have operating reserves of between and MW this winter which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season However the report on the states transmission system is n ot as positive If the Northwest continues to experience a drought then No rthern California will still need to import more power from the south Heav y dependence on the strained Path could once again cause reliability pro blems for California Thus deficiencies along Path can be seen as a symptom of larger problem s that continue to plague California and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months if not years In fact there is a history here that is worth noting especially as it relates to f ederal state jurisdiction When President Bush released his national ener gy plan in April of this year he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path Following through with this order Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo nses from companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path The current contract which will add a new line to the existing Path is the result of that previous directive At present it appears that PGE Corp NYSE PCG the parent of Pacific G as Electric Co and six other companies have signed on to financially su pport the upgrade The six other companies that will spearhead the project are the Transmission Agency of Northern California TransElect Inc Kind er Morgan Power Co PGE National Energy Group Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA a federal ag ency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in wester n states and operates miles of transmission lines Presently Path connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t he states largest generation facilitiesPacific Gas Electric Cos Diabl o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energys Morro Bay naturalgas power pla nt The upgrade will reportedly include a new kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about MW from these two plants Further when t he upgrade is finished in Path should be able to carry a total of MW of power Of course the first question that I asked was Who is going to pay for the upgrade The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line The rema ining percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade The exact percentages of i nvestment and ownership have yet to be defined but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next days You may ask why these comp anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California Th e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr ough fees charged to use the new transmission line This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project who presumably ant icipate that California will remain a highdemand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported As I mentioned there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th is upgrade plan First there is the issue of potential state federal reg ulatory conflicts Presently state governments have jurisdiction over powe r line siting Thus the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path prior to Secretary A brahams call for privatecompany bids Specifically the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas Electric Co which it regulates to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path As seems to be a growing occurrence we may find that there is a state federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali fornia Gov Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t he states prerogative and have issued strong criticisms over the DOEs ve nture into this territory However in his energy plan President Bush seem ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca pacity If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE it is no t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area In any event representatives from TransElect one of the participating companie s have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state and public and private interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project Note that TransElect was the company that had unsuccessf ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California E dison earlier this year Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOEs upgrade plan for Path are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of Californias transmission grid The DOEsponsored upgrade u nlike the one that the CPUC has directed reportedly would not be subject t o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC Further bec ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n ew line these companies will be able to charge tolls to the power market ers that use the lines to transport power This is most likely a point of c ontention for California officials especially Gov Gray Davis who has sou ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p rivatecompany ownership of generation facilities in the state The positiv e side of this issue is that according to the DOE the bids from private c ontracts enable the upgrade of Path to proceed without any increase to either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am erica As a side note in addition to Path the CPUC is also proceeding with a n ew transmission line in Southern California known as the ValleyRainbow In terconnect transmission line Although the timetable has been delayed until San Diego Gas Electric is proceeding with a volt transmiss ion line that would connect Southern California Edisons Valley Substation near Romoland Calif with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo w Calif area just south of the RiversideSan Diego county line The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDGEs an d SCEs transmission systems The first interconnection is at the San Onofr e Substation near San Clemente Calif The project is designed to deliver a pproximately MW Moreover the expansion of Path is a necessary step to help California l ower its risk for further reliability problems Due to generation developme nt the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors The state government still has its hand in power purchases which represe nts a huge part of the states energy market The state has accrued b illion in debt to buy power for the states utilities the recovery for whi ch remains an unresolved issue While Gov Davis has preferred to increase the states role in Californias energy infrastructure this new DOEsponso red project on Path puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies An

By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Software company Caminus Corp Nasdaq CAMZ anno unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C orp Caminus said it would swap shares of its stock and pay milli on cash for Altras software business That values the deal at about mi llion based on Caminus closing price of on Oct Analysis The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry particularly impacting thos e companies that are involved in the trading sector On their own both com panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche Now that Caminus is acquiring Altras software suite which is primarily focused on the naturalgas trading sector the synergy between the two comp anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading Essentially Altra has two core businessesan energy tr ading exchange and a software business Caminus has entered into an agreeme nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio ns Together the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges Lets first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create U p to the point of this partnership Caminus and Altra were not considered d irectline competitors as Caminus business model focused on risk manageme nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions However there we re components of the companies businesses that certainly overlapped Camin us Corp has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline TradeSpark Ho ustonStreet etc Altras software which is used in the same energy tradin g portals focuses on naturalgas transactions Headquartered in New York Caminus which went public a year ago is a prov ider of software solutions and consulting services that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat ed with energy trading Toward that end the company offers two software pa ckages ZaiNet software solutions which enables energy organizations to effectiv ely trade and manage energy transactions ZaiNet has been designed to add ress a wide range of energy commodities traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and thirdparty s ystems Nucleus software systems which were designed specifically to meet the trad ing risk management scheduling and accounting needs of utilities genera ting companies power pools gas and oil producers processors pipelines and other energy market participants In other words the Caminus Nucleus s ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize track and manage thei r various energy transactions from generation to enduser delivery One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an d market positions in realtime and consequently determine acceptable risk levels Recently Caminus added the Storefront product which is a Webbased tradin g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet Also just t his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston Caminus unveiled a new so ftware product known as FrontOffice which gives traders of energy physica ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction According to company r eports approximately percent of Caminus revenue comes from software li cense sales In addition Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse s on risk management services for energy clients One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel y is its efforts along with other software companies to establish a commo n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra nsaction risk management systems A few months ago Caminus established t he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet and has since generat ed interest in some companies to participate and help create universal s tandards for energy trading One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro tocol for energy trading platforms The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions In September Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp w hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions Un der the partnership Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing transaction trading and risk management systems to create what they are calling a St raightThrough Processing STP environment for vertically integrated ener gy companies By comparison Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry Altra re portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d irect access load generation dispatch regional transmission organization RTO connectivity integrated OASIS reservations and North American Elect ric Reliability Council NERC checkout and billing Altra boasts a custome r list of about clients mostly in the gas sector but also including po wer and multifuel companies Altras software product suite includes trans action management tools known as Altra Gas Altra Power Altra Pipeline and Altra Web which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity According to Caminus the value of acquiring Altras software suite is to c reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga s and power traders Further the exchange of customers should benefit both companies Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s ervices to Altras customer base and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altras new generation of systems to Caminus customers The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp In fact Cam inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently explo ding According to Caminus CEO David Stoner the global market for wholesa le energy trading which consists of the European market is six to eight t imes the size of retail markets Consequently a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user In terestingly about to percent of the companies to which Caminus has p rovided risk management consulting services are US companies attempting t o expand in the European wholesale trading market Caminus consultants help ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA for the

valuable experience and depth Besides the UK Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy Spain Holland Belgium Germany and the Nordic countries through N ORDPOOL Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently when fallou t from the events of Sept began to impact the companys business For Q Caminus reported that its total revenues increased percent to million compared to million for Q Specifically revenues from the companys software license fees increased percent to milli on during the same quarter However for Q Caminus lost or cents a share on revenue of million due primarily to the fact so me license sales that were expected to close did not Specifically Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter Given the impact that the events of Sept ha d on many companies a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke d as scheduled Moving forward Caminus says that the addition of Altras software should r esult in an increase of its revenue guidance by about percent Cami nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its Q earnings to cents a share compared with a previous estimate of cents a share al though analysts are still projecting cents a share for the fourth quarte r Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions However with these opportunities come considerable risks Hence creating this balance between risk and opp ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a nd Altra operate However the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive Every month new competitors in this space emerge so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list However so me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam inus Altra are Allegro Development KWI and SolArc to name just a few Moreover competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state The whole sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret ail market and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol esale market before it reaches the end user Thus consolidation within the energytrading software space should continue and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings Clarification Statement to IssueAlert on Dynegy In its Q ea rnings statement Dynegy

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIntroduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corps CEO Chris Hamilos President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this morning at the th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque NM The st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career and reiterated his strong support for his son President George W Bush whom he affectionately refers to as as in rd president The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy However the former president did field questions from the audience regarding a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he faced in his administration and those that are presently challenging his son Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current presidents justreleased energy task plan a page report that outlines approximately steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia The former president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against Saddam Hussein who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world Further President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his presidency during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress that saw the big picture issues in a different light often made it difficult to find common ground The former president made only brief but rather significant references to his sons new energy policy Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney last evening former President Bush said he was aware that the new broadbased plan focused heavily on new supply along with secondary measures for conservation efforts This is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that if you want to lower energy prices you need to establish more supply In addition the former president offered that additional drilling efforts an element of the plan that has sparked a great deal of controversy has to happen if the nation is truly committed to increasing supply However former President Bush did suggest that the nation must be patient as it will take several years to see any significant decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new development efforts Meanwhile the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate As expected the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge easing of cleanair rules that should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit process for oil refinery expansion and construction These platforms have been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan However new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few days are raising the most eyebrows For instance the extent to which nuclear power factors into the administrations energy plan is perhaps greater than was previously anticipated Specifically the Bush plan proposes the extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of socalled breeder reactors which use spent nuclear fuel Breeder reactors although rather common in Europe and Japan have not been used in the United States since the s when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce nuclear weapongrade plutonium as a byproduct Other key elements of the plan include Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government which would supersede states rights to approve new transmission line capacity Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting and speeding up the relicensing requirements for nuclear plants Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury which are common byproducts of coalfired production In turn the Bush administration supports exploring new cleancoal technologies which should increase production by coalfired generating plants A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air Act which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power plants The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued As has been the case since the start of the new administration the continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts However the specific conservation proposals in the energy plan include providing consumers billion in tax credits through to encourage the purchase of highmileage gaselectric hybrid vehicles In addition President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to cogeneration plants which produce both heat and electricity Others including the current presidents father might argue that conservation efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as market forces high prices already are driving renewed conservation across the country Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that often thwarted his policy measures the current President Bush continues to buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy plan In fact just two days ago a group of House Democrats led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMiss outlined a plan that calls for increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan However Democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles Consequently the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and Democrats to support cooperation in Congress That cooperation may be necessary as Congress must approve President Bushs energy plan in order for it to take effect TOMORROW Summary of CIS Conference and analysis of key IT issues facing the energy

Albuquerque Complex IT Issues to Be Addressed By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEThe th annual CIS Conference began today in Albuquerque NM For the next three days I will be attending sessions and workshops at the conference interviewing key leaders of billing software and customer care management companies and gathering information about the new trends in technology and IT systems that changes in the energy industry are demanding Through the conference I will write each mornings IssueAlert from the conference floor so that if you are not physically at the conference you can still participate through virtual attendance I am particularly looking forward to the keynote presentation scheduled to be delivered on May by former President George Bush Coincidentally the former president will speak on the same day that his son current President George W Bush unveils his longawaited energy plan This should make for some interesting dialogue which I will be sure to pass along Some of you who are not directly involved in CIS customer information systems may question the importance of this rapidly changing part of the energy industry So let me provide a brief overview of how CIS serves as the foundation for much of nextgeneration business transactions in the evolving energy industry which also will indicate the kinds of issues that will be addressed at this weeks conference Although customer care meter reading and billing have always been fundamental parts of a utilitys operation deregulation has drastically changed the rules of the game First we have witnessed an influx of new energy providers which has raised the competitive bar considerably and companies that seek to manage what was once under the exclusive domain of the regulated utility meter reading billing systems remittance processing etc In addition the business model of the traditional utility has changed dramatically over the last years or so Many utilities have become more horizontally integrated meaning that they have established multiple entities to handle the unbundled services that they provide in new markets Not surprisingly the information systems that were employed under a regulated model are now rather insufficient to accommodate the needs of a deregulated market Yet at the same time utilities often do not know how to replace their existing data systems or have the time to do so Nevertheless an essential element to the utilitys or energy companys growth is a comprehensive billing software and customer management system Customers often demand online energy usage and billing data that is available on a basis In addition deregulation has allowed utilities and energy companies that previously operated in a narrow service territory to expand into new regions As these utilities and companies enter different markets they seek to eliminate various automated and manual processes required by vertically integrated systems that were required by legacy systems This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software that is available from many competing companies Much of the software that is now available is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The challenges that exist within the CIS space are many An energy company basically has two options with regard to billing customer care customer relationship management CRM The first option is for the energy company to purchase the billing software directly from a software provider and manage its own billing needs The second option is to completely outsource the entire billing customer care services to a company that will manage the entire service I have seen some reports indicating that up to percent of deployments of systems for customer relationship management fail Thus any decision that an energy company makes with regard to its CIS network constitutes a critical and expensive strategic step In addition the capability of an outsourced billing provider to handle the complex billing needs of a utility is still a concern Enlogix is the largest application service provider with over million end customers in production today Orcom is the second largest with over million live customers Peace Software and IBM Global Solutions just announced a deal to provide full customer management services for Xcel Energys million customers which represents the largest contract of its kind to date As the market for outsourced customer management in the utility industry is still rather nascent there are lingering concerns about how effectively utility customers will be migrated to a new software system Further the variances between commercial and industrial CI and residential billing are also a concern Therefore these two classes of customers typically are billed by different systems There are other challenges that the CIS industry faces including California and other states are causing legislative and regulatory bodies to reconsider deregulation which is providing uncertainty around the requirements and timing for such systems Multijurisdictional utilities are being faced with decisions on how to provide customer care that is regulated and raterecoverable in one state while being competitive and not recoverable in another state Public utility commissions are imposing codeofconduct rules that disallow the sharing of information across the various parts of the utility business in this case wires and retail This causes further complexity on how to bill these various customers The new deregulated world requires new functionality such as load profiling at the residential level load forecasting wholesaletoretail contracting and settlements that did not exist in the regulated world The CIS conference will offer the venue for stakeholders in this market to exchange information and engage in a dialogue on these and other challenges Various workshops will take place focusing on call center operations outsourcing versus Webbased CIS systems short and longterm billing strategies interfacing CRM and CIS meter reading advances and a technology forecast for the industry In addition more than vendors are expected to provide overviews of their service offerings at the conference The billing customer care market is arguably one of the most competitive and complex businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation Yet it is certain that this market will only become more complex and competitive as deregulation continues to unfold in the United States and internationally Hopefully this weeks CIS conference will provide valuable insights into the direction in which this fundamental part of the energy industry is headed TOMORROW Overview of former

Industry Analysis IMAGEWith California struggling through yet another round of rolling blackouts this week and reportedly its thirtyninth issuance of a Stage emergency warning since January the Bush administration is putting the finishing touches on its muchawaited energy strategy A national energy plan which is the culmination of nearly three months of meetings by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to be announced by President Bush sometime next week Even before being released the plan is surrounded by controversy and criticism that the Bush administration remains too focused on longterm solutions and has not provided any immediate fixes to national energy problems that are most extremely illustrated by the power crisis in California Analysis As noted the Bush administration wont officially release its energy plan until next week However based on recent statements made by both the president and the vice president we already have a good indication of the broad strokes of the plan Since January it has been expected that President Bush will unveil an energy plan that strongly encourages exploration for domestic oil and natural gas The administrations position on conservation efforts and renewable energy as longterm solutions to the nations power needs is less clear as both Bush and Vice President Cheney have made rather inconsistent statements regarding these issues conservation in particular Yet perhaps the most controversial elements of the plan are the administrations expected positions on nuclear energy and the right of the federal government to usurp state authority and mandate the placement of new electric transmission power lines As noted for several months it has been anticipated that President Bush will allot more funding for exploration efforts than renewable energy or conservation efforts see my IssueAlert from for more information on this Despite the fact that this position has been intensely criticized it is important to note that the president has not indicated that these approaches will not have a role in his administrations strategy In fact recent word from the administration is that at least conservation will receive a major emphasis in the plan However at the same time the president has stated publicly that the nation cant conserve its way to energy independence Vice President Cheney echoed this sentiment by remarking that conservation is not a sufficient basis for a sound comprehensive energy policy In addition realistically renewable energy sources only account for about percent of the total energy supply Cheney claims that even if renewable sources were tripled over the next years they would only account for percent of the nations total energy mix Consequently although conservation and renewables will be included in the imminent energy plan the Bush administration is clearly focused on other solutions that it believes are more realistic We will have to wait until the plan is released to adequately assess the extent to which conservation and renewable energy will be supported by the Bush administration Perhaps more interesting at this time are two controversial components of the forthcoming energy plan that have emerged this week First a key element of the Bush administrations plan will be the expansion of energy infrastructures to deliver power across the nation Specifically it is becoming increasingly clear that the energy task force led by Vice President Cheney will recommend that Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham draw up legislation that allows for FERC to assume control over private property to accelerate the construction of transmission power lines The task force believes that the lack of transmission capacity is one of the key causal factors of the California energy shortage and concerns about power supply in other areas of the country In other words in addition to Californias instate power supply deficiency power from outside the state cannot be easily imported due to clogged infrastructure A deficient transmission system is also a major factor in potential power problems facing New York City this summer FERC already has what is known as eminent domain authority over the siting of naturalgas pipelines which typically are underground and therefore do not spark much public resistance The construction of new power lines however is a contentious issue New lines are often blocked due to the not in my backyard NIMBY syndrome In addition state governments presently regulate the construction of new transmission lines and have been reticent to relinquish this control to the federal government In addition many states view the eminent domain policy as an invasion of home rules and a violation of homeowners rights If as expected the Bush energy plan extends eminent domain to FERC for electric transmission lines then the commission would be given the authority to force private landowners to allow new power lines to be built on their land The government typically compensates property owners for the seizure of their land but this has not appeased state governments in their opposition to the rule Once the land is taken from private owners utilities and not the government would be given ownership of the land and allowed to build the new lines This is something that utilities as a group have requested for some time as presently they face multiple local and state regulatory obstacles whenever they seek to build new lines In interviews this week Cheney admitted that eminent domain would be addressed in the energy task plan but has not specified what the plan would propose However the vice president did acknowledge that the key issue to be addressed is whether or not the federal government should have the same authority on electrical lines as it already has on gas lines In the second controversial element of the forthcoming energy plan Cheney also revealed in recent interviews that nuclear power will factor in rather significantly to the task forces proposals On May in an exclusive interview with CNN Cheney said that the answers to the nations energy woes lie in increasing the supply of energy sources including giving nuclear power a fresh look Given the high prices of natural gas Cheney has argued that from an economic standpoint now is a good time for nuclear power to reemerge In addition in the CNN interview the vice president pointed to the fact that nuclear power is recognized as a safe technology that doesnt emit any carbon dioxide at all The only significant problem that Cheney sees with nuclear power is the nuclear waste piling up at reactors all over the country Consequently although the vice president supports an increase in the nations reliance on nuclear power he also supports the use of a national permanent repository that can be developed for nuclear waste Yucca Mountain located in Nevada is being tested as a suitable site for a spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste repository Experts throughout the world agree that the most feasible and safe method for disposing of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground Moreover when the Bush administrations energy plan is officially released next week it will be interesting to see the specific proposals that the Cheney task force offers In the meantime the plan is already generating a great deal of controversy as some Republicans worry about political fallout from the administrations previous reluctance to intervene and repair problems in California Constituents across the country increasingly are voicing concerns about pervasive power problems although California and New York appear to be the only two areas with real worries Given the growing sense of anxiety about the energy problems and its impact on the nations economy it is feared that the lack of any clear shortterm solutions will soon spark an intense round of fingerpointing that could impact future elections Rising gasoline prices and predictions for summer blackouts beyond California are only raising the heat on this redhot debate Cheney himself admits that the energy plan has become a political debate in addition to being a discussion about policy For months it was clear that the Bush administration and FERC preferred to let California solve its own problems But after months of rolling blackouts the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and projections for severe summer problems Californias problem has now become President Bushs problem The bottom line is that an enormous amount of political credibility is riding on the forthcoming energy plan in addition to the fact that the nation will be eagerly looking for the Bush administration to offer reliable solutions to the increasing power problems An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American

THE CIS CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK Next week I will be attending the th Annual CIS conference in Albuquerque NM On Wednesday Thursday and Friday I will be writing SCIENTECHs daily IssueAlert directly from the floor of the conference providing you with the latest news and analysis about emerging technologies in the energy industry Key issues to be addressed at the conference include CIS CRM activities billing strategies and billing software meter reading the application service provider ASP model and a technology forecast for the industry Each day at the conference I will select the most important issue of the day and provide you with the independent analysis that youve come to expect from IssueAlert So even if you cant attend the conference you can still participate in the dialogue and information exchange Will McNamara Peace Software announced that it will join with IBM Global Services to deliver largescale and advanced technology solutions to utility and retail energy companies operating in regulated and deregulated markets Using stateoftheart and proven approaches IBM Global Services and Peace Software will plan develop test and deliver customerspecific implementations of Peaces Energy suite Services will span the life cycle of an installation from rapid deployment through production site enhancement and maintenance Peace and IBM have secured a contract to provide full customer management services for Xcel Energy which expands upon a strategic alliance that has already existed between the utility and IBM Analysis Both Peace Software and IBM have been aggressively pursuing the same customer management space for some time The fact that the two companies have now come together to combine their unique skill sets establishes a strong competitive force in this fastgrowing arena which can include outsourced billing meter reading data collection customer care CRM and CIS systems IBM Global Services as an information technology services provider brings an operational and management capability for backoffice requirements In turn Peace Software provides a unique suite of billing and customer data software that many utilities are purchasing as they move from legacy systems to more flexible solutions As noted Peace Software and IBM Global Services immediately followed the announcement of their partnership with a new multimillion fiveyear contract with Minneapolis Minnbased Xcel Energy Under the contract the two companies will implement Peaces Energy suite to support Xcels million regulated and deregulated electricity and gas customers located in Western and Midwestern states In addition the Peace suite will be used to support Xcel Energys participation in Texas deregulation pilot program which begins in June The project will replace Xcel Energys mainframe and client server legacy system The implementation plan for Xcel Energy includes all customer management commodity billing and Internet components that are offered in the Peace Energy software The contract with Xcel expands upon an alreadyestablished alliance between IBM and the utility that dates back to IBM originally contracted with Public Service Co of Colorado an early predecessor to Xcel Energy Under the million year alliance IBM has provided datacenter operations and disaster recovery for Xcel Energy including networking help desk PC and LAN support distributed services support and application development and maintenance services Through the agreement Xcel Energy awarded IBM preferred provider status making IBM the vendor of choice for any IT products and services that the utility may need In this next phase of the partnership with Xcel IBM appears to be moving the focus on a mainframe and clientserver system to a packaged product for Peace Software This is a major step for Xcel as many utilities still retain internal control over their own applications and are reticent to outsource these functions to an outside company In addition this is a huge deal for Peace and IBM as they may be planning to eventually extend the platform beyond the partnership with Xcel In fact Xcel Energy is just the latest in a growing list of competitive utilities and energy companies that have outsourced or replaced their billing customer care needs In competitive markets a prerequisite for the continued growth of an energy company or utility is a comprehensive billing software system that can handle the complexities of an unbundled environment which is where the value of Peace Software comes in Most competitive retail providers realize that they must be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Further as competitive energy providers operate in different states it is important that they eliminate the different automated and manual processes that are common in legacy systems This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate backoffice functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software An energy company basically has two options with regard to billing customer care solutions The first option is for the energy company to purchase the billing software directly from a software provider such as Peace and manage its own billing needs The second option is to completely outsource the entire billing customer care services to a company such as IBM Global Services By joining forces Peace Software and IBM are anticipating that energy companies will be inclined to not only select the Peace software but also opt to use IBM Global Services implementation and management services Peaces Energy software which reportedly is being rapidly deployed in transitioning energy markets around the world is designed to provide several selfserve features including customer enrollment summary billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy suite was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in an integrated tool Peaces Energy Version software which was released in December is billed as the first ebusiness solution to integrate customer and commodity management The upgraded features of Energy Version include BC ecommerce functions an advanced thirdgeneration browser user interface BUI enhanced billing capabilities and expanded industrystandard support for the Oracle i database system The result of these technical improvements according to Peace is a capability to exploit the latest Web browser technologies to support and streamline large scale missioncritical customer service operations Further the Energy software is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another The Energy software can accommodate billing services around natural gas electricity water home security and home mortgaging The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing On its own Peace Software has become a dominant player in the energy billing software market offering its onestopshop billing tool to a variety of utilities and energy companies Peace boasts customers such as AEP MidAmerican Energy Enron BC Gas Dominion Retail Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services Peace has also entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy suite at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver The company is based in Miami and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utility market The company has used strategic partnerships as one method of growing its business Prior to this partnership with IBM Global Services Peace Software announced in early April an alliance with Exolink a provider of retail energy business process integration services Under this partnership Peace and Exolink are marketing a platform for energy retailers in both regulated and unregulated markets in which customer data can be shared in and out of multiple markets Peace also just signed a contract with Delinea a vertical services provider in which Delinea has licensed Peaces Energy software as a customer management application targeted at midsized utilities However the billing customer care market is arguably one of the most competitive businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation Consequently the list of competitors that Peace Software and IBM Global Services face grows literally every month I cannot list all of the competitors here but a few are worth mentioning as they have grown at a similar pace to Peace and IBM Such competitors include Alliance Data Systems ADS ConneXt Enlogix Excelergy Itrons MVPBS LODESTAR Orcom Solutions SCT Banner SPL Worldgroup and US Power Solutions Some of these companies offer just the software solution which is licensed to utilities or energy companies while others serve as the outsourced management company that implements the software package The partnership between Peace Software and IBM Global Services runs parallel to similar partnerships between ADS Excelergy and Enlogix SCT software Currently SCIENTECH is witnessing a trend away from large licenseonly agreements and into Strategic Sourcing agreements In the customer care field today Enlogix is the largest application service provider with over million end customers in production today Orcom is the second largest with over million live customers Realistically it will be about two years before Peace and IBM are able to fully migrate all of Xcels million customers to the Peace software However if this transition materializes it could represent the largest outsourced

IMAGE IMAGE May Williams in Agreement to Acquire Barrett Resources By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIMAGE Barrett Resources Corporation NYSE BRR announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with The Williams Companies Inc NYSE WMB for Williams to acquire all outstanding shares of Barrett in a transaction valued at approximately billion including the assumption of about million in debt The terms of the merger agreement which was approved by both companies boards of directors provides for Williams to promptly commence a firststep cash tender offer of per share for percent of the outstanding Barrett common stock followed by a secondstep merger with a fixed ratio of shares of Williams common stock for each remaining share of Barrett common stock Based on Williams closing price on May the stock portion of the transaction is valued at per share On this basis the transaction has a blended value of per share Analysis This is a major coup for Williams as it transforms the company into a naturalgas transporter and producer which should offer tremendous support to its already hugely successful power trading operation As the United States continues to face a naturalgas shortage Williams is wisely acquiring assets that will guarantee it a steady flow of naturalgas supply which the company estimates will contribute to nearly percent of its supply obligations Much like its competitor Calpine Corp which recently acquired naturalgas company Encal Energy Williams is shrewdly reshaping its business model to gain lucrative control over power supply in addition to its prominent positions as a power marketer and trader As has been widely publicized Williams has secured the acquisition of Barrett away from competing bidder Shell Oil Co a unit of AngloDutch powerhouse Royal Dutch Shell Group and the worlds secondlargest oil company behind Exxon Mobil Shell had been aggressively pursuing Barrett in a hostile takeover for months and had increased its bidding offer to a share as late as last week Barrett a relatively small naturalgas operation but one that owns valuable reserves in the Rocky Mountains resisted Shells advances for reasons that are not completely known and put itself back on the market last week Williams entered the picture and trumped Shells proposal with an offer to pay per share Some financial analysts have already claimed that Williams is overpaying for Barrett as the per share purchase price represents about a percent premium over the ashare price of Barretts stock before Shell made its original offer in March Shell appears to agree that the price Williams is paying is too high Once Williams made its offer Shell quickly bowed out of the bidding war stating that although it still wanted to partner with Barrett it was unwilling to pay an excessive price for the company So what makes Barrett so appealing to Williams Barrett an independent naturalgas and crude oil exploration and production company is in the business to locate and produce naturalgas supplies As naturalgas supplies have tightened Barretts profile in the industry has ascended which peaked Shells original interest Up to this point Williams has primarily operated as a trader and distributor and therefore has been subject to the volatility of the wholesale market and the scarcity of naturalgas supplies By controlling the commodity itself Williams will not only have a guaranteed flow of supply to fulfill its contracts but also will have more flexibility to sell its power in markets where it can charge the best price Most of Barretts exploration efforts are concentrated around the Rocky Mountains Colorado Wyoming and southeastern Kansas which offers good proximity to the powerstarved and highgrowth Western states Further Barrett represents a strong company with a market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of compared to Williams market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of The benefit to Williams is clear At the very least the acquisition of Barrett more than doubles Williams naturalgas reserves Presently Williams controls about trillion cubic feet of natural gas mostly in Colorado New Mexico and Wyoming and has established a strong presence on the delivery side of the naturalgas business Williams produces about MW of electricity per year but has established a goal of producing about MW within the next few years Already this business model has paid off nicely for Williams which reported million in marketing and trading revenue for yearend more than doubling revenue from For Q Williams overall profit increased to million up from million in Q The acquisition of Barrett provides Williams with about trillion cubic feet of gas reserves which can be added to Williams transportation and trading operation In other words Williams will gain a secure stream of a commodity that is currently in short supply and prone to redhot prices In terms of reserves Williams reportedly will become the tenth largest naturalgas company in the United States Further as naturalgas supplies in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico traditionally good source locations appear to be diminishing Williams gains assets in the Rocky Mountain region where naturalgas exploration is flourishing As noted Calpine Corp NYSE CPNwhich has a rather parallel business model to Williams at least on the trading sidealso is leading the trend toward naturalgas consolidation Just last week Calpine announced a partnership with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners NYSE KMI to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline a mile highpressure interstate naturalgas pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in California This announcement followed Calpines acquisition earlier this year of Torontos Encal Energy whose assets currently produce approximately million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day and can access about one trillion cubic feet of proven and probable gas resources Williams has a similar project in Florida where it has partnered with Duke Energy to jointly purchase the Coastal Corporations percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project The Gulfstream project is a proposed mile steel pipeline designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida As a side note Shells loss of Barrett must be particularly painful for the international oil titan as it is the second failed acquisition that the company has experienced within the past few weeks Shell also lost a bid for Australias Woodside Petroleum for which it offered billion when the Australian government blocked the deal due to national interest concerns Shell certainly had the economic resources to make a higher bid for Barrett but the company has steadfastly maintained its principle of not making what it deems as overpayments for prospective companies In addition Williams strong stock and strong profits value also supported the purchase of Barrett despite the fact that by comparison Williams is a much smaller company than Shell Oil For its part Shell says that it will continue to seek other acquisitions that strengthen and diversify its assets portfolio outside its existing core areas Williams stock fell about more than percent upon word of the acquisition which is not surprising since it is attempting to purchase a larger company at a very high premium Barrett shares jumped about to As of midmorning trading on May Williams shares were priced at while Barrett shares were priced at In order to close the acquisition Williams needs to receive approval from antitrust regulators and shareholders However both companies remain confident that they can close the acquisition in to days To protect its stock which apparently played a factor in its ability to support the acquisition of Barrett Williams reportedly is including a breakup fee in the purchase contract which would be applied in the event that Williams eventually loses Barrett to another company

approached Calif Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal now made public that offered monetary concessions if the state drops lawsuits and investigations into the companys alleged price gouging Duke made the offer in a secret page letter sent in April to Gov Davis office which the governor confirmed on May Davis spokesman called the letter Dukes wish list which included having the state call off investigations of the North Carolinabased generator Although Gov Davis has acknowledged receipt of the proposal he has not officially accepted or rejected the offer Analysis Dukes desire to make a settlement with the state of California stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March At that time FERC put California power sellers including Duke on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification for their prices Duke is considered to be one of four companies along with Dynegy Reliant and Williams that faces the biggest potential refunds to the state of California In fact Duke reportedly faces potential refunds of up to million for the power that it has sold to California since the start of this year We can fast forward from FERCs investigation to Dukes good faith settlement offer that now sits before Gov Gray Davis The plan sets out specific action steps for new generation conservation programs electric and gas infrastructure improvements regional transmission frameworks and environmental goals In addition Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement agreement for which the California government would agree to cease all ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company Dukes appropriate payment is based on fair estimate of the companys alleged overcharges for power that it sold to the state Yet beyond the spin control surrounding this offer Dukes proposal amounts to a mutual backscratching agreement with Duke clearly obtaining the largest benefit Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke made by the governor and others In return Duke will refund to the state some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping the state with its power supply needs However under the offer Duke will admit no wrongdoing Rather the companys proposal is being presented as an altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of Californias flawed market Neither Duke nor Gov Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Dukes settlement offer but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction of the million that the state wants Other specifics within Dukes proposal that are important to note include the companys commitment to work with the state to get MW of additional peaking capacity ready for summer In addition Duke has offered to enter into longterm contracts with the state on reasonable terms and also attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Dukes pledge to share the financial pain of Californias troubled market with other market participants Presently Duke supplies about percent of Californias power needs the majority of which is based on longterm contracts This is a significant point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market in contrast to many of the other power suppliers under FERCs investigation The company also owns the Moss Landing plant located south of San Jose Calif which it is upgrading with a million investment Duke has established that the plant should be able to provide approximately percent of Californias new generation in While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits the companys total wholesale profits soared percent to million for yearend For the year Dukes California power plants generated percent more electricity than they did in In addition in the plants provided million megawatt hours of electricity to the states power grid versus million the previous year Further in January and February Duke charged more for power through credit premiums which were levied because of the risk of nonpayment associated with Californias financially struggling utilities Duke claims that it is still owed about million by the Department of Water Resources Californias power purchaser Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California On May Tulsabased Williams Co also one of the top four companies reportedly owing the most to California announced that it has agreed to pay million to the California ISO to end FERCs investigation into whether the companys plants were kept offline to drive up prices For several months FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the companys alleged shutdown of two power generation units owned by AES which reportedly allowed Williams to sell power from other units at higher prices The stipulation and consent agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties In other words Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing or price manipulation A Williams spokesperson has said that the million will be deducted from the million that Williams is still owed for power sales to the California ISO and the California PX Much like Duke Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year For yearend the company reported unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for In addition the company reported Q unaudited results that were more than double that of Q million or cents per share compared with a restated million or cents per share Moreover the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made from power sales to the state However one benefit of the deals is that they would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation Yet at least as of this writing Gov Davis remains less than enthused about Dukes offer and has not eased off from his accusation that Duke along with the other power generators has bilked millions of dollars from California consumers In fact although the governor has said that he is willing to continue negotiations with the various power generators he has also vowed not to call off the dogs in the state and federal investigation of any price gouging Toward that end the states lieutenant governor has initiated a classaction suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other power generators accused of price fixing This legal claim follows similar suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego All of the suits basically claim the same thing that Duke and four other power generators engaged in unlawful trading practicessuch as shutting down plantsto drive up market prices in California Duke of course maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied Nevertheless Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the companys part could eventually be determined The stakes have also been raised with some California attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price gouging should face civil and criminal penalties which could include incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the price manipulation to take place Consequently despite Dukes offer and any other proposals that subsequently come from power generators it appears that litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Source According to a new report from Energy Info Source the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has begun to articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs With several approvals a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO application FERC is shaping RTO participation among investorowned utilities Analysis The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO applications based on decisions that the commission has made up to this point According to Energy Info Source FERC has concentrated its efforts on the Southeast and Western regions Within the Southeast FERC has essentially rejected Southern Companys SeTrans Gridco while conditionally approving GridSouth and Grid Florida In the West the RTO West applicationwhich represents an alliance among nine utilitiesappears to have received FERCs favor and is the preeminent leader among nonISO RTO participation efforts However despite these established trends FERC still remains at odds with many of the leading transmission owners in the nation which foresee a potential conflict between the commissions rulemaking on transmission rates and its potential impact on retail rates which are regulated by individual states For background an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission systems within a particular region The origins of FERCs RTO policy dates back to its December Order in which it strongly encouraged all transmissionowning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO by Oct with actual membership established by December of this year FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received and its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members of the commission hold Over the last year or two FERC has engaged in an ongoing debate between its preference for transco forprofit models for RTOs as opposed to independent system operators nonprofit Chairman Curt Heacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model while other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs However moving forward it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate including the limit of one entity per region As noted FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the Southeast and Western regions In addition to the obvious need to establish stability in the West another explanation for the commissions dual focus is that other regions in the United States namely the Midwest and the Northeast already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO FERC may be focusing on the West and Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established an acceptable level of market independence The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending before FERC The RTO West which FERC has referred to as the anchor of the region has been generally accepted as a broad concept RTO West includes nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest Avista Bonneville Power Administration BPA Idaho Power Montana Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power BPA is by far the largest of the RTO West members controlling about percent of the transmission system in the region For the most part RTO West is an ISO although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella The second western RTO is Desert Star which includes utilities that are located in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas The third proposed RTO for the Western region is the California ISO which has been operational since April and wishes to remain a standalone entity FERCs main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its desire for one RTO in the area instead of three The primary rationale for this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be more easily managed than multiple entities In addition gaming by power generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs which would require additional market rules to control the gaming FERCs general approach has been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed The California ISO has tweaked the commissions patience in particular as this solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join other entities The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps in California whenever reserves fall below percent This has been something that the state has long requested but the price caps come with the condition that California must file an application by June to enter into an RTO with other Western states Otherwise the price caps will be lifted California is currently contesting this condition Under the leadership of Chairman Heacutebert it is clearly FERCs goal to establish only one RTO for the entire Western region which puts the federal agency at odds with the California government once again The Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares Heacuteberts belief that one regional RTO is the best strategy for the West but also has said that proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the new organization up and running Other western governors have stood in unity that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being Across the country there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the Southeast For instance Chairman Heacuteberts preference for minimal RTOs within one region appears to be a national viewpoint Yet there are unique questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in the West The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida RTOwhich includes Florida Power Light Florida Power Corp and Tampa Electricand GridSouth RTO which includes Progress Energy Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas However FERC rejected Southern Companys SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies other than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy The commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo but told Southern Company not to reapply and to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO In addition FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over control of their generation assets The rejection and conditional approval from FERC which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth have been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in the region should join the alreadyapproved entities In fact FERC reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority Santee Cooper and SeTrans GridCo so that they might also join Some reports indicate that because the Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model such as the one in California FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with its own longterm goals which include a single RTO for the area Nevertheless despite receiving approval from FERC GridSouth is taking issue with two aspects of the commissions approval First GridSouth questions FERCs jurisdiction over bundled retail service and specifically wants the commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled transmission rates GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates including the charge for transmission service under FERC jurisdiction which would allow the commission to change the rates in the future FERCs Order which essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States clearly states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would agree to GridSouths interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled transmission rates Despite these isolated disputes the formation of RTOs across the United States appears to be coming together While the industry awaits for further FERC action on pending RTO applications it is clear that certain trends are emerging FERCs longstanding preference for the transco model over the ISO model appears to be diminishing as evidenced by the commissions approval of RTO West and apparent support of nonprofit operations such as the New York ISO and the Midwest ISO Rather FERC has demonstrated a more primary preference for solitary RTO entities within a region regardless of whether the entity operates as a transco or an ISO From a philosophical perspective establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple entities Further a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain intertie problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region However it will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in independent RTOs such as California to relinquish their autonomy and join forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding the operation of a transmission system An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence News item from AP Vice President Dick Cheney says the whole nation could face blackouts like those that have hit California unless it finds more oil natural gas coal and nuclear energy He also suggested federal initiatives to boost the use of hydroelectric dams and the construction of new nuclear power plants He called nuclear power a safe clean very plentiful energy source Although onefifth of the nations electricity is nucleargenerated the industry has not sought a government permit to build a new plant in more than years since before the accident at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island Analysis What a difference a new administration makes The Clinton administration was generally thought to be antinuclear and EPA lawsuits were initiated over coalfired emission violations Efficiency and load curtailment was stressed as the answer to any energy crisis Monday in Toronto Vice President Dick Cheney stressed that conservation while perhaps a sign of personal virtue does not make for sound or comprehensive policy Rather he supports a supplyside approach of constructing new fossil and nuclearfueled generation plants The main concerns with nuclear generation are of course safety and the handling of nuclear waste Supporters of nuclear energy however believe these risks are worth managing especially when compared to the longterm health risks and potential global climate impact of fossilfueled generation New nuclear generation designs are being developed that are expected to be inherently safer than predecessor designs There is an article running in todays Wall Street Journal exploring safer reactor designs for the nuclear power generation industry The article tells the story of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT professor Andrew Kadak challenging his students at MIT to design a nuclear reactor which doesnt produce carbon dioxide He told them it should be cheaper to build and simpler to operate than any constructed to date with no possibility of a meltdown The students must have done their research quite well as they returned with what is known as a pebblebed reactor A pebblebednuclear reactor is currently under development by a South African consortium being headed by South African utility Eskom and its South African partner the Industrial Development Corporation IDC To date Eskom and IDC have attracted two international investors in their Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR project One is British Nuclear Fuel BNFL and the other is better known to the United States as PECO or Exelon The PBMR works by using uranium elements pebbles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere about the size of a tennis ball In addition helium is used as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closedcyclegas turbine and generator So why is it safer than previous nuclear reactor designs According to PBMR the safety features are described as follows Representative of a new generation of advanced reactors the PBMR is characterized by a series of inherent safety properties differentiating it from other reactor types It is due to these characteristics that the PBMR do not require the typical nuclear safety systems to actively guard the plant for the duration of its operational life The use of graphite as fuel element claddingmoderator and core structural materialreflector means that a core melt situation can be ruled out because of the large difference existing between the normal average operating temperature degC and the maximum tolerable temperature degC To summarize the PBMR is a safer design because it utilizes fuel pebbles encased in graphite and makes use of helium as a coolant Supposedly this reduces the threat of a core meltdown to a theoretical zero Also distributed generation enthusiasts should warm to the fact that this design would be sized to produce about MW which is about percent of the output of a conventional nuclear or fossil fueldriven power station The modular approach makes it possible to build smaller nuclear power plants to serve local needs and to expand them as demand grows Nuclear waste has been an issue for some time now in the United States Yucca Mountain located in Nevada is being tested as a suitable site for a spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste repository Experts throughout the world agree that the most feasible and safe method for disposing of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground Based on this consensus the United States Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of that directs the Department of Energy DOE to find a site and characterize it If the site is found suitable and a license application is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC the DOE is to build and operate an underground disposal facility Yucca Mountain is the current site under investigation by the DOE How much waste are we talking about here The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States However if we take the range of estimates it would equate to a football field ranging from fifteen to twenty feet deep That estimate takes into account all high level nuclear waste generated in the United States since the start of a nuclear program in the s Compared to other hazardous materials the amount of nuclear waste generated per year is very small All of the nuclear plants in the US produce about tons of spent fuel a year whereas million tons of chemical waste are generated in the US per year According to an information source managed by the University of MissouriRolla American Nuclear Society Nuclear wastes are for the same power output some million times smaller in volume than the wastes from coal plants Highlevel nuclear wastes can be disposed of by diluting them with twice their own volume of neutral materials as they are changed into glass or ceramic form The reprocessed waste volume from a megawatt nuclear power plant would fit easily under a typical dining room table A coal plant of the same capacity megawatts produces some tons of waste per minute And not to bash coal Vice President Dick Cheney also informed the Toronto audience that the Bush Administration has budgeted an additional million for next year up from million this year to support development of cleaner coal technologies The United States has a tremendous coal reserve that clearly the current administration believes must be utilized to meet our growing energy demand So where does this lead us It appears that as the years go by technology is improving the environmental effects of our generation sources Natural gas is becoming more efficient coal is getting cleaner and nuclear is getting safer The Bush administration appears to be realizing that fuel diversity is a good thing for an energy policy An overreliance on any one type of fuel for power generation can cause problems in a crisis situation Is nuclear making a comeback in the US The signposts seem to be inferring that it is Just last week a California grassroots watchdog group proposed plugging nuclearpowered US Navy aircraft carriers into Californias power grid The power from two of three aircraft carriers now on the West Coast could provide enough energy to power a minimum of homes in the state Also the first demonstration PBMR unit is scheduled for commercial operation by Should the test prove successful and the NRC approve the design we could be seeing new nuclear reactors in the United States by An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

affecting deregulation both in New Mexico and across the country Read the questions Sterba was asked at wwwscientechcom IMAGE IMAGE April Are TBusinesses Superfluous for Trading Operations by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Power Finance Risk Vertically integrated power company Dynegy is likely to sell its electricity distribution business within the next few years to focus on its more profitable energy generation and tradin g activities predict analysts familiar with the company Anatol Feygin seni or equity analyst at JP Morgan in New York says a sale of Dynegys transmission and distribution assets could fetch the company close to billion Analysis There are two different ways to evaluate the speculation that Dynegy may be looking to sell its transmission and distribution TD business From a companyspecific perspective such a strategy would make sense for Dynegy as it would allow the company to focus more exclusively o n its trading and marketing operation which has experienced truly spectacula r growth over the last year Although Dynegy has refused to deny or confirm reports that it is planning to sell its Tassets the companys financ ial numbers clearly build a case for such a move In addition Dynegys potenti al restructuring could very well be part of a larger trend in which those companies that place a high priority on their generation business see littl e value in remaining in the highly regulated and lowprofit Tmarket To be clear Dynegys Tsubsidiary is Illinois Power based in Decatur Ill which serves more than naturalgas and electric utility customers i n a squaremile area across Illinois Dynegy acquired Illinois Power when it completed its merger with Illinova in February At the time Dynegy maintained that a primary value of the acquisition was Illinois Powers Toperations and the fact that they would allow Dynegy to gain a foothold in the Illinois market Of course Dynegy also gained approximatel y MW of generation that Illinois Power had previously structured in an unregulated subsidiary Nevertheless if Dynegy is planning to sell its Toperation the sale would include Illinois Power and would represent a dramatic strategy turnaround for the company Lets look at the unique reasons why Dynegy might be considering such a mov e Its rather apropos that word begins to circulate of a sale of the company s Tbusiness at the same time that Dynegy releases its Q report i n which its earnings more than doubled As it has in the past few quarters Dynegy reported remarkable numbers including a percent increase in its earning s that resulted primarily from wholesale natural gas and electricity sales Dynegys recurring net income in the first quarter rose to million o r cents per diluted share from million or cents in Q Firstquarter revenues rose to billion from billion Dynegy reportedly produced and sold million megawatt hours of electricity in Q which represented a percent increase over the same period in Dynegy continues to discount the role that California sales played in its earnings despite the fact that it owns about MW of capacity in the state including joint ventures Due to its presence in the state Dynegy along with a handful of other power suppliers continues to be singled out as having gained a financial windfall from the California energy crisis Ye t even without California cold weather in the Midwest during Q also benefited Dynegy along with other natural gas and power producers such as Enron and Duke Looking nationally Dynegy has ownership stakes in about MW of generating capacity and is on its way toward the goal of ownin g or controlling MW by Consequently it seems fairly clear that wholesale marketing and trading is where Dynegy is making most of its money It only makes sense that the company would want to invest its existing capital resources and any funds gained from selling its Tassets into growing this part of its busine ss In contrast in general Toperations typically only bring a return of equ ity of about percent given the fact that they are still heavily regulated by FERC When percent of its earnings are coming from wholesale operations it is a nobrainer that Dynegy would move further and further into this market Moving forward Dynegys business most likely will become more abou t managing its power sales and exchanges on its stillnew trading platform Dynegydirect and less about operating a distribution system As noted I think Dynegys business model fits into what appears to be a growing trend among companies heavily focused on generation and trading First over the last year there has been a slew of companies that have divided or are planning to divide their regulated and nonregulated businesses AEP UtiliCorp Southern Company Reliant and NRG to name a few The operations are being split not only to attract two different sets of investors but also to allow a highgrowth business such as independent power production or wholesale trading to grow independently from regulated operations Second I think we can look to AEP as a company that is charting what may become a more common path Last fall after completing its acquisition of CSW AEP announced an extensive corporate restructuring that includes an exclusive focus on generation assets wholesale marketing and trading The company has no plans to expand its distribution assets either domestically or internationally AEP has not released its Q earnings report yet b ut for yearend wholesale margins at the company were cents per share higher than in AEP presently controls a generation portfolio of MW and is a top power marketer and top natural gas trader in North America Nevertheless AEPs restructuring could take more than a year to accomplish especially considering that the company may have pooling of interests restrictions related to its merger with CSW and other conditions that fall under PUHCA Thus its evident why the power marketing and generation business is so appealing In addition it is also becoming clear that transmission and distribution businesses might be something to avoid unless a company only wants to remain in this heavily regulated side of the energy industry Ive already mentioned the low average return on equity associated with Toperations also referred to as wires businesses in some sta tes In addition FERC continues to monitor interstate transmission activity and oftentimes the policies affixed onto separate transmission systems can be divergent and extremely complicated A company that owns or operates Tassets especially ones that transcend regional boundaries may find that the business causes an excessive amount of operational headaches that simpl y cannot be justified by its minimal profit opportunities Siting is also a problem as even when communities can be convinced of the need for new Tcapacity they typically do not want it within their own view As a result the wires business is presently considered to be rather lethargic considering its low risk low rate of return characteristics According to Reuters electricity demand over the next years is expected to increase by to percent In contrast transmission line capacity is expected to increase by only about percent The reasons for this disparit y are that many companies are avoiding further investment in transmission capacity due to the inherent disadvantages associated with this business Further companies that presently own or operate transmission lines are impacted by FERC Order which mandates a plan for forming or joining a regional transmission organization RTO by Dec of this year While RTO plans continue to remain a high priority the siting or expansion of Tcapacity has become a secondary concern Considering these many downsides to the wires business Dynegy and other companies that look to sell their Tbusinesses may not have such an ea sy time with the divestiture As noted the business is heavily regulated and any potential sale would have to be approved by several layers of regulatory agencies In addition a company looking to purchase Tassets assumin g that the company is aware of all the risks involved would most likely be a company that is only interested in Tand is not an active participant in the generation business There are companies with this kind of business model National Grid comes t o mind as a leading example The UK company is one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies and for over a year has been attempting to establish a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the industry primarily in the United States National Grid has acquired Niagara Mohawk New England Electric System NEES and Eastern Utilities Associates EAU all Toperations located in the Northeastern United States Dynegys assets are located in the Midwest and do not seem consistent with National Grids regional focus However the point to be made is that there are companies active in the United States that are aggressively pursuing Toperations despite the seemingly obvious risks associated with this business An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

Energy Markets Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn said the states investorowned utility companies could fail in a month without a deferred energy rate increase mechanism Guinn said Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power could be moving toward bankruptcy in days if the Legislature fails to quickly approve deferred energy rate increases Withou t approval the utilities will have difficulty borrowing money to buy power o n the wholesale market and to buy natural gas for use in their own power plants the governor said Analysis The prognosis appears to be getting increasingly worse for Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP and its two utility subsidiaries Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power At issue at the present time is the company s ability to secure significant rate increases that will cover its growing costs for securing power on the wholesale market which reportedly reached million for yearend The timeline for a rate increase approval and the specific amount of the rate increase should be the deciding factor s that determine whether or not Sierra Pacific Resources becomes the next maj or utility operation to file bankruptcy Along with this new warning from Gov Guinn Sierra Pacific Resources boar d of directors also just announced that it will not pay the dividend that is historically paid on May The board cited continued uncertainty over how Nevada will resolve its energy crisis The companys CEO Walt Higgins acknowledged that the dividend is vitally important in retaining investor confidence in Nevada but also said that it is equally important that the dividend reflect the companys current financial condition The company typically has paid a quarterly dividend of cents and the suspension of paying this quarters dividend will save the company less than million In addition Sierra Pacific Resources is engaged in costcutting measures that are focused on reducing all expenses other than those associated with safety and customer service The various news surrounding Sierra Pacific Resources played a direct role in the sharp decline in the companys stock on April Shares of the company dropped or percent to This is down from a week high of and book value of I have been tracking the growing financial problems of Sierra Pacific Resources for several weeks For background information please reference m y IssueAlerts from and As a brief summary Sierra Pacific Resources has found itself in a similar predicament to that experienced by the California utilities which has led Pacific Gas Electric Co to bankruptcy court Essentially Sierra Pacific Resources reported a fourthquarter loss of million or cents a share as a result of soaring costs of power in the western United States The company incurre d losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in the volatile wholesale market The situation has grown increasing ly worse for the company over the last month Without some rate relief the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling our ability to serve the needs of our customers said Mark Ruelle the companys chief financial officer The company attributed the financial losses to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Sierra Pacific Resources already received an emergency rate increase of percent million on March Clearly that increase has not been deeme d sufficient by the company or the governor to pay down the reported billion in debt that the company currently carries In an effort to save Sierra Pacific Resources from financial insolvency Gov Guinn has proposed the use of deferred energy rate cases which the states Senate Commerce an d Labor Committee passed on April the full Senate must still approve the measure The motion is being attached as an amendment to the previously approved Assembly Bill which prohibited the pending sale of Sierra Pacific Resources power plants and essentially returned Nevada to a regulated market The Nevada Assembly has yet to approve the measure which has prompted Gov Guinns warnings about a possible bankruptcy for Sierra Pacific Resources The State Assembly is scheduled to review the amendment this week Up to this point the operating utilities of Sierra Pacific Resources have been raising rates on a monthly basis to accommodate wholesale power purchases that they must make to supply power to customers Essentially a deferred rate increase would allow Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power to recover any fuel and power purchase costs that exceed current rates Under the amendment the utilities increased cost of purchasing wholesale power and natural gas would be factored into the onceayear rate increase calle d deferred because it takes effect after the power purchases have been made rather than immediately The rate increases could also be spread out over three years to minimize impact on customers In other words customers woul d not be exposed to the anticipated high cost for power that is expected to occur this summer in Nevada but instead would incur the increases a year from now or possibly spread over a threeyear program The benefit for the utilities is that their creditworthiness would be maintained which would allow them to continue to buy wholesale power and support various other projects Lenders allow the utilities to use accounts for unrecovered cost increases as a security for loans because they expect the utilities will be able to collect the money later through deferred ener gy rate cases Sierra Pacific Resources officially supports the move toward deferred energy rate increases as opposed to monthly increases for two reasons Sierra Pacific Resources believes further rate increases are desperately needed and a onceayear rate increase would be less detrimental to the companys customers It has been estimated that the increase could be as much as million next year based on Sierra Pacifi c Resources projections that its power purchase costs could increase by kWh or about percent If the deferred rate increase method is approved Sierra Pacific would no longer receive monthly rate increases Also the company would be required to forfeit any unrecovered power costs that have not been recouped through monthly rate increases that have taken place to date which reportedly would save customers about million Further Sierra Pacific Resources has agreed to credit customers for the first month of collections that occurred with regard to the percent million rate increase that took effect March This reportedly should save customers an additional million rounding off total savings to approximately million After providing the customer credit for the one month Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power would continue to collect the additional percent until next year when their rates are formally adjuste d Another provision of the pending amendment stipulates that Sierra Pacific Resources cannot participate in a deferred energy rate case if it completes the proposed sale of Portland General to Enron by July a deal that has been troubled due to Sierra Pacific Resources financial problems Along with the volatility of the western wholesale markets Sierra Pacific Resources has also been financially impacted by the recent restriction against the sale of its power plants Assembly Bill to which the amendment regarding the deferred rate increases is being added blocks the sale of Nevada power plants before July Nevada utilities will be allowed to apply to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada for plant sal es that include a state of substantial financial emergency after July Nevada regulators passed the measure out of concern about the states existing power supply and whether or not outofstate companies would sell power from the plants back into the state The measure has impacted Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power because they were counting on receiving approximately billion from pending sales of their power plants There is a rather striking parallel between what is happening in Nevada and what has been well documented as the California energy crisis Interestingl y the California utilities began to experience their financial difficulties after deregulation had already been in effect for about two years The Neva da utilities are experiencing financial problems which are also related to th e costs of procuring wholesale power in advance of the start of deregulation Wisely Nevada regulators have postponed the start of competition until market stability can be achieved within the state Key to achieving this stability will be the financial solvency of Sierra Pacific Resources two operating utilities Whether or not bankruptcy proceedings in Nevada can be averted remains to be seen but the sole determining factor appears to lie in what the State Assembly will soon decide with regard to deferred energy rat e increases An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of

electricity company UtiliCorp United Inc NYSE UCU said that the price range for an initial public offering IPO it is planning rose to a new range of to a share from to an increase of about percent Aquila reported the increase in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC It still plans to offer million common shares to the public of which are being sold by Aquila and the other by UtiliCorp In raising the high end of the price range Aquila could raise up to million compared to a previous million Analysis Aquilas IPO which is scheduled to take place later this month is part of a major restructuring effort that is unfolding at UtiliCorp In addition to a recently completed merger with St Joseph Light Power Company UtiliCorp has been planning the spinoff of the highly successful Aquila subsidiary for some time The IPO will make Aquila a standalone publicly traded company that can attract its own set of investors along with allowing parent company UtiliCorp to continue attracting its own funding Aquila is scheduled to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ILA the week of April Based in Kansas City Aquila is a provider of risk management services and a leading wholesaler of electricity and natural gas in North America It also provides wholesale energy services in the United Kingdom and has a presence in Scandinavia Germany and Spain Aquila has about million customers across the United States and in Canada Great Britain New Zealand and Australia The company has been on an aggressive expansion mode for most of the last year In October Aquila announced plans to acquire GPUs wholly owned subsidiary GPU International for million The purchase includes six independent USbased generating plants and a development generation project representing about MW of capacity With that purchase Aquila will own or control more than MW of generation Parent company UtiliCorp had billion in assets at the end of and sales of billion Aquila has maintained that it plans to use proceeds earned from the IPO to repay debt to UtiliCorp as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes Aquila has said that it will not be receiving any of the money from the shares sold by UtiliCorp If the IPO is completed UtiliCorp will own approximately percent of Aquila Incs outstanding capital stock Aquilas pending IPO got a jumpstart recently when UtiliCorp announced that its firstquarter earnings would be to percent higher than last years comparable results UtiliCorp attributed the estimated rise in profits to the continued strong performance of Aquila Specifically UtiliCorp is expected to make cents per share in the first quarter compared to cents in last years prior period according to two analysts polled by First CallThomson Financial The motives for spinning off Aquila are fairly clear UtiliCorp follows a growing list of other companies Southern Company and Xcel Energy for example that have spun off highrisk or highgrowth businesses into standalone entities Aquilas anticipated IPO price range of to compares strongly to Southern Energys now Mirants IPO price of and NRGs IPO price of Spinning off a highrisk independent power producing subsidiary is a wise move as the end result will be two public companies with dramatically different risk reward profiles Traditional utility investors have tended to be fairly risk averse preferring to invest in the regulated activities of a conservative utility company As Aquila continues to penetrate new competitive markets it will now have the freedom to transform itself into an appealing investment opportunity for investors who are more growth oriented and tolerant of risk Consequently the most practical way to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for UtiliCorp to bifurcate its operations offering two options for capital investment The second reason to spin off Aquila is that UtiliCorp has invested a great deal of capital in Aquila in order to grow that business and all the proceeds from the IPO are expected to be used by Aquila to repay amounts it owes to its parent company UtiliCorp stands as an example of what is perhaps the new model for energy companies On one hand UtiliCorp remains a conservative and methodical operation which very strategically is gaining scale throughout its service territory in the Midwest and beyond The company attempted two mergers last year one with Empire District Electric Company and the other with St Joseph Power Light Co The merger attempt with Empire failed due to regulatory obstacles but as noted UtiliCorp did complete the million merger with St Joseph about a month ago However the real emphasis coming from the company seems to be clearly placed on Aquila an aggressive and ambitious energy operation that I project will dramatically expand its trading and telecom bandwidth operations over the next year The IPO of Aquila should elevate its stature considerably as new funding opportunities should enable the company to expand its scope into new markets Aquila clearly acknowledges that it is attempting to take advantage of opportunities associated with ongoing electric deregulation in the United States and abroad As regulated utilities continue to unbundle their generation transmission and distribution services we expect to continue capitalizing on opportunities to create value Aquila said in its SEC filing This has always been a good complement to its parent company UtiliCorp which as noted remains rather conservative and steeped in the distribution side of the energy business The earnings profiles for both the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary are strong and since both companies should continue to attract separate sets of investors the timing appears to be right for a spinoff of Aquila In early February UtiliCorp announced record results for including a percent increase in earnings per share and a percent increase in sales Earnings available for common shares were million reflecting in large part the increased contributions from Aquila In fact Aquilas earnings before interest and taxes reached million a percent increase over Aquilas Wholesale Services earned million a percent increase over As of midmorning on April UtiliCorp shares were priced at about The company has a market capitalization of billion and a PE ratio of The average PE ratio for a standard utility operation is around Once the spinoff from its parent occurs Aquilas PE ratio will most likely be in the range of to on par with Mirant and NRG An archive list of previous IssueAlerts

Utility Services Green Mountain Energy Company featuring the leading brand of cleaner and renewable energy announced the completion of the countrys largestever energy aggregation contract encompassing more than Ohio electricity customers The groundbreaking sixyear agreement was struck with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council NOPEC a public electricity buying group which represents households across eight Ohio counties Under the ter ms of the contract Green Mountain Energy Company will begin serving residenti al customers across the NOPEC area with cleaner and renewable energy beginning Sept Analysis This announcement came out two weeks ago but it draws attention to a growing trend for energy aggregation in the state of Ohio Although full competition began in the state on Jan Ohio is maintaining a market development period that will last for the next three to five years During this period residential customers will continue to receive a percent reduction in the generation cost of their electric bill and hopefully take the time to make educated choices about where their power supply originates However what many Ohioans may not fully understand is that the many cities in the state actively engage in load aggregation a program that empowers t he cities to select power suppliers for their residents unless the residents clearly opt out of the aggregation According to the Consumers Counsel of the State of Ohio which recently issued an assessment report on deregulation in the state an estimated residential customers in FirstEnergy territories have switched to n ew suppliers About AEP Cinergy and Dayton Power Light residential customers have switched Note that these figures do not include many new aggregation contracts In addition electric suppliers have been certified with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio PUCO to provide electric generation services to Ohios residential consumers Of these jus t two currently have offers on the table and are soliciting new customers Consequently the report concluded that Ohio does not yet represent a stron g competitive market and that the true benefits from competition wont materialize in the state for three to five years after the market development period and rate reductions have expired However as municipal aggregation unfolds in Ohio new suppliers such as Green Mountain Energy are finding new competitive opportunities which could serve to jumpstart t he market in the state Although few Ohio residents are consciously making the choice to switch to a new power supplier they might find that their service has been switched ov er to a new provider just the same Ohios restructuring law permits aggregati on of electricity consumers by any entity that becomes certified with the PUCO Aggregation is the process by which consumers pool together their load and form an energy buying group In theory aggregation is supposed to reduce a power suppliers costs as the supplier is serving a group rather than havin g to acquire customers on an individual basis which is an extremely costly proposition These reduced costs typically are passed on to the consumers i n the aggregated group which makes buying power by bulk an attractive idea f or many energy customers Aggregation is not a new concept and has been used b y various buying groups across the country What makes aggregation noteworthy in Ohio is that an unusually large number of cities across the northern par t of the state have now become energy brokers for their residents intending to secure lower rates by engaging in aggregated sales contracts with power suppliers In addition Ohio is unique because many of its cities are automatically putting their residents into an aggregation program unless th e residents take the formal effort to step out of the program Residents within a city in Ohio must approve energy aggregation through a referendum In March the city of Parma Ohio became the first city t o vote in favor of an aggregation plan In fact residents of Parma overwhelming passed the measure giving the city government the authority t o serve as a power broker Since that time a large number of cities througho ut Ohio have followed suit According to a report in The Toledo Blade cities villages townships and counties across the state have voted on aggregation ordinances and according to the paper the ordinances have pass ed overwhelmingly in all areas The most current data available from PUCO indicates that cities have filed applications to become energy aggregators and that citiesincluding Cleveland and Toledohave b een formally certified to buy power on behalf of their residents Note that NOPEC which has secured the contract with Green Mountain Energy counts fo r one certification although the group represents more than municipalities These cities serving as the aggregating agents negotiate offers with powe r suppliers and purchase energy services on behalf of the buying group in Ohio this means any resident of a particular city that has been approved a s an aggregator The mostoften identified driver behind the move toward aggregation is the anticipated savings that a city believes it will be able to secure for its residents For instance the Toledo City Council reported ly sold its residents on the idea of aggregation by predicting that savings in the range of to percent could be achieved The incumbent utility servi ng the Toledo area is Toledo Edison a subsidiary of FirstEnergy which reportedly has the highest rates in the state Naturally Toledo residents embraced the aggregation plan with great enthusiasm The city of Toledo is still negotiating contracts with power suppliers but at this point has not received an acceptable bid Under Toledos aggregation plan the city has established that it will competitively bid and negotiate a contract with a competitive retail electric supplier to provide firm allrequirements service to the members of the aggregation program The contract will be for fixedpriced service to each class of customers at a rate that is lower tha n the standard offer from Toledo Edison Ohio law stipulates that a city can select either an optin or an optout approach to aggregation Under the optin approach energy customers must provide written notice to their city that they wish to be included in the aggregation program The optout approach requires that customers must formally notify their city that they do not wish to be included in the aggregation There are large promotional and administrative costs for the cities associated with the optin approach In addition many potential pow er suppliers made it clear that they would not bid on power contracts unless t he cities used an optout approach Consequently every city that has been certified in Ohio to become an energy aggregator is using the optout approach This in and of itself makes Ohio extremely unique Only one other state Massachusetts uses an optout approach to aggregation but it does not match the size and scope of the Ohio program The optout policy of the Ohio aggregation program has sparked a great deal of debate Proponents argue that residents will secure significant benefits from the aggregation process namely lower rates For instance in a powe r supply Memorandum of Understanding that the city of Alliance Ohio has established with Shell Energy savings in the range of to percent off o f the incumbents Ohio Edison residential rates are expected In addition proponents contend that municipalities electing to become an energy broker are providing an added service to their residents which is part of a large r trend of cities aggregating such services as water service garbage collection and sewage service Regarding the issue of the optout approach proponents of municipal aggregation say that residents are given multiple opportunities to notify the city that they do not want to participate in th e aggregation A resident has the option of continuing to receive service fro m the incumbent utility as long as they formally notify the city of this decision Opponents on the other hand argue that municipal aggregation amounts to nothing more than customer slamming since being assigned by the city to a new power supplier may be an involuntary act for those that did not consciously opt in for aggregation Also opponents take issue with aggregation because under the guise of customer choice customers still find themselves tied to the city aggregator unless they opt out which ma y preclude other power suppliers from entering that particular market In fac t as evidence of the policies related to the optout approach opponents migh t point to a stipulation under the City of Toledos Aggregation Plan in a filing with the PUCO Toledos policy asserts that a day optout period will be offered every two years during which customers can leave the City s aggregated pool without paying a switching fee The underlying result of this is that customers can only opt out of aggregation during a small windo w period every two years or incur undisclosed switching fees In addition opponents say that on average customers tend to switch power suppliers at the low rate of to percent even when they find themselv es paying higher bills or are offered a better supply contract Thus the vast majority of customers might end up remaining with a city aggregator simply due to inertia or a lack of understanding about their available options Those who question the value of municipal aggregation also suspect that cities might earn a financial gain from serving as an energy broker or atta ch extra hidden fees to customers to compensate for administrative costs or consultant fees There is also the possibility that the city will not be able to secure lowe r rates than those already in place with the incumbent utility Analysts have raised the question of what would happen if a city secures a contract with a power supplier and then for whatever reason the power supplier cannot fulfill its obligation to provide the power such as in a bankruptcy situation Would the incumbent utility be required to resume service for t he aggregated customers In other words who becomes the provider of last reso rt under a municipally aggregated model Based on the city of Alliance aggregation model if the power supplier defaults on its service the aggregated customers are entitled to return to the incumbent utility under a standard offer service While this offers a safety net for the customer it puts a potential burden on the incumbent utility with regard to its load planning and the difficulty in scheduling for a group of customers that may or may not return to its service Yet also from the incumbent utilitys perspective proponents of aggregati on say that utilities are often required to meet established targets related t o the percentage of their customer base that switches to a new energy provide r Such is the case with Ohio utilities such as FirstEnergy which will be penalized unless they meet their targets Consequently an incumbent utilit y often will have a divided reaction to aggregation On one hand the incumbe nt is potentially losing a core of its customer base but on the other hand it recognizes that aggregation may offer one mechanism for meeting its switchi ng targets Also unregulated affiliates of the incumbent utilities often end up being the ones bidding on the power supply contracts with the cities This is in fact the case with an unregulated affiliate of FirstEnergy which reportedly has made power supply bids with several Ohio cities that are aggregating In summary Ohio remains a test bed for the practice of municipal aggregation There is little doubt that at least in the northern half of t he state city governments are actively promoting themselves as energy brokers and remain confident that they can secure lower energy rates for their residents It will be interesting to see if Ohios aggregated cities can in fact achieve the goals they have established and how Ohio residents react when they begin receiving power from the citychosen supplier

Sale of Generation Plants ReRegulation Now Likely for State by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from California Energy Markets Nevada officials rushed through measures designed to stop the sale of power plants by Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power with a total value estimated at billion The Nevada Assembly voted to pass Assembly Bill which halts the plant sales and stops restructuring in the state Analysis For the last several weeks Nevada officials monitoring the energ y industry in the state have oscillated between assisting the financially strapped utilities under parent company Sierra Pacific Resources or preventing what they fear will be a repeat of the California energy crisis The measure taken late last week by the Nevada Assembly is essentially an attempt to ensure costbased rates in the state reduce the potential risk of summer blackouts and wait out the uncertainty surrounding power supply and electricity prices in the West However the measure does little to allevia te the financial burden weighing on Nevadas major utility companies and in fact raises the possibility for further debts that Sierra Pacific and Nevad a Power may have to carry to comply with several of the measures related requirements The key provision of Assembly Bill blocks the sale of power plants befo re July although Nevada utilities will be allowed to apply to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada PUCN for plant sales that include a state of substantial financial emergency after July The measure directly impacts a pending sale to AES Corp of a percent interest MW in the Mohave Generating Station located in Laughlin Nev that is presently owned by Nevada Power AES had agreed to pay million for t he percent interest in the plant Under terms of the states restructuring legislation Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power were ordered to sell the ir power plants to alleviate concerns about market power Toward that end the holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a publi c auction of approximately MW of power generation facilities Of Sierra Pacific Resources nine power plants which are mostly fired by natural gas and coal seven had been entered into sales agreements and were awaiting final approval when this Assembly measure was passed The PUCN had actually approved the sale of the Mohave plant last year representing the first sales transactions of one of the utilities plants However since th e PUCN granted its approval of the Mohave plant Nevada officials have grown increasingly concerned about instability in the Western power markets and t he power supply problems in California Tom Hay chief of the Nevada Attorney Generals Bureau of Consumer Protection initiated the block against the sale out of concern about power supply in the state Specifically Hay proposed that the Mohave plant shoul d remain under the control of Nevada Power for the time being because it burn s coal a lowcost fuel that can be relied upon to stave off blackouts in the state In addition Hay raised the concern that should the sale of the pla nt be approved the new owner AES could decide to sell the power produced by t he plant outside of the state after a twoyear buy back agreement expires in By keeping the Mohave and other generating plants under the ownership of Nevada utilities state officials believe that they can retain regulator y control over the price of power Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn agreed that the plants should not be sold at th is time and said that keeping the plants would protect Nevadans against high prices on the wholesale power markets Guinn also expressed his intention t o block restructuring in the state throughout his term as governor which end s in If he is elected for a second term and can see that the markets ha ve stabilized in the West Guinn said he would consider allowing competition i n the state sometime after For its part AES says that it will seek legal action to force the sale of the plant to proceed AES argues that the Nevada Assemblys measure is not constitutional and violates the sales contract already approved by the PUCN AES also pointed out that the Mohave plant is years old and will require significant repairs and improvement an investment that it was willing to make but one that would cause an unnecessary financial burden on Nevada Power Moreover the negative financial impact that the Nevada Assemblys measure might cause is a major point of contention for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific along with the two Assembly members who voted against the measure A spokesperson for the utilities said pending sales of power plants would provide the two companies with about billion in cash which would go a long way to help us buy fuel and purchase power As I discussed in my IssueAlert the utilities parent company Sierra Pacific Resources continues to struggle financially so much so that a pending acquisition of Portland General has now been scrapped Sierra Pacific Resources reported a significant fourthquarter loss million as a result of soaring cost s of power in the western United States The company incurred losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in th e volatile wholesale market The company attributed the latest quarters los s to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Although the Nevada Assemblys measure passed with a vote one assembly member recognized the fact that if we weaken the utilities to the point where they cant borrow to purchase fuel we wont have power Consequentl y the state could still find itself with a compromised power supply despite its efforts to retain state control over existing power plants Additional financial burden could be placed on Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific as a result of other requirements that are included in related Assembly measures For instance AB calls for gradually increasing the amount of green power used by the utilities to percent from its current percent The bill allows for the PUCN to fine the utilities a day or a total of million for failing to buy the required amount of renewable energy Although a representative of Sierra Pacific Resources sai d that the company supports the use of renewable power the Assembly measure s requirement was considered so much so quick so fast The block on the power sales and indefinite delay in the start of competiti on essentially returns Nevada to a reregulated state This is another example of the continuing fallout that has resulted from the California energy crisis especially among neighboring states in the West As another example New Mexico recently decided to also delay the start of competition until Western states which in one way or another have felt the direct impa ct of the power crunch in California have become more cautious about deregulation and seemingly are in no hurry to open their markets to competition despite the fact that deregulation proceeds in other areas of the country However unlike California where the state government now has an active ro le in purchasing power and may take over the utilities transmission assets Nevada Gov Guinn has expressed no interest in having the state or local governments take over the jobs of electric utility companies Rather Guinn merely wants to retain the control that the state traditionally has had ove r setting utility costbased rates an authority that would become diluted if outofstate power companies own generation assets located in Nevada Further Guinn wants to return to deferred energy rates also known as fueladjustment clauses in which a utility is allowed to seek dollarfordollar adjustments in rates to recover costs associated with purchasing power on the wholesale market As opposed to monthly rate increases Guinn believes that an annual rate increasewhich Nevada Powe r and Sierra Pacific would have to request and justifywould smooth out the u ps and downs of power and fuel costs over the year In addition Guinn believ es that the combination of state regulation and costbased rates offers a bett er strategy for the state than attempting retail competition at this time To supplement power supply Guinn believes that Nevada should promote the use of merchant plants rather than relying on the incumbent utilities to build additional generation Moreover the Nevada Assembly measure brings competition in the state to a screeching halt at least for the next few years However the larger issu e at hand presently is the precarious financial state of Sierra Pacific Resources and its utilities Without the cash that would have been gained from the sales of its power plants it is unclear how Sierra Pacific Resources will be able to pull itself out of debt The utility already received an emergency rate increase last month so any attempt to secure additional increases would surely be politically unpopular Gov Guinns proposal regarding deferred energy rates may provide a mechanism to bring Sierra Pacifics rates more in line with its costs but most likely such a rate increase would take effect only once a year Meanwhile Sierra Pacific must still procure some power on the wholesale market where prices remain high a situation that could get ever worse this summer if warm temperature s drive up demand Thus ironically as much as state officials have tried t o avoid the energy crisis found in its western neighbor Nevada is increasing ly exhibiting some of the same fundamental problems found in California

chairman and CEO of Baltimorebased Constellation Energy Group NYSE CEG announced that it will create two pure play energy companies midtolate this year to focus exclusively on the North American wholesale market and regional retail energy services in Maryland and the surrounding region Both entities will become publicly traded companies before the end of the year Constellation Energy Group is a holdi ng company that includes a group of competitive energy businesses focused most ly on power marketing and merchant generation in North America plus Baltimore Gas Electric BGE a regulated energy company in Central Maryland In Constellation reported combined revenues of billion and total assets of billion Analysis Constellations plan to separate into two publicly traded compani es has been in the works for over a year In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its unregulated merchant energy business wholesale power marketing and generation operations and the other focused on retail services including the regulated electric and gas utility BGE As part of this process Constellation combined its diverse generation portfolio power plant operations and development efforts with its energy marketing and trading organization The company has clearly stated that the primary reason for bifurcating its operations is to enhance shareholder value Constellation has said that the separation of the businesses will illuminate the specific investment advantages of each emerging company and allow investors to make decisions based on a clearer assessment of each companys balance of risk and return Upon separation the holding company of the merchant energy businesses will retain the Constellation Energy Group name The holding company of the reta il services businesses will become BGE Corp Current shareholders will own shares in each company when the transactions are completed In addition th e Constellation board of directors has approved a move to allow Goldman Sachs to become an equity owner of up to percent in the unregulated business Goldman Sachs has been a partner with Constellation since providing risk management and power marketing services The split of the business can be seen as primarily benefiting Constellation s unregulated operations which provide the real moneymaking opportunities f or the company In return the high growth of the unregulated businesses and i ts new status as a standalone company is expected to benefit Constellation shareholders Constellation Energys merchant energy business is made up primarily of the following subsidiaries Constellation Power Source Incwholesale power marketing and trading Constellation Power Source Generation Inc which has ownership of foss il and hydroelectric power plants formerly owned by BGE Constellation Power Inc and subsidiariesdevelopment and management of existing power plants throughout the United States and Constellation Nuclear LLC and subsidiariesnuclear generation and consulting Poindexter has said that delivering solutions to the companys wholesale customers is the foundation of Constellations business as opposed to the more traditional operations found on the regulated side Further the companys primary growth strategies center on the nonregulated domestic merchant energy business with the objective of providing new sources of earnings growth The company is planning to divest generation assets in international markets such as Latin America and focus exclusively on its unregulated businesses in the United States Toward that end Constellation has focused over the last year on aggressive ly building its generation portfolio Currently the company controls more tha n MW of power capacity and over the course of this year plans to add MW of gasfired peaking capacity as well as complete a recently announced acquisition of MW of the Nine Mile Point nuclear facility i n New York The goal for the merchant energy business according to Poindexte r is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Up until this point Constellations generation assets have been primarily based in a mixture of coal and nuclear and for the mos t part located in the Northeastern United States According to information directly from the company itself Constellations own fuel mix is predominantly coal percent followed by nuclear percent Oil gas and hydro only represent a small percentage percent of Constellations fuel mix However moving forward it is expected that nuclear power will play an increasingly important role in Constellations competitive strategy Constellations merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth Revenues in Constellations unregulated businesses totaled billion for yearend almost half of the tota l revenues for the company Segment earnings for reflected a shift in earnings from the regulated utility business to the nonregulated domestic merchant energy business as a result of the transfer of BGEs electric generation assets to nonregulated subsidiaries on July Constellation believes that a reasonable range for earnings per share on a total company basis is to More than twothirds of the total earnings is expected to come from the domestic merchant energy business wi th the remainder coming from BGE and the other businesses that will comprise t he new BGE Corp as part of the business separation strategy Meanwhile BGE remains a consistent performer and in fact contributed the majority of Constellations revenues over the course of billion out of a total of billion BGEs fourth quarter electric sales volume s increased nearly percent as compared to This increase in the fourth quarter helped to offset a portion of the decline in electric sales experienced during the summer of BGE will remain a regulated provider of gas and electricity delivery services in central Maryland However as a regulated entity Constellation apparently believes that BGE will not provi de the same level of profit potential as the unregulated merchant business an d therefore the company wants to attract two different sets of investors FERC approved Constellations separation plan in early March The company still needs to receive approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Internal Revenue Service Also related to Constellations separation process is a change in the companys common stock dividend policy effective in April At that tim e Constellations annual dividend is expected to be set at per share After the separation BGE Corp expects to pay initial annual dividends of per share Constellation Energy Group as a growing merchant energy company initially expects to reinvest its earnings in order to fund its growth plans and not to pay a dividend Constellations strategy falls into a growing trend among energy companies attempting to streamline their businesses for competitive markets For instance last fall American Electric Power NYSE AEP announced its plans to restructure into two companies to support a new focus on power generatio n marketing and trading Under the restructuring one corporation will hold AEPs utility and nonutility subsidiaries whose revenues are derived from competitive unregulated business ventures The second corporation will ho ld AEPs utility subsidiaries primarily Tsubsidiaries that are subject to regulation by at least one state regulatory commission or foreign subsidiaries subject to rates or tariffs regulation It is not clear if AEP will opt to take both companies public Linn Draper AEPs CEO has said th at the company is reserving that decision until the end of the time at which he believes the restructuring will have received all the necessary regulatory approvals In addition just yesterday Mirant NYSE MIR completed its spinoff from parent Southern Company and is now recognized as a fully independent publicly traded company Mirant is a global competitive energy company with a leading position in both power generation and energy risk management and marketing With an integrated business model Mirant develops constructs owns and operates power plants and sells wholesale electricity natural gas and other energy commodities Other parent companies that have announced the spinoff of unregulated generation companies into standalone and possibly publicly traded companie s include UtiliCorp Reliant and Xcel Energy As noted the common driver behind the growing trend of spinning off highrisk highgrowth ventures into standalone companies is the hope of attracting two sets of investors For instance lets take a look at the Southern Company Mirant example as Mirant has just completed its spinoff from Southern Southern Companys PE multiple is compared to Mirant s The price earnings ratio is typically used to gauge a firms measure of value and can be used to compare a company to its peers and industry average The average PE ratio of a traditional utility company is somewher e around A PE ratio much higher than the average signals that the company has a highrisk highreward profile However the general consensu s is that the traditional utility investor does not have the riskappetite fo r an IPPtype company The IPP stock carries more risk than the average utili ty and does not guarantee a dividend payment On the other hand with risk com es reward Consequently companies such as Southern Constellation and the others mentioned are finding that by splitting nonregulated and regulated businesses they can attract two different sets of investors and safeguard any possible negative earnings impact that might spill over from one side o f the business to the other An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility

of electricity and naturalgas marketing giant Enron Corp NYSE ENE slid further on Thursday March amid broader weakness in energy stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year Enro n was off or percent at on March after falling percent on March So far this year Enrons stock is down about percent vers us a percent decline for Standard Poors utilities index and a percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average Analysis Over the last several weeks a growing number of smaller emergin g energy companies have felt the impact from the nations struggling economy and the likelihood of an impending recession Just recently startup companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have withdrawn their IPO plans citing an anemic stock market and the lack of positive cash flow A look across the stock market can send shivers down th e spines of most energy company CEOs as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below the point for the first time in two years and the Nasd aq composite remains percent off of its March high of putting the economy in bear market territory However while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies may crash and burn the giant energy company that is Enron Corp typically has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the US economy Over the course of Enron shares returned percent and traded at roughly times trailing earnings reportedly more than times the multiple of its some of its main competitors or the S Nevertheless Enrons winning streak in the stock market may be eroding as the waves that are crashing around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same whirlpool For perspective Enrons closest competitors across its various business lines Williams and Dynegy also appear to be taking the hit from the bear market Williams NYSE WMB saw its stock decline or percent to on March Dynegy NYSE DYN saw its stock drop or percent to Of course of the three companies Enron wields the highest PE ratio at and largest market capitalization at billion By comparison Williams has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion while Dynegy has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion Analysts that keep a close eye on Enrons stock say the sudden decline is n ot a reflection of any new business developments at the company but rather a market that is struggling in general and a growing disenchantment among investors in technology and telecommunications in particular This may be having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron g stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the telecommunications broadband market Just as the company has achieved unparalleled success in electricity and naturalgas trading for the last year Enron has been developing a highspeed broadband communications networ k to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing Enron projects a billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi ng and services by and the valuation of its own broadband business at a share or billion The company plans to trade excess bandwidth capacity and in order to do so is constructing its own network which cost s a lot of money Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between billion and billion in assets over the next months in order to reduce debt and support the new business in broadband among other businesses in pulp and paper data storage and advertising Thus much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business and Enrons role in it Up to this point confidence in both the industry a nd the company have run high Some analysts have reported that interest in Enrons expansion into this area validated by investor interest in new technologies in general drove an percent rise in the companys share price last year Yet once again the tide may be turning Investors no longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not resulted in bottomline profits much as the year before ecommerce stocks also found that their day in the sun ended rather abruptly And although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold its broadband business has remained immature In fact for yearend Enron Broadband Services reported a million IBIT loss reflecting start up costs to build the new business The company seems to have anticipated the slow growth of its broadband business In fact Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a nd six years for the companys naturalgas business to develop standardized contracts and increase liquidity Skilling has said that these numbers do n ot dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe r for the company While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t he broadband business investors may not be as patient Note that while Enron s broadband business took a loss for the company as a whole reported a percent increase in earnings per diluted share to and a percent increase in net income to billion In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for to between and per share In response to the sudden drop in stock price an d speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom e profitable Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it remains ver y comfortable with the earnings estimate An Enron spokesperson also ma de references to information in the market that is inaccurate suggesting th at any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded including potential layoffs at the broadband unit According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom investors polled by First Call Thompson Financial ar e still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of to for Nevertheless despite Enrons reassurances that it remains on track to meet its earnings estimate the companys stock continued to drop As noted investors began to put downward pressure on the stock pushing it to as of March below its week low of and far below its week hi gh of Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai n unclear about what it is that Enron does exactly According to a March article in Fortune magazine entitled Is Enron Overpriced some Wall Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money and the lack of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enrons pricey stock The skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enrons thunder in a bull market b ut that could all change quickly in a bear market Enron may in fact exacerbat e Wall Streets distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its financial records for what it deems competitive reasons The Fortune report which was published before Enrons stock began to decline also indicated that investors are concerned about Enrons debt Although the company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load Enron carried a net billion debt at the end of September Again although investor s may have been able to look the other way from Enrons debt during a strong economy it appears that investors will use a finetooth comb to examine th e companys financial records during the increasingly unstable economy Moreover in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog y and telecommunications stocks investors may also be concerned that a globa l economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole resulting in lower commodity prices Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly validate this theory Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of problems with its broadband unit Looking at the big picture it appears reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i n Enrons stock Rather Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o f

IssueAlert for March New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies Plans for New Power Plant by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Sithe Energies Inc announced that in respon se to issues raised by local residents the company is reassessing its plans f or a power generating facility in Ramapo New York The alternative currently under review is a smaller peaking facility which would use no water for generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure reliability of the regions electricity supply Originally slated as an MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga s the alternative plant is a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas Analysis Sithe Energies original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav e been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant Ramapo is located miles north of New York City Chief amon g the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes In response to the concerns of residents Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output Unfortunately Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t he very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has some rather serious power supply concerns For background it is important to note that Exelon Corp owns nearly half of Sithe Energies In December Exelon acquired percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi percent Marubeni Corp percent and Sithe Management percent The acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon Jim McGowan Sithe senior vice president for development referenced the ro le that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki ng unit in the area Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed McGowan said Weve listened carefully to residents concern s and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean less visible and uses no water for generation McGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil e fulfilling the regions growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand As an independent power producer Sithe Energies owns power plants across t he United States and internationally The company has a generation presence in such states as California Colorado Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania among several others In New York Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately M W Batavia MW Independence Station Scriba NY MW Massena MW Ogdensburg MW and Sterling Sherill NY MW In addition t o the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station an MW power plant located near Lake Ontario A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete However projects under MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement which generally involves a detailedand time consumingexamination of alternatives The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further Ne w York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum heightened by the ongoing problems in California Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies Ramapo plant which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t o generate power While other new plants are being planned in New York realistically it will be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit y to ease concerns about shortages Meanwhile the state enters this summers season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands Ne w York City like other areas of the Northeast the Midwest and California i s in a very serious situation reported a member of the New York Public Service Commission to the New Assembly While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November FERC report entitled Investigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlights specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study says Li ke northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti es of power on constrained transmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densel y populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes i s generated by the city New plants are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be MW short of its required MW generating capacit y needs this summer That projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added This years demand is expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts According to the FERC report New York City s load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incit y capacity along with imports to meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall Long Island has a potential MW shortfall to meet the required MW of power The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with in the next few months the state could suffer some of Californias problems However despite the need for additional power generation in the state the intense public scrutiny of Sithes plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants throughout the state For instance the New York Power Authoritys NYPA plan to install ten MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi on from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group NYIRG which has sued the NYPA charging that it circumvented the environmental review process for siting new plants In addition FERCs report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were approximately projects proposed to be built in New York State as of November The report indicated that only one of these projects is likely to be built in the next three to four years Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit McGowan has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy requirements If it does it will make the same mistakes for which Californ ia is now paying a tremendous price Along the same lines William Muesler CE O of the New York ISO recently said that to avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown New York must move quickly to build more powe r plants Muesler cited that MW of new power plant capacity percent more than is currently available must be constructed in New York by o r shortages will become likely pushing up prices and increasing the odds of rolling blackouts However despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants not in my back yard has been a common response in New York Even New Jerseys acting Governor Donald T DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos e opposing new power plants in the region DiFrancesco reportedly told a meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th at he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec ts in New York and New Jersey Included in the task force are members of DiFrancescos own staff the state Department of Environmental Protection a nd the Attorney Generals Office Moreover although California offers a clear picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate supply New York appears to be heading down a similar path Although California and New York have different restructuring models one market factor is the same in both states supply that cannot meet demand We know the toll that this inequity has had on California Is it only a matter of time before New York suffers the same consequences An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March Dissension at FERC Commission Divided On Price Caps Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters March The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout s and price spikes The three FERC commissioners who regulate interstate electricity markets testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts Analysis Since the start of deregulation in the early s FERCs variou s positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent Despite its changing members as a whole the fivemember commission with two positions currently open has taken a handsoff approach to its regulatory role preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry In fact Curt Hbert appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe n FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether However significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker A s the federal regulatory body for the energy industry FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country Th e debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu re leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt At the House of Representatives meeting on March Hbert a Republican reiterated his objections to price caps Chairman Hbert has maintained his longstanding opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do longterm damage In January Hbert told me I have seen no evidence th at price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level Hbert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other shortterm resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California Reuters reported that Hbert said at the hearings that such controls are n ot a longterm solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West Rather Hbert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants both in California and elsewhere Hbert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand thus correcting the current imbalance Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect Despite Hberts opposition to wholesale price caps fellow Commissioner William Massey a Democrat asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary time out or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju st and reasonable rates Massey said In addition Massey reportedly also sai d that such a price cap could be calculated on a generatorbygenerator basi s at each generators variable operating cost plus a reasonable capacity adder perhaps in the range of per megawatt hour Massey reiterated th e severity of the crisis in California noting that whereas wholesale power i n the state cost billion in it increased to billion in and could exceed billion for Rounding out the commissions divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt a Democrat who said that all possible options should be analyze d and debated Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric e controls Chairman Hberts stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investmen t in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power produce rs to other regions of the country and further away from California The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps Abraham said Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin g is scheduled for later this week Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton a Texas Republican noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o r not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE RC over major issues facing the energy industry The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs FERCs December vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated ThenCommissioner Hbert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT O met FERC guidelines for RTO formation and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO However Hbert stood as a minority The other three commissioners at FERC at the time Hoecker Massey and Breathitt preferred to wield a tight er regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy While Hbert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti es and letting free market principles rule the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities Meanwhile speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to the position of FERC chairman Hbert was named chairman in February by Preside nt Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan At that time the president did not indicate that Hberts appointment as chair was temporary Wood was appoint ed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in and played a primary role i n the development of that states restructuring plan Electric choice begins in Texas on June with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate d There are two Republican openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush As noted presently Hbert is the only Republican among the current three members Wood reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time However the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman forcing Hbert to step back into a role as commissioner The report in Reuters indicated that Hbert a friend and protg of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss is personally fighting the planned move The nomination would require Senate confirmation Moreover as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC th e issue of price caps remains unresolved The debate over price caps also has divided others involved strictly along party lines Generally speaking Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha t has been called price gouging on the part of energy companies Republica ns believe that the government including FERC and the Bush administration should maintain a handsoff approach and allow the marketplace to determi ne prices Speaking from a nonpartisan point of view some economists now question whetherand not just howderegulation of electricity markets should occur at all For instance Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economis t who helped deregulate other industries says that electricity markets may n ot lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities allowing a single regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity The movemen t toward reregulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps Yet in any event once again California remains the catalyst for decisionmaking on this issue As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in to a third day in the state federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country As the industrys top agency in charge of wholesale markets FERCs ultimate position on price ca ps carries tremendous influence Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b e conducted or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in

Energy Spending Expected by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Knight Ridder Washington Bureau March Days after telling the nation th at theres a real energy crisis and vowing to promote alternative energy sources and conservation President Bush is proposing a budget that would reduce federal spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy by as muc h as a third and increase funding for oil and naturalgas drilling Bush proposes to cut the Department of Energys renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by to percent according to Energy Department and White House officials who have briefed energy and environmental lobbyists The presidents proposed Energy Department budget is another indication tha t the administration will emphasize increasing oil naturalgas and coal production more than cutting energy demand or developing alternatives to fossil fuels Analysis During his presidential campaign President Bush was critical of Bill Clinton for failing to adopt a national energy policy Facing unavoidable problems within the nations energy industryincluding the ongoing California problem supply concerns across the country and predictions of several more years of erratic electricity naturalgas and o il pricesBush has been on a fast track to develop his own comprehensive en ergy strategy More than likely the president is still weeks away from unveilin g his official energy plan However the word circulating through Washington DC and the energy industry as a whole is that his plan will emphasize increasing oil natural gas and coal production by giving unique financial incentives to producers and deemphasize conservation efforts and renewabl e energies Given the fact that President Bushs energy plan has not yet been released analysis of the proposed plan is still based on speculation at this point While many opponents of the proposed plan are quick to criticize anticipate d cuts for energy efficiency and renewable energy Bush has not indicated tha t these approaches will not have a role in his administrations strategy It is important to keep in mind that while funding for efficiency and renewables may indeed be reduced there is still is a budget for these technologies in the Department of Energy Bush may believe that the time has now come to le t market forces support further growth of renewable energies such as wind and solar while he searches for a more immediate solution to the significant problems facing the energy industry According to the Knight Ridder report Energy Department spokesperson Joe Davis expects that there will be cuts associated with the departments billion budget in an effort to deal with belttightening In fact Bushs proposed billion DOE budget is million less than what the departme nt now spends Reportedly the cuts are being made so that the president can boost spending on clean coal technology to make the fossil fuel more efficient and less harmful to the environment Rumors of Bushs budget cuts for renewable energy and conservation efforts have sparked an immediate outcry from environmental groups and leaders with in the Democratic Party For instance New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee went on record in disagreement with the proposed cuts Clearly if we dont dedicate adequate resources to research and development for energy efficiency we lose our ability to benefit from this technology Bingaman said Renewable energy supporters point to the fact that the clean coal technolog y program already in place still has about million in unspent funding despite the fact that it has produced few usable results In addition conservation advocates refer to a report concluding that the Department of Energys conservation program has already saved billion and quadrillion Btus of energy The overall consensus of the groups that oppose Bushs expected spending cuts is that now more than ever spending for renewable energy and conservation programs should be increased not cut It has already been well established that President Bush supports opening u p federally protected lands for increased oil and naturalgas drilling The president has made no secret of his intention to move forward with the controversial step to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR in Alaska The Bush administration is pushing to open and develop for drilling percent of ANWR which consists of million tundra acres and spans miles along the Arctic Ocean Throughout his campaign President Bush reiterated that he would make this move a point on which he differed sharp ly from Al Gore who maintained that he would keep the land protected For som e time it was expected that Bushs energy plan would also include expanded conservation efforts and increased funding for alternative fuels However according to Bushs team the short answer to the electricity shortage that has rocked California and put fear into the rest of the country is to increase domestic supplies of natural gas coal and oil all of which can be used to run power plants As another action plan President Bush has argued that the United States needs to become more autonomous when it comes to meeting its energy needs The Bush administration has claimed that the United States has become too dependent on foreign sources of oil especially when there are abundant reserves that can be processed domestically Yet its also important to no te that President Bush has never suggested that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will be sufficient Rather the president recognizes that acces s to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States and the global economy However instead of relying predominantly on the Middle East Bush will wor k more closely with Canada and Mexico to increase crossborder flows of oil natural gas and electricity within North America Toward that end Bush has asked Mexicos President Vincente Fox to help by allowing private US capital to build electricity plants and transmission lines in Mexico that would send power north This has been a rather contentious issue in Mexico a country that has had a longstanding history of stateowned electricity Pa st proposals to privatize or allow even minimal levels of private investment i n Mexico have been widely denounced Fox has responded that Mexico is having trouble meeting its own power needs let alone being able to send power to the United States However Fox has agreed to work with President Bush on establishing a regional energy plan between the two countries with the objective of providing enough power to fuel their growing economies Running concurrent to Bushs proposed energy plan is a comprehensive energy bill reportedly being developed by Senate Republicans under the leadership of Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski a Republican from Alaska The bill appears to be a mirror image of the policies expected in Bushs energy plan including drilling in the ANWR and also tax breaks offered to the oil industry For instance the measure reportedly would gra nt oil producers operating on federal lands a break on their royalty payments to the government along with granting federal royalty relief for producers operating in deep waters and difficult formations such as tight rocks and coal beds In addition the bill would require that federal agencies such a s the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Interior Department confi rm with the Energy Secretary before taking any action that would have a significant effect of reducing domestic energy supply Of course earlier this month the US Supreme Court granted extended power to the EPA to regulate emissions from utility power plants along with othe r industries In one of the most important environmental and business decisio ns in decades the Supreme Court rejected industry arguments that the federal government must consider cost and not just health benefits in setting national air pollution standards Largely rejecting arguments by business groups the Supreme Court said that the EPA has the power to issue new standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air Prior to this ruling it was suggested that President Bush was also considering relaxing some environmental standards to allow electrical plants to expand capacity It is unknown at this point whether or not Bush will still go in this direction considering that the Supreme Court unanimously sided with t he EPAs authority in these matters Moreover it may be premature to draw any conclusions about President Bush s energy plan until the official strategy is released and we can assess specific numbers I have not seen anything that would indicate that the president does not support a significant role for renewable energies such a s wind and solar along with increased conservation efforts In fact recall that Bush was an active participant in the Texas restructuring legislation in which the Renewables Portfolio Standard requires that approximately percent of fuel generation comes from renewable sources In fact the deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compared to the states that have enacted legislatio n for electric competition Consequently during his tenure as Governor of Texas President Bush demonstrated support for alternative forms of energy However as demand continues to outpace supply on a national basis the president appears to be looking for an immediate solution which more than likely will give priority to largescale production plants efforts includin g coal natural gas and nuclear In the next few weeks when President Bushs energy plan is formally released it may very well emerge that his administration proposes a more balanced approach to the nations energy needs which still includes conservation efforts and exploration of renewab le energies An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American Power System b y RDIFT Energy is now

IssueAlert for March California May Be Headed for Another Volatile Summer How Much Power Is Needed to Save the State by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Unless Gov Gray Davis arranges significantly more longterm electricity contracts or convinces people to turn off a lot more lights Californias unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc again this summer Ev en with the longterm deals announced by Davis on March up to percent of the states daily needs may have to be bought on the highly volatile spot market where power is purchased a day ahead of when it is needed That cou ld prove hugely expensive for the state because if this past years spot mark et prices are an indicator then California might see spot market prices at fi ve to six times more costly than what they would be under the longterm contracts Analysis Despite the somewhat reassuring announcements that the state of California has lined up various new longterm contracts for the supply of power it remains questionable if the power secured in the contracts will b e enough to prevent another long hard summer for the state and its residents In fact some predictions suggest that summer could be just as bad or worse as summer leading to another series of rolling blackouts and spikes in spot market prices To date California has spent upwards of million a day a total of billion since January to buy electricity on the spot market The longterm contracts in which the state has engaged are intended to lock in cheaper prices and cut down the amount of electricity the state has to buy in the volatile shortterm market On March Gov Davis announced that the state of Californiathrough th e Department of Water Resources DWR the newly appointed power purchasing agencyhas agreed to power purchase contracts with more than gener ators and marketers which will supply an average of MW per year over the next years The contracts varying in length from four months to year s and worth billion in total reportedly will provide the state with a diversified longterm power portfolio said Davis in an announcement According to a report in Megawatt Daily the average price of the deals is MWh over the entire year period For the first five years the avera ge price will be MWh dropping to MWh for the period between and Gov Davis has offered that these prices are between and percen t lower than recent spot market prices although they are higher than the original goal of MWh that Davis had established when he first began to negotiate longterm contracts In a noticeable omission the governor has refused to identify exactly how much power from longterm contracts will be available to the state this summer There has been a string of announcements regarding the longterm contracts so we know some of the companies that are entering into agreements with the state For instance Calpine Corp locked the DWR into a year contra ct for the sale of approximately MW of electricity California will be paying a fixed price for the power it buys from Calpine but most reports have placed the value of the deal in the range of billion Dynegy and NRG Energy said that they have agreed to sell up to MWenough to p ower about million homesto the DWR under contracts lasting through According to the companies their California generating affiliatesEl Se gundo Power LLC Long Beach Generation LLC and Cabrillo Iwill provide up to MW of power to the state from today through the rest of increasing deliveries of MW from Jan Mirant Corp formerly Southern Energy announced an agreement to shift MW in power contracts from th e California Power Exchange to the states DWR These are just a few examples among other companies such as Avista Duke Enron PacifiCorp and Williams that have signed on to serve the state unde r longterm contracts Absent from the list is Reliant Energy which reportedly is in negotiations with the DWR but reluctant to commit to more than a day contract to sell power to the state Reliant is owed over million for power delivered to Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE in November and December The two major utilitie s owe more than billion to powergenerating companies and cant buy more having no credit or cash to make the purchases which is what prompted to t he state to appoint the DWR into the power purchasing role Gov Davis has said With these deals in place Californias energy future is looking a whole lot brighter But is it really That is the question of the hour Representatives for the governor have indicated that the longter m contracts will reduce the states need to purchase power on the spot market over the next years by about percent Yet of more immediate concern to analysts is what will transpire during the fastapproaching summer heat wh en demand increases This represents a quite precarious scenario the start of which is only about two months away Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles on March Davis said state DWR negotiators have so far been able to meet between and percent of the states power needs for the coming summer based on last summers consumption The governor again called on residents to cut usage by percent over last year Despite the tempered optimism associated with these announced longterm contracts the general consensus is that however much power Gov Davis has lined up for this summer it wont be enough In fact when pressed for details about how muc h power would be available this summer Davis conceded that the state will still have to buy to percent of its power on the expensive shortterm market As noted the longterm contracts that have been established thus far vary in length from four months to years However when doing the math for the anticipated summer season the calculation of what will be needed versus wh at will be available paints a pretty alarming picture During the month of Augusttypically the hottest month in Californiapeak daily demand fo r power in the California ISO territory is expected to hit about MW The states three IOUsPGE SCE and San Diego Gas Electricstill gener ate about MW from their remaining power plants and have longterm contrac ts from wind solar and other energy sources that gains them an additional MW of power Gov Davis has established that about MW from the longterm contracts will be available this summer In addition back in February Davis announced a plan to expedite new power plants in the state which he promised would bring MW online by July an ambitious goal th at may or may not materialize Altogether assuming that all of these projections are reliable the total comes to about MW that we know should be available in California this summer leaving the state about MW short for its power supply needs Gov Davis may continue to secure longterm contracts with other power suppliers Or then again he may not be able to do so Most of the promine nt power suppliers operating in the United States have already signed deals wi th the DWR and are included in the MW that is already expected for the summer Thus there is a strong chance that the bulk of the MW neede d by California will have to be bought on the spot market where prices are projected to remain high at least through the beginning of next year Reportedly just within the last week last minute prices on Californias spot market averaged MWh compared to MWh which is the average of the longterm contracts Some officials including Gov Davis have said that now more than ever conservation in California is critical Representatives of the governor hav e suggested that if Californians reduce their electricity usage by percent conservation efforts across the state could reduce peak demand by nearly MW Or perhaps a traditional rain dance would be in order California is due f or a cooler summer season after the two previous summers that were unseasonabl y warm A rainy season would bring cooler temperatures to the state and thus drive down the anticipated demand for the summer which is based on last years load If the state is fortunate enough to receive a rainy season or otherwise coolerthanexpected summer then the state could squeak by with enough power supply resources to accommodate anticipated demand If summer is another unseasonably warm one for the state the plan that is presently in place sounds like a blueprint for another volatile and expensi ve summer for California An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American Power

Pacific Resources Acquisition of Portland General Appears Uncertain by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The probability appears to be getting smaller that Sierra Pacific Resources NYSE SRP will complete its billion acquisition of Portland General Electric NYSE PGB from Enron NYSE ENE Enron disclosed in an K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Feb that the sale of Portland General had been delayed because of recent events in California and Nevada that affected Sierra Pacific Walt Higgins chair and CEO of Sierra Pacific Resources told Wall Street analysts that the acquisition agreement will terminate if it has not closed by May Analysis Yesterday I wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities NU Now another highprofile merger appears to be unraveling As with the Con Edison NU deal the problem facing Sierra Pacific Resources pending purchase of Portland General from Enron is based in economics Namely it appears that Sierra Pacific Resources recent financial problems have cast doubt on the companys ability to complete its purchase of Portland General This is not a good development for Sierra Pacific Resources as the financial and legal implications of this potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the companys current financial problems First let me provide some background on this deal The origin of Sierra Pacific Resources attempt to acquire Portland General date back to November Enron had purchased the company in as a strategic move to facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of California and the Pacific Northwest At the time Enron saw itself as a prototype for the future of the energy industry adding transmission and distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its already successful wholesale marketing core Stymied by the slow start of competition in California and Oregon Enron underwent a transformation in its corporate philosophy Under the growing direction of Jeffrey Skilling Enron no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in the top tier of energy companies That philosophy has served Enron well as its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented Yet Enrons transformation opened the door for Sierra Pacific Resources a relatively small and regionally based holding company to move in for a purchase of Portland General Owning Portland General made more sense for Sierra Pacific Resources than it did for Enron Portland General which provides electric service to over customers in the PortlandSalem area was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help Sierra Pacific Resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fastgrowing states Nevada and Oregon Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to pay Enron billion for Portland General which included billion in cash and assumption of Enrons million merger payment obligation In addition Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to assume billion in Portland General debt and preferred stock taking the total value of the purchase to billion Portland General appeared happy with the scheduled sale from Enron acknowledging that its own core business delivering safe and reliable power with a customer service focus was more in line with Sierra Pacific Resources However a number of economic factors on Sierra Pacific Resources side of the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition As I discussed in the Feb IssueAlert available at wwwconsultrcicom Sierra Pacific Resources reported a significant fourthquarter loss million as a result of soaring costs of power in the western United States The company incurred losses as a direct result of the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in the volatile wholesale market As a result Sierra Pacific Resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase Without some rate relief the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling our ability to serve the needs of our customers said Mark Ruelle the companys chief financial officer The company attributed the latest quarters loss to nearly million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs Specifically Sierra Pacific Resources reported a Q loss of million or cents a share This compared with a profit of million or cents a share excluding a million deferred energy writeoff a year ago Including the writeoff the company reported a loss of million or cents a share in Q For yearend the company reported a net loss of million or cents per share a percent drop from In addition the companys stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks at one point dropping percent to on the New York Stock Exchange Feb At the close of trading on March shares of Sierra Pacific Resources were priced at which is still down from its week high of and book value of The drop in stock price could make it difficult for Sierra Pacific Resources to secure the financing necessary to complete the purchase of Portland General Meanwhile Sierra Pacific Resources available cash flow could be impacted by possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants The Public Utility Commission of Nevada PUCN mandated divestiture as a condition of the merger between Nevada Power Co and Sierra Pacific Power Co which created the holding company Sierra Pacific Resources Toward that end the holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public auction of approximately MW of power generation facilities Of Sierra Pacific Resources nine power plants which are mostly fired by natural gas and coal seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as Dynegy and NRG and will be sold upon final regulatory approval However over the last few weeks there has been growing concern that Nevada regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of additional power plants by Sierra Pacific Resources thus preventing the company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of Portland General Perhaps out of fears about depleting the Nevadas power supply the Attorney Generals Bureau of Consumer Protection the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the AFLCIO have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed or canceled Further Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn has called on the PUCN to reconsider the order that required Sierra Pacific Resources to sell the plants owned by its two utilities Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Any available cash that Sierra Pacific Resources was planning to use from the power plant sales to support its acquisition of Portland General may not materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated Ironically Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Co just received approval from the PUCN to secure billion in bank loans bond financing and preferred securities However due to agreements that the utilities previously made none of the borrowed money may be used directly or indirectly to financially support its parents acquisition of Portland General Thus Sierra Pacific Resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place regarding this purchase which it apparently still wants to complete It would appear that Sierra Pacific Resources will have difficulty financing the purchase of Portland General due to the combination of its significant financial losses plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the sale of its power plants Presumably these are the recent events to which Enron referred in its SEC filing It is fairly clear that Enron no longer wishes to own Portland General and believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing growth What remains in question however is what will happen if Sierra Pacific Resources pending acquisition is not completed by the May deadline thus terminating the sales agreement The problems associated with the Con Edison NU merger are leading to litigation One cant help but think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the Enron Portland General Sierra Pacific Resources case as well as Enron presumably would seek to be compensated in some way for the billion that the deal includes Further complicating matters for Sierra Pacific Resources is a growing movement to municipalize the electric markets in Las Vegas and Henderson Nev On Jan the Southern Nevada Water Authority suggested that the agency could become a public power authority Pat Mulroy general manager of the water authority recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants to serve cities in the area Efforts to municipalize electric systems in the southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if Sierra Pacific Resources financial problems worsen An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most comprehensive

Wood Distinguishes Texas from California by Susan Kellogg Issues Analyst and Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis In a satellite media event on March Pat Wood the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT introduced the media to a statewide campaign of television advertisements that are part of a kickoff of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program Electric choice begins in Texas on Jun e with the start of a pilot program in which percent of customers served by Texas investorowned utilities can choose their retail electric provider REP Most other customers will be able to choose their REP when fullfledged electric choice begins on Jan After fielding questions from a bevy of television media reporters at the am broadcast Wood conducted an exclusive interview with SCIENTECH Issues Analyst Susan Kellogg on how and why the Texas deregulation plan will work why California didnt and what role the expanding renewables market particularly wind power will play in developing a vibrant competitive energy market in Texas Analysis PUCT Chairman Wood is confident that Texas has done its homework well and the states overall deregulation plan has set the stage for a successful retail competitive market When we think of Texas we think big confident independent However a comprehensive statewide group of stakeholders explored deregulation from all sidesgetting information an d advice from other deregulating states and international sourcesto make sure that Texans have a different experience with electric choice than Californians did The summary of what didnt work in California has circulated in the media for weeks but Wood has an interesting perspective on what complicated the states energy deregulation market Basically Wood says the California market worked pretty well until it stopped raining in California Oregon an d Washington In Woods opinion the fact that California is dependent for onequarter of its power supply on an intermittent source in this case hydroelectric power makes little sense and is largely to blame for the supply demand imbalance still wreaking havoc in the state The lack of power plant investment exacerbated the dynamics of the market when a critic al piece of the power supply dried up last summer Woods criticism of the California mismanagement focused on the its not m y job mentality considering that three state agencies were involved in California deregulation and yet no specific agency seemed to be in charge Bush would have run me out of Texas if we had done anything like that mused Wood Our job is to not only do our job today but to plan for the future to look ahead Granted there had been no power plant investment bu t not looking ahead with accountable facts was an inexcusable critical piece of planning missed by the California Energy Commission The perfect storm of colliding conditions that plunged California into survival mode could have been prevented The whole energy market has a less on to learn says Wood And Texas has an opportunity to practice To counteract the mistakes made Wood freely acknowledges that Texas pirated most of the infrastructure of Texas deregulation bill from Pennsylvanias largely successful plan The Texas legislature meets every t wo years for a day session Right before the session Wood and a deregulation team went to Pennsylvania and visited with state commissioners legislators industry executives consumer groups and customers to find ou t what was working and what was not in the Pennsylvania model What they decided to leave behind from Pennsylvanias overall successful deregulation strategies was the provision that allowed a Philadelphia electric affiliate to go back into Philadelphia and attract the customers away from their own utility in the name of competition Texas goal Wood clarifies is to have a market of unaffiliated companies participating whi ch will hopefully generate genuine longterm competition Yet in contrast to Pennsylvania Texas adopted a policy in which customers that do not opt to switch to a new provider are defaulted to an affiliated REP of their incumbent utility This affiliated REP which cannot be the Toperatio n of the incumbent utility will remain subject to regulated rates in its assign ed service territory although it is allowed to freely compete without price regulation outside of its service territory As a result of this policy Texasbased companies such as Reliant and TXU have submitted multiple applications to the PUCT covering separate subsidiaries that will serve different customer classes and allowing the companies to compete outside of their service territories At last count over companies had filed for certification with the PUCT to be a REP in Texas Companies that plan to be active in the Texas retail market include The New Power Company Green Mountain Energy First Choice Power the competitive spinoff of TexasNew Mexico Power Company TXU Energy Service s Sempra Shell Reliant and Enron Energy Services among others Another Texan invention was the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT the independent power grid that serves the bulk of the state and i s essentially an electrical island in the United States Not possessing multistate jurisdictions has both its advantages and disadvantages Wood sees it being a plus for the Texas energy market because of the ability to monitor the balance of supply and demand of energy flow Another feature of the Texas approach to deregulation is to make the transition easier for both retailers and operators in part by developing a seamless integration between supply and demand Perhaps most significant i s the emergence of wind power and other renewables in the state in part because of a mandate Renewables Credit Exchange that allows a retailer to buy renewable credits from a renewable operator at whatever price they agre e on In addition Texas has established the Texas Renewables Portfolio Standard Until the end of is providing a federal tax credit for companies that produce electricity from wind The deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compare d to the states that have enacted legislation for electric competition Th e key challenge for harnessing wind power in the state is to get the transmission grid to consistently and efficiently transport the power back into the main system There is a high desire for wind power in Texas According to Wood once green power programs were available in the state people jumped on board so fast that the pilot had to be put off a year so enough power supply could b e purchased Wood thinks the demand will certainly outstrip the percent mandate put into place by the state Right now constructing a wind power plant in Texas is actually less expensive than building a more traditionall y fueled power plant An ambitious mandate of having MW of renewable resources by is fueling investors interest sending millions of dollar s to Texas for renewable projects says Wood Will Wood take his lessons and leadership to Washington DC There are two open positions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which is now chaired by Curt Hbert For months it has been rumored that Wood will be appointed by President Bush to assume one of those positions When asked whether he had any potential interest in a role with FERC Wood fielded the question diplomatically Hell leave that decision to the president he said Right now Wood is focused on bringing electric competition to Texas As noted the states pilot program for electric choice begins this June with full competition starting in January With regard to population Texas represents the second largest energy market behind California offering a market value of about billion Thus many eyes within the energy indust ry are anxiously watching to see how deregulation will unfold in the Lone Star State In turn Wood acknowledges that Texas officials have been watching Californ ia closely for the last year and remain confident that the power supply problems faced there wont happen in Texas This is largely because Texas h as avoided making some of the critical mistakes made in California One important distinction between the two states is that Texas regulators have allowed for power plants to be built in about half the construction time th at has been common in other states such as California Since new plan ts have started operations in Texas generating MW By the time competition begins fully in January more plants and MW are scheduled to come online As a result Texas officials say thatunlike Californiatheir state has more than enough generating capacity to meet peak demand and provide at least a percent reserve for the next few years Th e vast majority of these new plants are fueled by natural gas with wind powe r being a supplement In addition there are significant differences between the market structure s in Texas and California First Californias structure is based on an aucti on pool which the state modeled on the United Kingdom Integral to California s system is a Power Exchange into which power suppliers submit power that th ey want to sell on the competitive market Californias PX discouraged a healt hy bilateral contract market from forming because generators could make more money selling into the PX Texas on the other hand has no Power Exchange and in fact has encouraged bilateral contracts as the way in which electric service contracts will take place In Texas customers are encouraged to establish longterm bilateral contracts with suppliers to secure the best rates which introduces the opportunity to protect them from wholesale mark et prices as customers in San Diego discovered this summer The market potential for Texas competition appears very strong which perha ps more than anything else is due to good planning on the part of Texas legislators and regulators However there are still some lingering concern s about competition in the Lone Star State First there is a shortage of transmission lines in Texas especially in the northern half of the state Although PUCT officials say that sufficient transmission lines will be put into place before competition begins without sufficient lines companies could experience transmission congestion Another concern is that Texas may be relying too much on natural gas Almos t all of the new plants that have been built in Texas are powered by this fue l source As the price of natural gas has remained high this could pose a problem for the market in Texas Hedging will be a key part of a successful strategy for any provider in Texas especially considering the rising naturalgas prices Still the espoused advantages of competition ie lower prices for endusers could fall flat if so much emphasis is placed o n natural gas as the primary power source in the state Yet ironically customers may still benefit because of the multitude of power plants within the state Abundant supply in Texas may keep the cost of power low for endusers but less profitable for suppliers Overall though Texas remains the bright shining hope for those who suppor t energy deregulation in this country The size of the states energy market will continue to attract new participants at least on the front end of the restructuring process Whether they remain in Texas and whether or not competition in the state will truly bring benefits to endusers remains to be seen An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom IMAGE The most

Develops New Wind Facility in Texas by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Enron Wind and Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI affiliates of Enron Corp NYSE ENE announced completion of a transaction in which Enron Wind will build a MW wind power facility near Iraan Texas in Pecos County Unde r a related agreement EPMI will purchase the projects electricity under a longterm agreement for resale into the Texas wholesale electricity market This will be the first major wind facility that allows wholesale customers to purchase portions of the wind power production In the past customers interested in purchasing green power were often forced to commit to percent of a projects output over the year life of the equipment Analysis I have suggested before that Texas arguably represents the most active market for wind power in the United States Enrons expansion of its wind power assets in the state should further support the growth of competition of wind power in this market as the state gears up for the sta rt of competition in January Yet while Enron Wind expands its presence in the market and prepares to sell windgenerated electricity on Texas wholesale market several other companies also have established a significa nt presence in the states booming wind power business Enron Wind a subsidiary of Enron Corp has been in existence for about years The company designs and constructs wind power facilities around the world comprising more than wind turbines and MW of capacity According to information from the company Enron Winds manufacturing facilities in California Germany and Spain develop and manufacture stateoftheart wind turbines technology ranging from kW to MW Reportedly Enron Winds MW Series turbine is the largest wind turbine manufactured in the United States and was the first of its size class to be manufactured for the global wind power market The Enron Wind wind turbine utilizes a variable speed constant frequency design and a customdesigned airfoil resulting in enhanced reliability and durability d ue to reduced mechanical loads higher energy capture and lower noise signatur e than conventional fixed speed turbines The new project in Iraan Texas which is still unnamed will consist of Enron Wind MW wind turbines and is expected to be completed by late Enron Wind claims that the project will supply approximately megawa tt hours of clean electricity each year enough to supply the annual residenti al needs of approximately average American homes Enron Wind already has one wind facility operating in Texas which is in fa ct located only miles away from the new facility in Iraan The Indian Mesa I facility is a MW wind power generating facility also located in Pecos County In July Enron Wind entered into a longterm agreement with Ci ty Public Service CPS of San Antonio to provide percent output from the Indian Mesa I facility to the west Texas utility grid Electricity produced from the Indian Mesa I facility reportedly is offered by CPS to individual retail customers such as Windtricityv which is CPS first renewable ene rgy product offering In addition to these two Texas facilities Enron Wind also has developed constructed and operated wind power facilities in Iowa Storm Lake MW Minnesota Lake Benton MW and Lake Benton MW and Californi a Cabazon MW and Green Power MW In all of these facilities Enron Wind has established longterm contracts to sell percent of the electricity generated at the wind facility to a local utility As noted th e new facility being planned in west Texas represents a new approach for Enro n Wind as electricity output from the facility will be sold in portions to a variety of wholesale customers in the Texas market Over the last year there has been a sharp increase in wind power projects in Texas mostly being built in the western part of the state At last report MW of wind generation was already in operation in the state with close to MW recently announced or planned As a result Texas is experiencing a wind boom and is well on its way toward the MW of renewable energy capacity required under the states Renewables Portfolio Standard For example last September TXU Electric Gas a subsidiary of TXU announced an agreement to purchase renewable energy from a planned MW wind farm in west Texas TXU Electric Gas share of the project will be MW The project marked the companys third major purchase of wind powe r energy Earlier in TXU Electric Gas formed a partnership with FPL Energy to build wind turbines south of Odessa Texas which will supply million kWh of electricity per year to approximately homes That project followed similar development in Big Spring Texas including eight wind turbines that are each capable of generating kW of power As an energy supplier TXU Electric Gas has obtained a great deal of its wind power by partnering with FPL Energythe largest generator of wind p ower in the United Stateswhich serves on many of the new projects in west Te xas FPL Energy is a fastgrowing unregulated power producer that is a whollyowned subsidiary of FPL Group Among the more than MW net generating capacity that FPL Energy now has the company focuses on clean technologies Wind power now accounts for about percent of FPL Energys generation portfolio The projects by TXU Electric Gas represented the largest wind power projects in the world until late August when Reliant Energy announced what it claimed to be the worlds largest single wind power installation Reliants wind power project slated to become operational in the fourth quarter of will be located on King Mountain near McCamey in far west Texas Reliant says that the project will be able to produce MW of electricity that will be sold into Texas power grid Note The Reliant wi nd project has now been eclipsed by a joint MW wind project between PacifiCorp and FPL Energy in Walla Walla Wash However I am focused only on the Texas market in this column Thus Enron faces stiff competition when selling its wind power into the Texas wholesale market Enron joins TXU Electric Gas FPL Energy and Reliant as the four companies that are vying to gain a leadership role over the limited areas of the state where the wind blows at speeds of miles per hour or higher the minimum to make a wind project cost effective Why is there so much development related to wind power taking place in Texa s A number of factors are making the state a strong market for wind The firs t factor is nature itself Texas is one of the handful of states along the Su n Belt and Southwest regions that offer an abundance of wind Some reports indicate that average annual wind speeds in west Texas are miles per hou r Second deregulation legislation in the state resulted in the Texas Renewables Portfolio Standard which until the end of is providing a federal tax credit for companies that produce electricity from wind The deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable forms of energy when compared to the states that have enacted legislatio n for electric competition The prorenewables stance is perhaps attributed t o the fact that a variety of environmental lobbying groupsincluding the Environmental Defense group and the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Associationwere included in the dialogue when Texas was forming its law In addition more efficient technology has lowered prices for windgenerated electricity while costs associated with natural gas have remained high Ad d all that to the fact that customers in the Lone Star State have a comparatively high desire for wind poweralong with other strong markets such as California Iowa and Minnesota Consequently Texas has proven to be an enticing region for companies like Enron

Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEShares in companies that make alternative energy technologies have climbed as a result of Californias latest round of statewide blackouts Shares in solar power producing companies in particular have embarked on a recent increase For instance Evergreen Solar Nasdaq ESLR recently jumped up about percent to be currently priced at representing an annual increase of percent Evergreens main competitor AstroPower Nasdaq APWR gained about percent and is currently priced at representing an annual increase of percent According to a report in Reuters James Logerfo an analyst with Bank of America Montgomery concluded that the increase is speculative buying across the energy industry Some are buying without appreciating how far away these companies are from having real products and some are building for a trade this summer They are not buying to hold the stocks for five years but for five months or five weeks Analysis Regardless of the prospectus for solar power stocks it certainly appears that solar power in general is finding a new niche as a direct result of compromised supplies of more traditional fuel sources such as natural gas Renewed interest from investors in solar power is probably a direct result of concerns about existing power supply in a handful of Western states However at the same time solar power companies such as Evergreen Solar and AstroPower also are turning in strong profits for Q which represents a positive turnaround for both companies The combination of strong investor interest and an upswing in profits indicates that solar power could be embarking on a market boom that up to only a few years ago was seen as very unlikely The question is whether the turnaround will be temporary or if solar power companies truly have found a permanent place in the sun Companies involved in solar energy typically have a business model that is founded on the technology of photovoltaics which is basically the process of absorbing photons from the sun or other light sources and turning them into electrons According to recent reports demand for solar cells grew by percent in Questions about the reliability of power supply provided by traditional utilities that have been sparked by the California situation presumably will only result in greater interest Consequently those companies that have been on the forefront of solar power research and development for years are now starting to reap the benefits of their efforts Recent financial reports seem to support this theory For instance Evergreen Solarwhich develops manufactures and markets solar power products based on its patented String Ribbon technologyreported product revenues of an increase of percent when compared to revenues of for the same period in Granted the company absorbed a net loss for Q of million as compared with a net loss of for Q However Evergreen remains pleased by its most recent financial performance which it attributes to geographic diversification and growing market opportunities for solar power The companys sales since have been composed primarily of solar panels Evergreen plans to begin largescale manufacturing of its solar power products in a new manufacturing facility this year Evergreens principal objective is to become a leading producer of highquality solar power products primarily for the ongrid market and the offgrid rural electrification market What makes the company unique according to Evergreen is its String Ribbon technology which reportedly avoids the slicing of a solid block of silicon which is required for most solarpower technologies Evergreens String Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half which reduces manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability As noted AstroPowerwhich develops manufacturers and markets PV solar cells modules panels and systemsalso reported a strong first quarter Total revenues for AstroPower were an increase of percent from Q Product revenues were an increase of percent from the same period in the previous year AstroPower is reporting continued strong performance for the company and in fact has stated that it has far more sales opportunities than it can supply There are other companies besides the two Ive mentioned that are actively involved in solar power for instance Amonix BP Solar and United Solar to name a few However the suddenly strong performance of both Evergreen Solar and Active Powerafter previous quarters and even decades of financial lossesindicates that market opportunities have opened up considerably for companies involved in solar power development and marketing So what explains the sudden resurgence of solar power which last experienced any significantly widespread interest in the late s I think there are several factors driving this renewed interest The California impact is obvious as the states energy crisis has shaken many Americans into a new awareness about a national energy crisis However I think the explanation goes deeper than that In addition to the California impact naturalgas prices are now at such a high level that alternatives such as solar power which were previously perceived as cost prohibitive now are becoming costcompetitive In addition many states and the federal government are providing tax incentives for businesses that employ solar electric systems which is making solar panels appealing to a mass market California reportedly pays onehalf of the costs associated with a solar electric system that a business establishes Illinois and Maryland are implementing similar credits The federal government also provides a percent commercial solar tax credit to businesses that employ a solar system and those businesses are also eligible for a fiveyear accelerated depreciated tax reduction Personal energy credits related to solar power were repealed in the early s but some states like California are implementing net metering policies that make it easier for residential customers to install renewablesbased generation solar and wind at their homes In any case solar power is becoming more financially feasible for businesses which is an important factor considering that most solar systems still cost between and However despite this renewed interest and projected growth the American public as a whole is still rather leery about solar power This is a sharp contrast to foreign countries especially where interconnecting to power grids is cumbersome In fact more than threequarters of the photovoltaic cells produced in the United States are sold abroad and foreign production of solar panels internationally has increased percent while US production has increased by percent There are several reasons driving the general reluctance toward this alternative form of power in this country First many still believe that solar power is not and will not become competitive with more conventional sources of electricity such as natural gas or coal As has been often repeated although the sun is free the devices used to capture it are expensive This has kept many endusers utilities and independent power producers tied to their more traditional fuel sources Another reason is that many homeowners and building associations across the country are not receptive to solar power which serves as a deterrent for potential customers that may want to use the sun to power new projects A third reason is that in most areas of the country the sun like the wind is an intermittent fuel source and battery systems that are often expensive must be used to store the power from the sun The other drawback to solar power is the lack of priority it has received from the Bush administration In April President Bush proposed cutting more than million from the federal renewable energy and efficiency research programs which support funding for solar power and other renewable projects The budget will still provide about million to solar wind and other renewable projects down from current spending levels of million However the cuts have been perceived by many as a lack of support for renewable projects by the new administration In fairness to President Bush his energy task force which is scheduled to release its energy plan this week has a potential energy crisis to solve and is focused on immediate solutions Nevertheless apart from the Bush administrations energy plan by all appearances solar power appears to be on the brink of new market interest How extensive this renewed interest will become and to what extent solar power will emerge as a viable power source alternative across the national mass market remain to be seen Also as noted in the report from Reuters investors may be demonstrating only temporary interest in solar power in anticipation of ongoing power shortages this summer However given the high prices of natural gas concerns about emissions from coal and ongoing public resistance to nuclear energy more than any other time in the last two decades solar powers future looks pretty bright An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Victorias Office of the RegulatorGeneral in Australia ruled last Thursda y that the states five electricity distribution companies must reduce averag e network charges by between and percent starting January ANALYSIS There used to be a time not long ago when utilities were strategically addressing electric deregulation by diversifying into new growth business es and in most cases many still are Concerned about the impact competition will have on the industry utilities have conducted studies and research to try and make themselves more appealing to consumers The result is a flurry of activity to diversify Some companies diversify their services in an attempt to be a onestop shopping utility Utilities across the US are offering home security systems mobile phones and other telecommunications services Then there are the rational utilities who decide to stay in the business that they know best the wires business This is due to the fact that the wires business still remains regulated at a decent return for the typic al shareholder of what was the regulated utility and will become the regulated wires company Lets take a look at some other countries that have deregulated before the US and see how their wires companies have fared First after the massive US takeover of the British utilities RECs in the British government enacted a new law in July that imposed a onetime windfall tax on the revised privatization value which originally had been computed in on privatized utilities OK so this is an anomaly It is not usually a cost of doing business in the wiresonl y environment Second in December of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets OFGEM the UK gas and electric regulatory body published final proposa ls for new rates in the distribution business and for price caps in the supply business The final proposals reduced distribution rates beginning on April of and it was not an Aprils Fool joke Third Australias state of Victoria appears to be helping set the trend of making the wires business more efficient by mandating a reduction in their rates They also ruled to set targets for different companies within the state to improve reliability by between and percent It appears this regulated wires business is getting measured by a competitive business standard In any sense lets bring it home California has becom e the summer poster child for examples in the electric industry They have an unregulated wholesale market that is spiking while the retail market in one territory is open to feel the pain price of electricity while the other areas are protected at least at the end consumer level But who eats the difference The retailer of course Well the retailer in California just happens to be the wires company incumbent service provider So while PGE is trying to figure out how to recover these astronomical gaps in what they pay for wholesale electricity and what they retail it for they may end up eating it This actually qualifies for that anomaly argument that the UK experienced because it should not be the norm In a true deregulated market wires should take care of getting electrons to customers while retailers should handle the commodity and valueadded services I know of only one state in the US that is proposing this model for their opening date Texas Can wires survive on their own You bet But I believe there are trends forming that will have to be addressed by any company focusing on a wires strategy The new wires companies will come under regulatory scrutiny to become more efficient Their rates will be reduced and they will be expected to increase reliability In other words do more with less This will mean two things One size is important Scale always produces efficiency in one form or another Second these new companies will seek efficiencies in cost savings This is one reason for the explosive growth in the supply chain and exchange areas of the utility industry Do not expect your local regulator to stick to the costplus method of calculating rates for wires This does raise an interesting question that I will save for another day How does the wires company successfully raise investment capital for improv ing its distribution system with such low rates of return DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance or Lack Thereof of Information Technology in the Energy Industry By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the CEO Mega Panel View From the Top at the th annual EEIAGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc e in Phoenix this week The moderator was Charles Bayless former chairman president and CEO of Illinova The remaining three CEOs included Keith Stamm CEO Aquila Energy Dr Matthew Cordaro president and CEO Midwest ISO and James Pignatelli chairman president and CEO UniSource Energy ANALYSIS This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner The conference organizers did a good job in getting a crosssection of the energy industry in transition The trading organization specialist was represented with Aquila the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes t ISO and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource Energy Each panelist was asked what role information technology IT played in their respective organization Their answers may surprise you Dr Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first Dr Cordaro stressed that IT was very critical to the operation of an ISO saying it is essentially the foundation of the ISO He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions every week in a realtime operation Among the responsibilities that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are monitoring the congestion on the grid and taking appropriate action preventing gaming through market monitoring settlement processing who owes who what and handling the dispute process The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati on RTO Alliance on July of this year to deliver an integrated control center system ICCS that when complete will provide million in infrastructure for the MISO The RTO Alliance which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation of Seattle Open Access Technology International OATI of Minneapolis Perot Systems of Dallas Texas and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City Utah will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission The hardware and software in the ICCS project will support MISOs operational functions including transmission planning reservation scheduling realtime monitor ing and control settlement and billing Dr Cordaro also stated that Lodestar was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to ATT Solutions Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next Keith began by clarifying Aquilas focus as trading owning very little assets in a highvolume lowmargin highvolatility business IT is very important in the trading business Realtime information must be known and disseminated appropriately to the right individuals Keith believes that one of Aquilas strategic asset s and strengths is its risk management system Aquila strives for a realtim e calculation of risk Aquila Energy a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United Inc has been a surprisin g winner in the trading marketplace this year showing a percent growth since last year with billion total revenue for the past six months of that million in trading revenue compared to million in The EBIT was million vs million a year ago Aquila has gathered top traders and intellectual financial and risk management personnel to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies including top traders AEP and Duke Energy as an investment step Aquila perceived was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin g platforms The Energy Trading Consortium Duke Energy AEP Aquila Energy Reliant Energy Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy is in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap benefits from the transaction cost liquidity volume and speed of exchange This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to onetomany Another competitor recently launched is eSpeeds TradeSpark James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial statements concerning information technology James stated that IT in the vertically integrated utility is not strategic at least not at the present time James believes that IT will become strategic someday in the deregulated market James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the IT arena He mentioned pulling in his IT folks and saying Lets switch the distribution network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances well switch back to AC While James comments may have been controversial with the more than attendees and approximately energy CIOs in the audienc e he does have a point The vertically integrated utilitys core strength is to generate power and distribute it to captive customers reliably While some IT systems like outage management and SCADA devices may be strategic in this sense the other parts of IT are questionable and could be candidates for outsourcing James claims to be working on BB and BC initiatives at the moment His vision for BC is a smart chip in the residence that has access to instantaneous pricing information The residence will buy electricity for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce load thereby reducing the TD utility to a simple conduit for service James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior to its sale to AES In Tucson Electric invested million in NEV and Charles Bayless then Tucson Electrics chairman president and chief executive officer and James Pignatelli Tucson Electrics senior vice president and chief operating officer served on New Energy Ventures administrative committee It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated IT systems If one were to stop and think about it deregulation could not occur without the complex IT systems that are employed today in the marketplace I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have thought about an unbundled electric

more about SCIENTECHs Mergers Acquisitions and Convergence in the US Electric Industry InfoGrid at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources By Jon T Brock Director Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM announced yesterday that it intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka Kansas based Western Resources WR in a taxfree stockforstock transaction The deal will require that WR separate its nonutility assets from its regulated utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders ANALYSIS In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry strategic combinations are becoming more commonplace This announcement took me by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of merger WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp United by attempting to acquire KCPL in At the time WR share price was above In WR share price soared to record highs of more than WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed They sold their interest in ADT for a million profit This profit masked a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the time was cutting WR rates by million reducing earnings by cents per share WR who obviously had a strategic focus on security used the profits from the ADT sale to purchase percent of Protection One one of the fastest growing companies in the monitored security business Protection One hit some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result their stock tumbled WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be favorable to them As a result some moved their money out of WR and by WR share price had tumbled to to In January of this year KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off the merger WR immediately split itself into two organizations regulated utility operations and nonregulated business with the intent of finding a buyer for the regulated utility operations WR claimed in June of this year that companies were being courted including international companies for the utility operations assets of Kansas Power Light KPL and Kansas Gas and Electric KGE Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me But it does fit SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba CEO of PNM just weeks ago and asked if the development of alliances mergers and acquisitions were a part of the positive approach to PNMs strategy Jeff answered Very definitely Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business and that can bring a sustainable competitive advantage are essential for us in this industry The criticality of market channels cant be overemphasized Once you have a good market channel that doesnt mean that everything you put through that market channel you have to do yourself or you have to own You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances There are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves something that is core to your business So both alliances and acquisitions will be a part of PNMs future Just weeks later PNM is buying WR Utilizing my rear view mirror now I see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM They both operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix including nuclear They both have multicommodity in electric and gas They both have wholesale operations PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part to a strong wholesale operation PNM net earnings for the nine months ended Sept totaled million or per share diluted on total operating revenues of billion compared to earnings of million or per share in the first three quarters of PNM has adopted a niche strategy in the wholesale power market by developing tailored wholesale power products for its customers While some of the megatraders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard commodity PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according to the needs of the buyer PNM has found success in this niche segment of a large wholesale market The merger deal is expected to take between and months to complete PNM will inherit approximately billion in debt making the total value of the deal worth billion Fitch has placed its securities ratings of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving Fitch plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact of the merger Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist between Wichita and Topeka This may result in a rate case It should also be noted that Wichita Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover municipalize the electric system from Western Resources within its city limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka Wichita has about power customers roughly a fourth of all the customers served by Western Resources They represent more than million of KGEs million in revenues PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has demonstrated its ability to do so PNM has decreased its debttocapital ratio from percent to less than percent in the last seven years The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque NM and the chairman president and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba Search SCIENTECHs PowerHitter archive to read about our

ecommerce has revolutionized commodity trading the AD process and procurement within the energy industry With heavyweight keynotes and indepth panel discussions this is the first event to bring the

please visit wwweyeforenergycomxonline SCIENTECH IssueAlert November The New Power Company Going Green While Stock Price Drops By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The New Power Company TNPC NYSE NPW which bills itself as the first national residential and small business energy provider announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy Inc to provide windgenerated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area Under the terms of the agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of ANALYSIS This is an interesting development especially considering that TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from PECO Energy This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain On the other hand it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company founded earlier this year by Enron along with partners AOL and IBM As you may recall just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached an agreement with PECO Energy to supply competitive default service for approximately of PECOs residential electricity customers who have not selected a competitive energy service provider Green Mountain formally challenged this agreement arguing that the PECOTNPC agreement is not in the public interest and that Green Mountain should have been awarded the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question Thus it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of wind power to its portfolio of services Up to this point TNPC has been working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers such as the approximately natural gas and electricity customers it purchased from Columbia Energy Group The acquisition of the customers in PECOs territory was a major coup for TNPC which is still in startup mode Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from PECO the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity as a provider of renewable energy Community Energy the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power that it will market began making wind power available to businesses in Pennsylvania last year TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy in fixed kilowatthours allowing for more customized service and tailored use of power Interestingly the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about MW of green power to aggregated state agencies This indicates that desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania and any energy provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green power in its portfolio Thus while renewable energy was not a fundamental component of TNPCs original business plan the company appears to be moving in this direction at least in states where it is strategic to do so However this announcement comes on the heels of TNPCs announcement of its thirdquarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price TNPCs revenues for Q were million derived from the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states Pennsylvania and New Jersey Gross profit was million or percent of revenues Yet the loss on earnings before income tax EBIT was million The net loss for the quarter was million or per basic share TNPC reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history Therefore the company contends that its yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful or indicative of future performance The companys goal for Q is to achieve revenues of approximately to million with an estimated yearend customer count of Eugene Lockhart TNPCs CEO said he was pleased with the Q performance Lockhart contends that TNPC achieved both our overall financial performance targets and business objectives and referenced the fact that the company is still building its systems and architecture so that it can continue to penetrate additional competitive markets In addition TNPC has raised approximately million in funding which the company is using primarily to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation However despite its positive outlook after TNPC made its earnings announcement its shares took a nosedive perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy providers ability to meet its objectives The shares closed last Friday at which is a dramatic drop from the average price of before the Q earnings announcement TNPC issued its IPO on Oct at a price of per share which at the time seemed quite high for a startup energy company with a limited track record A day after its opening the stock closed at per share The stock was received so favorably for two reasons in my estimation First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners among others put up about million in startup capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner of TNPC with percent control Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over customers Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock and the company is at a crossroads In order to keep its momentum on track TNPC needs to do two things First it needs to acquire additional customers to expand its base Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best opportunity to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace in those states Second as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors Consequently it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that it will be a provider of wind power This could potentially send the stock price on a upward climb again despite the fact that financial success of the company is still unproven Regarding the customer base expansion Ohio looks like the next state that TNPC will target Just last week the company filed an application with the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state Yet its clear that TNPC is still finetuning its marketing approach In Ohio it is offering customers competitive energy prices flexible payment and pricing choices and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive but there is no mention in TNPCs application that it will provide renewable energy in Ohio Moreover several questions remain Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role for itself as a renewable energy provider or it just providing wind power in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state Will the addition of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC Will TNPC demonstrate revenues of million in Q And where will the companys next acquisition of customers take place All of these questions directly impact the future success of TNPC Miss last week Catch up on

article Bright Lights A Conversation With Kevin Jordan President of Excel Energy Technologies Ltd at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml SCIENTECH IssueAlert November SmartEnergy Rounds Up million in Financing Is an IPO in the Works By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities venture capital and global banks SmartEnergy a privately held Internetbased energy service provider active in New York plans to use the funding as working capital to rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment schedule ANALYSIS You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago IssueAlert Oct when I drew attention to the fact that the online startup was taking customers away from ConEdison In existence only since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers Under a promotion currently under way in New York SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to percent on energy through the winter months for naturalgas customers in the boroughs of New York City and Westchester County Capitalizing on ongoing threats about low supplies of oil and natural gas SmartEnergy is using the socalled energy crisis to lure customers away from the traditional utility by locking in current naturalgas rates over the course of the next months under its Smart Fixed Rate plan As a policy SmartEnergy hedges the products that its sell to customers so that neither the company nor its customers is exposed to energy market price risks In addition SmartEnergy has offered United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement to secure customers As I discussed last month an advantage that online energy providers such as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers In addition operating online allows SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets Up until now SmartEnergys marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York state However the company claims that it will be serving six states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the end of this year SmartEnergy expects to be serving all deregulated states by the end of and the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support this anticipated growth Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns as the energy industry continues to become deregulated Investors that are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy WPS Resources Corporation Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors In addition there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round including Dexia Ventures the private equity arm of Dexia Bank a USD billion asset bank based in Belgium KBC Bank and venture capitalist groups Trust Capital Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures The inclusion of both American and European investors is important Coupled with SmartEnergys intention to operate in all US states that are deregulating the fact that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic The fact that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform of worldwide service In fact Alliant Energy identified the strong growth of the Internet and technology in the energy segment as a key reason why it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy In fact the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison Wisbased Alliant has been in existence for several months The utilitys nonregulated subsidiary Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy to expand a decidedly efocused business The partnership with SmartEnergy represents Alliants new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies offering stateoftheart technology and new products and services for customers In fact Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as the energy company of today and tomorrow and believes that it has a platform that can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world Of course my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy It would certainly be an obvious move for the private company to head in this direction especially now as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street Ive written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like Evergreen Solar Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid IPOs as a result of in my opinion their business models in new technologies and or alternative fuels There is arguably a general perception within the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market in the next two years With few exceptions energy companies exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several months have performed comparatively well As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid startup companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer service again resulting from its online presence Customer interaction can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet enabling account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at any time The downside of course is customer reluctance to sign up with a startup company that they may not know In addition SmartEnergy faces tough competition from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in deregulated markets including Utilitycom and Essentialcom None of these companies has yet gone public and are instead focusing on building critical mass and establishing their brand identities Yet of the three SmartEnergy may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion and could be on the fast track to an IPO in the near term SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems our experts and consultants will get results Learn more about our

Weigand Chairman and CEO of Skipping Stone is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Utilitycom Uses M Financing to Grow eUtilities Partnerships By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Utilitycom announced that it has completed its third round of venture financing raising over million Gaz de France one of the top three European gas companies led the deal Utilitycom will use funds raised in this third round to support operations as it implements its eUtilities Program partnerships which it has formed with traditional utilities in the United States and abroad ANALYSIS Financing from venture capitalists seems to be the theme of the week Just yesterday I wrote about SmartEnergy finishing its Series A round of financing in which it received million from a mix of American and European investors that included Alliant Energy as a major contributor In my analysis I mentioned Utilitycom as a competitor of SmartEnergy and argued that the latter appeared to be moving along more aggressively with a plan to become operational in all deregulating US states and across Europe About an hour after I distributed my column Utilitycom announced this significant round of financing which certainly rejuvenates its position as the worlds first Internet utility If case you are not familiar with Utilitycoms business model the company offers electricity natural gas telephone and Internet access to customers in competitive markets In fact as individual US states have moved close r to competition it seems as if Utilitycom has begun operating in all of those states Its marketing strategy has been to promote cost savings reliability and the convenience of operating online In addition with the bundled services of various offerings Utilitycom promotes a onestop shopping approach for multiple services with billing and customer service s all available online As noted Gaz de France led this third round of financing for Utilitycom It seem curious that Gaz de France would be such a primary participant in the investments but keep in mind that Europe continues to privatize its gas and electricity markets Gaz de France along with its electric counterpart EDF is investing in various energy companies to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across Europe Utilitycom of course benefits because Europe when it does privatize completely will represent a very lucrative energy market and one that could potentially exceed the US energy market Joining Gaz de France in the investment in Utilitycom are some heavy hitte rs both traditional utility companies and investors that are banking on the hope that companies like Utilitycom will start capitalizing from deregulat ion in the nearterm The list of investors is impressive Southern Company Energy Marketing Sempra Energy Trading idealab idealab Capital Partner s Trident Capital PRIMEDIA Ventures Kinetic Ventures TL Ventures Moore Capital Management and Sumitomo Corporation of Japan As noted this was Utilitycoms third round of investments and all previous investors contributed again in this round Utilitycoms relationship with Southern Company is one of the foundations on which the company was built Southern Company was one of the original investors in Utilitycom and serves as the companys preferred wholesale provider What this means is that as Utilitycom markets electricity to customers across deregulated markets the power is typically coming from Southern Company In previous discussions Ive had with Chris King Utilitycoms CEO he has reiterated that although Southern Company is a preferred provider it is not Utilitycoms only provider Southern has given us very good pricing and weve taken advantage of their scale economies being the largest energy generator in the country King told me a few months ago But we dont use them exclusively to ensure that we get competitor pricing from them If they ever give us a price that we dont like for whatever reason we can go out and get a price from somebody else It seems pretty clear that Utilitycom will use this financing to grow its unique eUtilities Program partnerships along with expanding its core operations Its eUtilities partnerships are focused on cobranding and comarketing of services with specific utility companies For instance Utilitycom has formed eUtilities partnerships with Kansas City Power and Light and FirstEnergy The eUtilities program enables Utilitycom to put together a cobranded site where it can sell energy and other related services The program also has helped Utilitycom to expand into states before deregulation has opened competition For instance in Missouria state that is still regulatedcustomers can sign up with Utilitycom and still have all of their utility services consolidated into one online package Even without savings generated from deregulation many customers are still finding value in the convenience that Utilitycom offers Just in the last month Utilitycom also began working with electric cooperatives The company formed a partnership with EnPower a consortium of member elect ric cooperatives providing energy products and services in Iowa Illinois Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota and Wisconsin Utilitycom will provide participating EnPower member cooperatives with UtilityOne an information technology and Internet infrastructure platform for utility services UtilityOne supports marketing and provisioning of multiple utilities over the Internet and serves Utilitycoms electricity telecommunications and Internet customers across the country This move follows an expansion of Utilitycoms telecommunications offerings with the introduction of Utilitycom Long Distance An introducto ry plan called Utilitycom Common Cents offers free minutes of longdistan ce service to customers for statetostate calls during the first month of service Utilitycom hopes to offer this service to customers in states by the end of this month Of course as I discussed in my analysis of SmartEnergy it is natural to speculate on whether or not Utilitycom is gearing up for an IPO When I spoke with Chris King last summer he admitted that going public is always something you have in mind when you have a company like this As Utilitycom continues to find willing investors that will support its inten ded growth an IPO would be a natural progression as Wall Street currently favors energy company stocks that are involved in technologies Utilitycom does face stiff competition of course and SmartEnergy is perhaps the leader of that group Another competitor is Essentialcom which offers a very similar service offering to Utilitycom Both Utilitycom and Essentialcom are licensed energy providers meaning that they contract with wholesale providers to purchase energy that they will resell to endusers Both companies are responsible for all forecasting and settlement issues which can be difficult when working with different states Yet one key difference that Utilitycom offers is its partnerships with utilities By partnering direct ly with utilities such as Southern Company Utilitycom by association gains the powerful brand identity of companies that energy customers already trust This is a strategy that SmartEnergy also is using by partnering with Alliant Energy As additional states deregulate it will be very interesting to see which of these online providers gain a significant market share and whether or not a large percentage of energy customers will want to conduct their utility transactions online DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

<23854411.1075859677302.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-11-16 03:36:00,Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal Learn about SCIENTECHS most popular competitive tools including the Mergers and Acquisitions Telecommunications and ECommerce InfoGrids at SCIENTECH IssueAlert November Europe May Need MW by What Generation Mix Will the Continent Use to Reach that Goal By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to be built according to a new report from Financial Times Energy The additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through but also includes Finland France Germany Sweden and the United Kingdom At the same time concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being exacerbated by Germanys plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power ANALYSIS If FT Energys projections for necessary generation additions in Europe are accurate I think there are some real challenges that the Continent will face in reaching this goal First off for perspective lets be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming Europe will need by The figure of MW is roughly equivalent to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system in Texas When we consider also that the United States consumes about double the amount of power that Europe consumes the projection that Europe will need an additional MW of new generating capacity is a staggering proposition Granted like other developed areas of the world Europes energy consumption has grown over the last two years According to data included in its report FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from terrawatthours TWh in to TWh in an increase of about percent per year While this may seem like a minimal increase it is important to note that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average For instance estimated new capacity additions through are mainly concentrated in Spain France Germany and Sweden The growth in demand coupled with market liberalization has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction or purchase of generation assets Although reportedly percent of the electricity market across Europe has been liberalized to date the Continent remains rather disjointed as it is composed of national markets that are all approaching privatization at different speeds The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their privatization movements in the early s Spain required its stateowned utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February a process that will continue through Germany decided to open percent of its market all at once in April And France resisted efforts to privatize and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European Union Consequently although Europe may in fact need the MW of new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected the type and extent to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on the energy policy of each independent nation A variety of restrictions may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount of capacity Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization and by extension its approach to generation development I cant examine the policy of each country in this forum but I think a look at Germany is warranted both because it is a major component of Europes total energy market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact the Continent as a whole Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened to competition It follows that generation coming from Germany should contribute a large percentage of the Continents future power needs However a large percentage of Germanys power has come from nuclear power but that has all changed over the last year After the Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party nuclear energy became an unacceptable energy source The German government has essentially put a moratorium on nuclear power and in fact decided to eventually shut down nuclear power plants in the country Just last month Germanys two largest power producers RWE AG and EON AG announced plans to cut output from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has developed since Germany liberalized its market The measures amount to a reduction of about percent in Germanys overall power generating capacity Moreover nuclear energy has generated over onethird of Germanys nearly billion kilowatthours of annual electricity demand and onethird of Western Europes total electricity supply As the future of nuclear power in Germany looks rather dim big questions surround what will replace nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europes energy industry Coal currently produces about percent of the power generation in Germany but as a result of the countrys attempts to lower emissions coal also appears to be on a decline Also in Germany as in the rest of Europe coalindustry subsidies will come to an end as early as making it less economical to invest in coalfired plants At the same time other countries like France are exploring cleancoal technologies but it is questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand across the Continent Generally natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will take the place of nuclear power in Europe given the seemingly abundant supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea However as demand across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases this may impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe In addition there are no effective rules across Europe for thirdparty access to private pipeline grids also putting into question the future of naturalgas supplies Also as we have seen in the United States as demand for natural gas increases so will the prices which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary power source As a result much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable energy In fact the German government wants to double renewable energy output to percent of total energy demand by using such forms as hydroelectric and wind power This seems consistent with what the rest of Europe is doing The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate percent of its electricity from renewable resources by Scandinavian countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and lowemission forms of energy with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of the Nordic regions total electricity production Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western Europe with projects in Germany Denmark and Spain ranking among the fastestgrowing in the world Again according to the US DOE wind power is projected to grow by percent per year in Western Europe This growth prospective is pretty dismal and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe Renewable energy works fine when planning overall energy needs but it rarely can be relied on to meet peak demand The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to and the sun shines when it wants to which can make peak planning based on renewable energy difficult if not impossible This being the case many critics say Europes current move toward renewable energy is completely unrealistic arguing that it would take nearly wind turbines to equal one nuclear plant In addition the growth for renewable energy is plotted over the course of ten to fifteen years FT Energy marks the year as the point at which Europe will need the additional MW of generating capacity In addition despite the fact that coalfired generation poses pollution problems it is still a comparatively lowcost form of generation This will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence of a strong worldwide commitment The US Department of Energy projects only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy through just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain a slim percent share of the total world energy consumption So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs First keep in mind that Ive focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role in Europe as a whole However the restrictions on nuclear power are not necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries For instance the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by opening a plant in Temelin The question is without Germanys contribution of nuclear power will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other power sources and other countries Although the MW goal seems very ambitious Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use of merchant plants As competition continues wholesale power buyers are demanding shorterterm contracts which in turn is supporting a growing trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent Presently only the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power but there are signs that the trend is extending to Italy Spain the Netherlands and even Germany In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear power merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europes naturalgas market Yet as we have seen in California the plant siting process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles and it is not clear if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries Plus the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily naturalgas fired which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source Moreover just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter due to our own brand of energy supply problems we are finding that the problem is not limited to our part of the world It is of course unknown if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of MW by Yet at the same time it is clear that demand on the Continent continues to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at webrciwebnsfwebDeptsIAhtml SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we

Duke Energy Offers FixedPriced Electricity Package for SDGE By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Duke Energy through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE M W electricity load The offer would establish a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for wholesale power supply for the next five years based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENA s proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in commen ts submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electric ity market ANALYSIS As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere SDGE customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity last summer and into this fall which resulted primarily from an ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California In addition other contributory factors have included the states economic growth lack of new power plants over the last decade unstable existing generation and the uncertainty of import prospects As SDGEs rate freeze had been lifted last spring customers of the utilit y were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded cents per kilowatthour compared to the cent per kilowatt hour maximum they had become accustomed to under the rate freeze The problem persists as all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices However SDGE customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for Californias other two IOUs SCE and PGE DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power for the totality of SDGEs MW electricity load In return DENAs proposed fixed rate of cents per kilowatt hour plus annual percent increases presumably will be much lower than the cost SDGE customers will continue to face without such a contract DENAs proposal has been made possible as a result of FERCs proposed order that was issued last month outlining a major overhaul of Californias energy market Since competition began in the state in the spring of the three California IOUs were required to buy their power from the states Power Exchange FERCs order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts with energy suppliers DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a very lucrative contract while at the same time attempting to protect SDGE customers from exorbitant electricity prices So what is SDGEs response to DENAs proposal I spoke with Doug Kline spokesperson for the utility yesterday afternoon Kline pointed out that first of all SDGE has not yet received any offer from DENA and that all weve seen thus far is a press release Kline suggested that it was a public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal to FERC and that ultimately SDGE would be the one to accept DENAs offer In order to speak in detail on DENAs proposal Kline said he would need to see an actual contract which has yet to materialize Kline did disclose that locking up longterm contracts for SDGE customers based on todays high prices would have to be seriously questioned by the utility especial ly considering that new generation will be coming online in California over the next few years Beyond that SDGE is fielding other offers from energy suppliers and in fact has established longterm contracts with other providers which remain unidentified for percent of the power it buys on the wholesale market Back in September the CPUC granted approval for SDGE as well as SCE and PGE to purchase percent of its power in forward markets with the other percent still coming from the PX For SDGE this amounts to MW of its total electricity load Kline said that SDGE would need to compare DENAs offer with those received or accepted from other energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDGE customers At the same time Sempra EnergySDGEs parent companyhas made its o wn proposal to FERC urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDGE customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates based on generators actual fees Under FERCs proposed order the commission suggested a soft rate cap of MWh Its referred to as soft because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid if they are dispatched but anything higher than MWh will not set the price that all generators will receive Also any generator setting a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission and presumably fall under intense scrutiny This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to as it says fix the crisis in California In fact back in August DENA offered California Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver MW of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie s and provide all three IOUs with fiveyear fixedpriced supply contracts Although Gov Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three IOUs SCE and PGE proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts with DENA Both deals were sealed within the last month although the speci fic prices of the contracts are proprietary DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state Just two weeks ago the company broke ground on a million modernization of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County The modernization effor t is projected to add MW of new capacity to sites current MW and create the states largest power plant DENA claims that when complete d the MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale electricity to serve approximately million households In addition DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to modernize and expand two other power plants in California Morro Bay and South Bay power plants DENAs motivations are pretty understandable The company may espouse good intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but realistically energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state I started to notice the trend last month as Q earnings were reported Virtua lly every company that is active in Californias wholesale market reported a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatili ty DENA was no exception As a whole Duke Energy reported record Q earnings of per share a percent increase over earnings per share of for Q The companys North American Wholesale Energycomprised of DENA and Duke Energy Merchantsposted sharply higher gains with EBIT of million a percent increase over Q According to Duke Energy s report DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power plants and from natural gas and power trading activities DENA remains on schedule to deliver approximately megawatts of new merchant generation nationally in time for summer Moreover it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENAs offer truly benefit s SDGE and its customers The proposal certainly benefits DENA however especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current high prices and includes annual increases Securing SDGE customers under these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market but how it stacks up against SDGEs other unnamed offers remains to be seen DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Issues and Analysis products and services at

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Peace Software a global provider of leading ebusiness solutions for retai l energy companies announced that MidAmerican Energy Company a supplier of energy in the Midwests deregulating market has selected Peaces Energy software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets Peace Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels services and locations on a single statement said Todd Raba vice preside nt of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy ANALYSIS This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies On the national or international stage Des Moines Iowabased MidAmerican may not be considered a major player Yet within the Midwest it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence The company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than MW of diversified power generation facilities around the world providing both regulated and unregulated electric and naturalgas services to more than million customers in six states and the United Kingdom through its Northern Electr ic Gas subsidiary In August MidAmerican made its move into Ohio the fourth largest US market in terms of customers behind California Texas and Florida indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive Midwest market Just last Monday MidAmerican became the first energy compa ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier CRES in the Cincinnati Gas Electric Co territory in southwest Ohio An essential element to the utilitys growth is a comprehensive billing software system which is where the value of Peace Software comes in According to MidAmerican it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a basis Also important to MidAmerican as it enters different states is the elimination of several automated and manual processes required by our current system This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software In this particular case Peaces Energy software will provide to MidAmerica n customers several selfserve features including customer enrollment summa ry billing more flexible due dates and electronic payment options The Energy System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting The last two features are particularly noteworthy as up to this point they have been rarely found in billing software Many systems in the United States today are building this competency or are bolting on the technology Peace already offers it in a onestopshop tool Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra cts prior to this one with MidAmerican including Enron BC Gas Dominion Retai l Nordic Electric Exelon Energy and Pepco Services The company is based in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin New Zealand the first country to deregulate its electric utilities I spoke with Brian Peace CEO of Peace Software last June and he gave an overview of how the Energy System functions First the Energy System is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another Since its start in Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multipleproduct architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water gas and electricity into one product suite Currently the system handles not only those three commodities but also can consolidate billing information relat ed to telecommunications home security home mortgaging and other valueadded commodities and services The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing At the time of our discussion Peace said ESPs can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore Theyve got to be able to buy it at the right price combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers This is the path to being competiti ve and profitable Over the last decade Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand market and began selling its technology in the United States in That same year the company secured a contract with Enron which at the time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California retail market Of course Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin g efforts in California but still uses the Peace Energy software as it continues to penetrate other markets Peace Softwares alliance with InSITEa New Yorkbased application service providerhas led to providing the softwar e for the billing needs of Exelon Brian Peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers Of course although Peace Softwares contract with MidAmerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market the billing software business presents stiff competition Perhaps the two greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy SCT offers the SCT Banner product which was originally created to bill multiple commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well ENLOGIX uses the SCT Banner system to support multiservices across its client base including gas financing ancillary products electricity water and solid waste Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and Australia Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets Peace has entered the Canadian gas market by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas headquartered in Vancouver which serves about customers Excelergy has implemented its billing product at Boston Gas which serves about customers As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multifaceted billing and customer care system Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the valueadded service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line Obsessively Relentlessly At Your Service The company is obviously making customer service a centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite to support its entry into new markets

Pennsylvania Customers Continues to Go Green By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company reported that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the Competitive Default Service Agreeme nt between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost customers The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few days ANALYSIS As you may recall a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount ain about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energys service territory Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately residential electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service provider registered within the state This represented about percent of PECOs residential customer base Three energy providersTNPC Green Mountain and one other unidentified companybid for the customers with various service packages PECO chose TNPC which had offered a fixed discou nt of percent for the residential customers because it believed the offer was in the best interest of PECO customers Green Mountain contested this decision arguing that its hydro and natural gasbased energy package would ultimately be less expensive for consumers and environmentally cleaner Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed offer was a full percent less than PECOs shopping credit compared to TNPCs offer which would average about percent below the shopping credit PECOs response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer Over the last month both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECOs customers which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most successful retail market in the United States if not the world The PUC ruling clearly puts the PECO customers into the hands of TNPC which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing alliance between Enron AOL and IBM Securing the residential customers in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the Pennsylvania market The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not shopped for an alternative supplier under the states electric competition program However what I find most interesting about the latest development in this case is whats happening behind the scenes of the dispute and more specifically how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective I discussed just two weeks ago IssueAlert from Nov that TNPCs stock NYSE NPW was taking a nosedive Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in early October TNPCs IPO offering of million common shares was priced at per share a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has only been in existence since May of this year Momentum grew as the first day of trading saw the stock price climb to Yet contrast that with the current stock price of as of Nov and certainly questions about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge The decline in TNPC stock seemed to start when the company reported a Q loss of million or per share TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due its limited operating history but investors seemed to think otherwise Around the same time that TNPCs stock began to drop the company announced that it would be adding windgenerated energy to its package for customers in the Philadelphia area Under terms of a brandnew agreement TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen t in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania My reaction to this announcemen t was that TNPCs addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt to quell further objections from Green Mountain Yet TNPCs move toward renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock price In another ironic twist TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh ip with Green Mountain which was an adversary only last month TNPC disclosed that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition of up to competitive default service customers out of the within PECOs territory Reportedly the relationship will benefit Pennsylvania consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals In addition TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner is consistent with its objective of enhancing a positive customer portfoli o value However considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of the customers from PECO it seems odd that the company would sudden ly be willing to share of them with Green Mountain Certainly Green Mountain wins from this partnership The company gains residential customers when it based on the PUCs ruling could have ended up with nothing The company offers three service packages in Pennsylvania EcoSmart EnviroBlend and Natures Choice varying mixes of hydro natural gas and new renewables with Natures Choice containing more renewables than the other two power blends Marketing power that it bills as dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy What remains very unclear is TNPCs true motivations and the future of the company which made such a big splash when it began operating last spring Is this a classic case of an energy startup chasing down trends eg the current high value of renewable energy stocks in order to rejuvenate itself or a true identity transformation The questions are pertinent as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to struggle DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Learn more about SCIENTECHs Strategic and Competitive

IssueAlert December Rumors of Eni Enron Merger Abound Despite Denials from Eni By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi ng the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countri es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will repre sent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europ e to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billi on cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decisi on is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merge r strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategi c contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas tradin g and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci al endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japan s first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals includin g Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan ies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

effective Oct BPA which sells power produced at federal hydroelectr ic dams and a nuclear plant has signed contracts for about MW but has generating capacity for only MW To help make up the MW shortfall BPA is pushing a plan to idle the regions aluminum smelters for two years until additional generating capacity comes online Analysis Given the barrage of media coverage that continues to hang over Californias energy problems the fact that the Pacific Northwest is suffering from its own related maladies is often overlooked Perhaps the mo st extreme case that illustrates the severity of problems to the north of California is the BPA which in addition to attempting to increase its wholesale rates by as much as percent this fall is now unable to fulfil l many of its longterm power contracts Much like Pacific Gas Electric and Sierra Pacific Resources before it the BPA now stands among a handful of power firms in the West that have sustained devastating financial blows due to volatility of the regions market However unlike investorowned utilities IOUs BPA is owned by the federal government and as such has be en criticized for having access to federal funding and protection not extended to other Western power victims It is important to remember that BPA is a federal organization that was formed in to market power from the Bonneville Dam It holds a lock on approximately percent of the Pacific Northwest power market and is one of the primary providers of power to incumbent utilities in the area such as Tacoma Power and Seattle City Light In the s the BPA experienced

aluminum manufacturers However these contracts have aggravated regional power problems in a new era of shortages and soaring prices For the most part BPAs troubles have stemmed from weatherrelated circumstances unlike California and Nevada where weather has served to exacerbate fundamental restructuring problems The Pacific Northwest whic h relies heavily on hydropower has suffered one of its worst droughts in recent history which has greatly compromised what has typically been a reliable and abundant power source In fact the Northwest is reportedly between MW and MW short of the power it needs Further power that the Northwest could typically rely upon from California and the Southwest to supplement any shortage it might encounter in its own territor y is no longer available due to power demands in other states Given its role as the primary power supplier to the regions utilities the BPA has become increasingly vulnerable to the volatility of the spot market The end resul t is that BPA which clearly overextended itself regarding power contracts formed in the last decade has been forced to either buy expensive power on the spot market to serve its customers or negotiate buyouts of its power obligations The BPA also has traditionally sold power directly to industrial customers and over the last few months has attempted to rescind many of those contracts For instance the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company a Kalispell Montbased aluminum manufacturer has agreed not to use average MW of the average MW BPA had agreed to sell it from October to September Reportedly the BPA has bought back the power under contract to Columbia Falls for MWh This marked the second industrial customer that has allowed the BPA to terminate a power contract following a deal wi th Alcoa another aluminum producer in which the BPA bought back about average MW Typically the Ccustomers have agreed to break their contracts with the BPA due to their own halted production schedules that have resulte d from soaring power costs However aluminum production is a critical part of the Northwests economy and several lobbying groups have emerged to block the BPA from negotiating with any additional aluminum manufacturers to cease production Arguing tha t the BPA has an obligation to fulfill its power contracts the advocacy groupscomprised of public power and manufacturing representativesF attempting to secure some form of legal restriction against the BPA before the agency increases rates this fall Without knowing the terms of the contracts it is not clear whether BPA has an exit clause that entitles it to stop providing power to the various buyers Regarding its Northwest customers which are given priority to BPA power supplies the BPA has requested that these utilities implement conservation programs to reduce the amount of power that must be purchased on the wholesale market Nevertheless the BPA has already disclosed that it will be forced to increase rates by as much as percent this October to cover it s spot market power purchases a condition that echoes similar movements by PGOand Sierra Pacific Resources BPA reportedly charges its utility customers about MWh for electricity Wholesale electricity on the spot market is now selling at between to MWh and wholesale power sold through longterm contracts sells for to MWh Consequently the percent increase could be the minimum at which the BPA raises its rates which would in turn impact the retail rates that Northwest utilities must charge their customers PacifiCorp recently became the first IOU under contract with the BPA to voluntarily reduce load on the federal agency Under the agreement PacifiCorp has released BPA from its commitment to sell the utility an average of MW each year for the next five years Other IOUs are not acquiescing to the BPAs proposal For instance the BPA informed Southern California Edison SCE that it would not provide MW of power this summ er to the utility under the terms of a previously reached agreement The BPA which unilaterally changed the terms of the contract from a strict sales agreement into an exchange when SCE began to have its own financial problem s has argued that SCE has ceased providing needed power to the BPA As a result the BPA will provide no further power to SCE unless it receives financial guarantees in advance SCE has deemed this threat as a potential breach of contract and is currently pursuing the matter in the th Circuit US Court of Appeals Moreover the crux of the matter presently is the dichotomy that BPA represents in a deregulated energy market On one hand BPA is a federally protected agency with access to federal funding and control over federal lands On the other hand BPAunlike any other federal agencycontrols about half of the Northwests energy supply and in the past has profited from power sales to other regions mostly California In addition to the growing resistance from public power and aluminum groups ov er BPAs plan to increase rates other groups have raised the claim that BPA i s receiving preferential treatment from the federal government Some critics find it inconsistent that the Bush administration supports free market principles in the West evidenced by the resistance to put wholesale price caps into place and increased production but at the same time might allow BPA to break longterm power contracts Such critics mostly clearly represented by the NortheastMidwest Institute a nonprofit Washington DC think tank believe the Bush administration should force BPA to sell its power to anyone who wants it at freemarket rates which of course are consistently higher than its current costbased rates In addition to potential rate increases the BPA is attempting to secure increased funding from the federal government As a federal agency the BPA is allowed to borrow from the federal treasury to support infrastructure upgrades such as transmission capacity and maintain federal dams that generate the BPAs power Recent reports have indicated that the BPA alread y is spending around billion in federal funds to modernize the regions power grid and will request an additional million from the federal treasury for transmission upgrades and to modernize existing powergenerati ng facilities Yet at the same time several regional groups are attempting t o block any increase in the BPAs access to federal funds arguing that the administration has continuously lowered its annual payments into the treasu ry and therefore should not be entitled to a credit increase The BPA may not have directly caused the current power problems in the Northwest but it is clear that the federal agency engaged in overly optimistic power contracts that it now cannot fulfill Moving forward the question will be whether or not in a supposedly deregulated market the BP A should be governed by any special standards given its status as a federal agency or whether it should be held to the same rules that apply to IOUs While the forprofit economy of the Northwest is now in jeopardy due to volatile power prices stakeholders in the region object to the BPA being able to break contracts and increase rates Once again this appears to be another matter that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Bush administration to decide as part of the nations unfolding energy agenda An

Analysis IMAGE With California facing a summer of anticipated power outages Gov Gray Davis and President George W Bush met for approximately minutes on May to discuss the states energy crisis in general and a federal cap on wholesale energy prices in particular Davis did not win any concession during the brief meeting in which he reportedly reiterated his contention that Texas energy producers have engaged in price gouging in California In fact after the meeting Gov Davis said On the thing that really matters above all others price caps Im disappointed that we still have a fundamental disagreement Analysis For once its rather easy to imagine myself as a fly on the wall during this muchanticipated meeting between the nations leader and the leader of the nations most populous state The firmly held positions of both President Bush and Gov Davis have been so well defined and articulated over the last few months that it is not hard to speculate on how their brief conversation unfolded Unfortunately their positions are currently so far apart that any compromise on the key issue of Western wholesale price caps shows little chance of being reached Once again the issue appears to be headed to court with Gov Davis having now confirmed that he will bring suit against FERC Meanwhile what was previously perceived as Californias problem has now become a national concern and one of the issues if not the main issue on which the political reputations of both Bush and Gray currently depend For clarity and to establish why compromise is so unattainable lets crystallize the philosophical gulf that exists between Bush and Davis Although the issues surrounding Californias energy crisis are complex the main issue on which Bush and Davis disagree is rather simple price caps or no price caps Gov Davis claims that Californians have been unfairly charged nearly billion since January and acknowledges that his own plan to keep Pacific Gas Electric Co out of bankruptcy failed The governor also pointed to a record price of MWh that the state paid for power last week compared with an average price of MWh in the spring of Thus Davis wants the Bush administration to enforce federal law by making FERC put wholesale price caps into place for a period of six or seven months long enough to get past the summer power crunch The temporary price cap also would allow for the four power plants that are already under construction in the state to come online FERC already has instituted a price cap for times when Californias power reserves fall below percent but Davis has argued that this approach is not sufficient Davis argument is based on the belief that FERC has not fulfilled its federal obligation to ensure just and fair electricity prices In an interesting development Davis has gained some influential support regarding his plea for price caps from a consortium of ten economists including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn generally considered the father of deregulation In a letter sent to the president late last week Davis and the group of economists claimed that FERCs failure to act soon on the issue of price caps will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back potentially fatally the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country In contrast President Bush along with Vice President Cheney maintain that price caps wont solve the power shortage and in fact would only do further damage to Californias power problems as price restrictions would discourage further production In addition Bush has argued that the core of Californias problems is a supply demand imbalance something that price caps would do nothing to solve Vice President Cheney has said that price caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply resulting in more blackouts for California this summer Further Bush has argued that California officials including Davis predecessor Pete Wilson are responsible for the states power woes and that the only real solution is a combination of increased supply and conservation efforts The subtext of the Bush administrations approach to the California power crunch is that the problem can be solved in time but not with temporary bandaids Under the recently released federal energy plan President Bush has outlined a plan to increase power supply over the next years fueled by traditional and nontraditional sources Bushs approach to California is that in time increased production and transmission capacity upgrades will rectify the states current supply demand imbalance Affixing temporary price caps according to Bush would do no good and could cause a great deal of damage While touring California President Bush announced a proposed expansion of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which provides special help to cashstrapped residents of California and other states Funding of this program which requires congressional approval would increase by million adding to the alreadybudgeted million Gov Davis again responded that this measure was inadequate and reiterated that all California wants is for Bush to invoke the federal power that only he has as president and provide shortterm relief to the state Gaining momentum for Bushs travels in California Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham weighed in on the California debate on May Abraham stated that the states problems were not just a result of insufficient supply but also related to poor transmission capacity As such Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration a federal agency to finish its pending plans for increasing capacity along the socalled Path an mile stretch of power lines that presently is insufficient to carry the necessary load between Northern and Southern California Bottleneck problems along Path have been cited as a main cause of power outages in the central part of the state Remaining at issue is whether or not there will be enough funding to support a new transmission line along Path Of course politics continue to play a key role in this ongoing saga Both Bush and Davis have seen their approval ratings dip as a result of the power crisis and are seeking redemption and a place to transfer blame A Field Poll released last week indicated that President Bushs approval rating in California is at percent percent disapproving points behind the national average Gov Davis approval rating in the state is also at percent with disapproval coming in at percent a sharp decline from more favorable ratings held in January In addition remember that President Bush lost the state of California in Novembers election by as much as a point margin or more than one million votes It is also reported that Gov Davis may make a play for the presidential election in Further Davis has publicly singled out a handful of power suppliers such as Reliant and Enron which are based in Texas the presidents home state Now that any sort of compromise appears unlikely between California and the Bush administration Gov Davis has confirmed that he will pursue legal action against FERC hoping to force it to honor rulings that electricity prices in California were unjust and unreasonable Further Davis indicated that the US Senate soon to be Democratcontrolled would hold hearings into the soaring prices and perhaps be more responsive to the states claims The California State Legislature already has filed a suit against FERC claiming that the federal commission has failed in its efforts to stop what it already determined were unjust and unreasonable wholesale prices Nevertheless on May the th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to order FERC to cap wholesale prices in California responding to a sideline claim issued by the city of Oakland and two California legislators The threejudge panel of the court ruled that the appeal did not warrant intervention on the part of FERC However this ruling does not directly impact any additional lawsuits that are pending or might be filed Keep in mind that FERC continues to apply pressure on California to join RTO West the regional transmission organization that is overseeing transmission in the Pacific Northwest California officials have maintained that they want the California ISO to remain independent Consequently California and FERC may reach a deal sooner than Gov Davis and President Bush as a tradeoff between price caps and California joining RTO West could become the muchsoughtafter compromise On the record FERC officials share the Bush administrations opposition to price caps but Chairman Curt Heacutebert has previously indicated that he is open to the use of price caps as a temporary solution An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

last week Catch up on the latest deregulation competition and restructuring developments in the energy industry with SCIENTECHs IssuesWatch IMAGE IMAGE June Power Shakeup in United Kingdom American Companies Divest as the Brits Expand in the United States By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEBritishbased electricity generator International Power announced th at it is buying a MW coalfired station in central England from TXU Euro pe for million pounds million as part of its expansion in Britain International Power which spun off last year from privatised British utili ty National Power said it expected the MW Rugeley Power Station near Birmingham to increase earnings and generate cash in the first year of operation The Rugeley deal includes a tolling contract until the end of under which TXU Europe part of TXU Corp NYSE TXU will provide coal for the plan and purchase its output Analysis TXUs sale of its Rugeley plant is part of the companys European strategy to expand trading operations and focus on the retail business acro ss the Continent Divesting the coalfired plant in central England while sti ll remaining involved in a tolling agreement with the plants new owner strengthens the balance sheet of parent company TXU Corp and streamlines t he companys European operations so that it can become more focused on profitable ventures such as trading However it is also important to take TXUs sale of its UKbased power plant in the context of several other transactions that are brewing in Britain all of which forecast a major shakeup in the countrys power playing field Further while American companies based in the United Kingdom reevaluate and divest their holdings in Britain UKbased companies continue an aggressive and profitable expansion into the US market Clearly International Power is a British company that is more squarely focused on the traditional generation market than TXU Europe For instance International Powerwhich also has interests in Australia southeast Asia the United States and across continental EuropeFa worldwide gener ation capacity of about MW Thus acquiring additional generating assets in its home country makes sense for International Power which by the way has outperformed its Londonlisted electricity company peers by more than percent so far this year In contrast divesting the Rugeley assets seems to be a strategic move for TXU which has been in the process of divesting other European assets over the last six months In February TXU Europe announced the sale of its North Sea assets which was the first indication that the company was movin g away from a hardasset strategy across the Continent The company had bough t stakes in several North Sea gas fields as part of its expansion into Britains energy business However the divestiture of these assets was initiated out of TXU Europes desire to concentrate more exclusively on trading operations in Europe Consort Resources a UK startup company th at also operates in the North Sea has agreed to acquire TXU Europes upstream gas business located in the region for million In addition to divesting its North Sea gas business TXU Europe also announced in February of this year that it is seeking to sell its percen t stake in Spains Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico Following the planned divestitures TXU Europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading This is understandable as the company has quickly become o ne of the major forces in the trading market since a number of European countries have opened their electric and gas markets to competition upon t he directive of the European union In fact TXU Corp reported a percent jump in revenue for Q which it attributed in large part to its energ y trading business both in the United States and the United Kingdom where revenue more than doubled However as noted in addition to furthering TXUs own European strategy t he divestiture of the Rugeley plants is also part of an emerging game of music al chairs in the UK power market In addition to a change in business model many American companies may be looking to sell their UK power assets in response to Britains intense regulatory scrutiny of energy profits and the application of the countrys windfall profit tax In other words companies such as TXU may find that any value in holding onto UK assets may be overshadowed by taxes enforced by the British government In any case TXU is not the only American energy company looking to divest UK assets For instance ScottishPower the Glasgow Scotlandbased utili ty that owns PacifiCorp in the United States is reportedly holding talks with Entergy Corp about purchasing Entergys two UK gasfired generation assets Damhead Creek and Saltend According to some financial analysts th e two plants which have a combined capacity of about MW could earn Entergy as much as billion a figure that seems awfully high Similar to TXU Entergy is looking to divest the UK generating assets to support its thriving wholesale trading business As a sidenote the possible sale o f Entergys UK generating assets was cited as one of the factors that contributed to the companys failed merger with FPL Group earlier this year Just like International Power it would make sense for ScottishPower to increase its asset base in the United Kingdom The company has reportedly increased its retail supply business in England and needs to hedge the cost of selling power in the country In addition to possible interest in Entergys UKbased gas plants it has also been reported that ScottishPower along with potential partner Southern Energy not to be confused with Mirant Corp which was formerly known as Southern Energy ar e also interested in Seeboard a regional UK electricity company currently owned by American Electric Power AEP Moreover this growing interest in Seeboard also represents another critica l component of the UK power shakeup Seeboard serves around two million connected customers in England in the towns of Kent Sussex and Surrey Under its brand name of Seeboard Energy which combines electricity from Seeboard and gas from Beacon Gas a joint venture with BP Amoco the compa ny sells dual fuel to customers throughout the United Kingdom Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables and along with consortium partners also manages and operates the electricity distribution system serving the London Underground Again AEP as Seeboards current owner is looking to divest the company in order to focus on European power generatio n marketing and trading Up until a few weeks ago it appeared that Electricite de France EDF was the leading contender to acquire Seeboard Having previously purchased Lond on Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales and a supplier to approximately two million customers in metro London it w as a smart move for EDF to further expand its base in the United Kingdom with additional acquisitions Through its London Electricity subsidiary EDF mad e a billion pound billion offer for Seeboard which AEP rejected However as recently as last week it was still up in the air what will become of the Seeboard assets The last word is that London Electricity continues to negotiate with AEP but the American company reportedly faces a multimilliondollar tax bill if it sells the UK assets before June According to a report in Reuters AEP now claims that it will proceed with the sale only if EDF assumes the tax bill associated with the sale of Seeboard As noted while American companies continue to reevaluate and divest their UK electricity assets British companies are taking full advantage of deregulation and power supply concerns in the United States I already mentioned the fact that ScottishPower is looking to expand beyond its ownership of PacifiCorp with further acquisitions of American energy companies Portland General has been named as a strong possibility In addition UKbased National Grid aims to become the premier transmissi on operator in the United States Toward that end National Grid has been aggressively acquiring US companies that are consistent with its emphasis on the transmission and distribution business For instance National Grid is currently in the process of acquiring Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc NYSE NMK an upstate New York energy services company Niagara Mohawk is the third acquisition that National Grid has made in the United States and all three purchases have been of utilities based in the Northeastern part of th e country In National Grid purchased New England Electric System NEES and Eastern Utilities Associates EUA which provided National Grid with strong transmission and distribution assets in Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshire Of course the UK company Powergen completed its acquisition of Louisvill e Kybased LGOlast December which has helped the British company to establi sh a presence in the Midwest market Powergen has acknowledged that it continu es to look for additional US companies to acquire Further the Bush administrations plan that calls for new energy productio n efforts has opened up new windows of opportunity for British companies to further expand in the United States In addition to any acquisitions that i t might make in this country ScottishPower also reportedly plans to construc t new MW power generators in three US states Also British Energy a UKbased nuclear power supplier hopes to capitalize on plans to increase nuclear power in the United States with the sponsorship of new nuclear plan ts taking advantage of President Bushs call for tax subsidies for nuke plants Note also that British Energy formed a partnership with PECO Energ y creating AmerGen that is in the business of purchasing power plants In addition given ongoing concerns about naturalgas supply in the United States British gas companies such as BG Group British Petroleum and Shell are reportedly looking into the construction of gasfired plants in this country All of this makes for a very interesting dichotomy as American companies continue to divest their power assets in the United Kingdom while British companies acquire further holdings in this country An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive

and Republicans since the November elections not for seven years as was incorrectly stated in the column We apologize for any misunderstanding that this error might have caused IMAGE IMAGE May EDF Pursues Italys Montedison Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEPower giant Electricitde France EDF has sent shock waves through Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise its stake in electric firm Montedison to percent from about percent However Romano Prodi the European Union commissioner for competition is considering an intervention in the battle between EDF the French electricity monopoly and the Italian government The latter has passed an ad hoc law restricting EDF to percent of the voting rights for Montedison the Italian electricity supplier spun off by Enel Analysis Once again the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the European power market with EDF playing the staring role For the last year or so as the European Union EU has enacted electric competition across the Continent Frances EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by foreign suppliers Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through its ownership of London Electricity the French power firm has wanted for some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy However the neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market As I have mentioned before in this column France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country As a result EDF which controls approximately percent of the French electric industry may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad until it further opens its own market to competition To date France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the EU and EDF has played a large role in this resistance While other European countries such as Germany have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although other companies such as Spains Endesa have attempted to push through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country Nevertheless EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its holdings in Montedison one of Italys main electricity companies Reports are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison EDF recently said that its stake increased from percent to percent However other reports have indicated that EDF already controls about percent of the capital assets of Montedison Both increases in Montedison were made recently which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market regulatory Consob EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the companys financial assets across Europe However at the same time EDF has also indicated that any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading purposes In other words EDF wants to control the generating assets of Montedison for resale across Europes wholesale market Further with a percent stake EDF would become Montedisons largest shareholder and a major presence in Italys power market even as France remains mostly closed EDFs argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian government The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators In fact EDF has admitted that its strategy is to make percent of its turnover from activities abroad by the end of compared with percent currently Consequently it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its home country for expansion opportunities and these opportunities typically have been in distribution and generation assets Moving forward the company has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation For instance last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for the regional UK electricity company Seeboard which is owned by American Electric Power NYSE AEP Serving about two million connected customers in England Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables An acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDFs overall expansion efforts in Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales which EDF bought from Entergy in In addition EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden Graninge and Germany EnBW and reportedly is Polands largest electricity distributor These acquisitions were made by EDF International which is wholly owned by the French government and thus subject to EU oversight Perhaps due to EDFs size and presence in Europe these previous acquisitions were allowed without a great deal of EU intervention However now that other countries have voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede it is unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny As noted trading appears to be the next wave of EDFs expansion efforts Toward this end EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in to create an energy trading company called EDF Trading The various companies that EDF has invested in across Europe support the companys efforts to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across the Continent For its part the Italian government has responded that it will block any increase of EDFs ownership of Montedison based primarily on the argument that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France Specifically Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison Further outlining its position the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be sold by Enel one of the countrys main power firms As Montedison will be one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel the Italian government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and thus having access to additional power assets in Italy For instance Enel is planning to sell Elettrogen a generation company that produces about percent of the production capacity in Italy If EDF were to increase its stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen then EDF as a foreign entity would gain a lock over the Italian power supply market Italys antiEDF law is an interesting development but it does not mark the first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent Spain also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with regard to the French companys pursuit of Hidrocantabrico Spains fourth largest supplier However despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict any expansion of EDF the laws although they are already in place may ultimately be deemed anticompetitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates antitrust allegations in the United States any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles EDF also remains interested in the Spanishs largest power utility Endesa which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the French electricity market through a percent acquisition of French electricity generator SocieacutetNationale dElectricitet de Thermique Endesa which recently terminated an attempted merger with Iberdrola Spains second largest power firm has been viewed as a takeover target for larger companies such as EDF At last report the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on how far control was being exercised In other words EU intervention will be based on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an increased stake in Montedison The fact that France remains resistant to electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the governments of Italy and Spain An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North

National Competitor or Master of Its Domain By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEAt an annual meeting of shareholders on May Southern Companys NYSE SO new CEO Allen Franklin said the company will become a dynamic growing superregional energy company that emphasizes customer service and shareholder value In addition to maintaining and improving its annual dividend of per share Franklin disclosed that moving forward Southern Company will implement a new business strategy which focuses geographically on serving states in the socalled super Southeast Franklin also noted that the new strategy concentrates on Southern Companys regulated retail business which represents percent of the companys business Analysis Two recent and significant events at Southern Company set the stage for this pronouncement of a new strategy for the energy company based in Atlanta The spinoff of its highly successful Mirant Corp NYSE MIR six weeks ago and the simultaneous retirement of former CEO Bill Dahlberg which led to the appointment of new CEO Franklin make the timing right for Southern to reestablish its vision in the industry However it seems to me that there is not much that is new about Southern Companys recently unveiled business strategy which primarily focuses on growth within Southeast US states In fact for the last decade Southern has kept its regulated operations squarely focused on its service territory put little emphasis on US expansion and contributed to the Southeast regions general reluctance to deregulate Yet now even as national energy competitors grow larger and larger Southern Companys strong local presence and vertical integration approach may ultimately prove to be the smartest strategy of all It was only four years ago as the first group of deregulated markets began to operate that Southern Company billed itself as a pound gorilla implying that its number of customers and generation assets represented a formidable challenge to any other electric operation in the nation This was a view that was shared by most observers Before consolidation and mergers and acquisitions began to accelerate it was generally thought that Southern Company was the energy operation to beat in terms of scale and market prominence However the energy industrys playing field has changed dramatically since that time Now Southerns stats MW of generation million customers and market capitalization of billion are trumped or rivaled by the likes of AEP and Exelon companies that also span a much wider operational base than Southern Company Granted Southern Company has not sat around idly over the last four years and let competitive opportunities pass it by Mirant Corp formerly Southern Energy has been quite aggressive on a global and national scale Yet this formerly unregulated subsidiary of Southern Company is now a billion standalone company that is still riding on the glory of a strong IPO current MIR shares are priced at as of May following its October IPO price of Now Southern Company proceeds on its own with a strategy that is in many ways a recycling of what has been a slow growth but successful formula for its regulated operations The company says it will focus on its five regulated utilities Alabama Power Georgia Power Gulf Power Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric and unregulated power generation and energy products in the Super Southeast The focus on unregulated power generation through which Southern reportedly plans to add another MW by most likely refers to subsidiary operations such as Southern Nuclear and Southern Company Energy Solutions Moreover Southern appears perfectly content to maintain a strong local presence gain a healthy dividend on its regional utility operations and hold uncontested market power throughout its service territory Who could blame them This has been a lucrative business model for the company for some time Southerns Q earnings excluding contributions from Mirant were million or cents per share compared with million or cents per share in Q Further the company holds an exemplary relationship with customers receiving the highest ranking in overall customer satisfaction according to a recent study and local regulatory commissions However this business model should not be referred to as a new strategy Southern Company has always been a superregional operation with its own profitable niche that remains clearly defined The difference nowin addition to expanding from four to states in the same regionis that Southern may very well be on the right track and positioned to have the last laugh as the deregulation game continues to unfold As noted one of the consistent criticisms of Southern is that it has remained too focused on its service territory of the Southeastern United States and through this prominence in the region has prevented other companies from penetrating Southerns region This is a criticism that has also been leveled at Duke Energy Southerns neighbor to the north which has a lock on the Carolinas FERC recently rejected Southerns proposed SeTrans Gridco the companys proposal for a regional transmission organization and told the energy company not to reapply until it had explored joining neighboring utilities in an RTO such as GridSouth and GridFlorida which have already been conditionally approved by FERC This was a clear message to Southern that it would not be allowed to operate as its own electric island Of course FERCs policy is that transmissionowning utilities should voluntarily participate in an RTO but at the same time the commission would have control over Southerns market power in the region should the energy company ever want to merge with or acquire another utility Ironically just as Southern has maintained market power in the Southeast it has taken advantage of opportunities from deregulation in other states On the wholesale side Mirant is one company that has witnessed a financial windfall from California In addition Southern Company is now moving into Florida its first expansion outside of its service area after receiving preliminary approval to build a MW naturalgas generation facility in Orlando Further Southern Companys dominance in the Southeast has often been cited as one of the causes of the regions general sense of lethargy when it comes to electric competition None of the four states in which Southern is currently active Alabama Georgia Florida and Mississippi has formally adopted any sort of restructuring plan Generally these states have decided to take waitandsee approach although this philosophy actually predated the California energy crisis Granted insufficient transmission lines leading to the Southeast and the uncertainties about whether or not regulators will allow the costs associated with transmission construction to be recovered also have contributed to the lack of competition in the Southeast However regardless of the causal factors the end result is that Southern Company holds what is perhaps the largest uncontested market share in the country Consequently after being criticized and questioned for its rather conservative and restricted approach Southern Company now sits on the sidelines of a growing energy crisis from which it is remarkably immune As a growing number of states consider a return to regulation and industry analysts debate the prudence of deregulating the energy industry at all the trend may be returning full circle to a market structure that Southern Company has consistently exemplified In hindsight the business model that Southern has steadfastly pursued is now hard to criticize considering the uncertainty of many other national markets For instance Southern retains a solid customer base that is in little danger of being penetrated by competitors Mirant has successfully spun off as its own standalone company with the ability to attract investors based on its strong capital appreciation Southern Company also remains a strong operation with a solid rateofreturn and dividend for shareholders attracting its own set of investors The companys vertically integrated model has been retained and there have been no indications that Southern Company faces a supply shortage Expansion into other markets such as Florida and California has expanded Southerns base while at the same time the company has held on to its market share in its own region For all of these factors Southern Company may prove to have one of the smartest strategies across the electric utility market Southern probably wont become a national player as utility operations of comparable size clearly aspire toward However it arguably has never been part of Southerns strategy to be a national player beyond what it achieved through Mirant when the company was still a subsidiary Focusing exclusively on the super region of the Southeast appears to be providing a remarkable rateofreturn for Southern In closing the companys strategy reminds me of the tortoise and the hare story While other companies have rushed to merge grow bigger and expand across the country Southern has taken a more methodical approach which may also get it across the finish line before many other competitors An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility

federal government is optimistic that Enron Corp NYSE ENE and the Maharashtra state government will resolve their wrangle which has jeopardized the US energy giants billion power project Indian lenders want their federal government to intervene after a threat by Enron Corp the countrys largest foreign investor to walk out of a giant power project has put the loan of the Indian groups in jeopardy Local lenders including the Industrial Development Bank of India and the countrys largest commercial bank State Bank of India stand to lose billions if Enron pulls out the deal On May Enron took a major step toward pulling the plug on the project by issuing a notice to terminate its contract to sell power to the Maharashstra state Analysis This news item is significant for two reasons First Enrons ongoing troubles in India are causing other power companies to also scramble from their investments in the country or avoid India altogether This comes at an unfortunate time for the undeveloped country as it was hoped that the investment from Enron and other companies would provide a significant financial boost to Indias energy infrastructure Second it is rather ironic that Enron which has gained an earnings boon from its wholesale and trading activities in the United States has faced financial challenges overseas by following the one business strategy that it has mostly avoided in this country owning hard generation assets By way of background Enron was first approached by the Maharashtra government back in regarding the joint development of a new power project to serve the western part of India In the mids Enron broke ground on the MW project on Indias western coast near Bombay which is the capital of Maharashtra that reportedly will be the largest natural gasfired power project in the country upon its completion Some reports suggest that it is the largest naturalgas plant in the world The plant is in the midst of its first operational phase with MW up and running and is scheduled to begin its second phase MW in June The company that owns and operates the power project is Dabhol Power Company in which Enron holds a percent interest the state of Maharashtra owns the other percent Under terms of the contract the state of Maharashtra agreed to purchase the totality of power produced at Enrons plant However problems began to surface over the last six months or so heightened by Maharashtras recent default on payments to Enron Dabhol Power has been criticized for charging rupees per kilowatthour compared with the markets average of rupees for conversion purposes equals rupees Citing what it claimed were high costs charged by Dabhol the state of Maharashtra reportedly refused to pay for any power produced from the second phase of the Dabhol plant At last count the state government owes Enron approximately million for power transactions completed last December and January and could owe million if the contract is terminated Citing payment defaults by the state of Maharashtra and noncooperation from both the state and federal government in India Enron issued a preliminary notice to terminate future power sales from its Dabhol plant Enron also declared a state of force majeure a legal strategy that allows a company to break a contract for reasons beyond their control In response Indian leadersdriven by valid concerns about the financial repercussions that a broken contract would haveare requesting the countrys federal government to intervene and prevent any break in the contract Lenders such as the State Bank of India the countrys largest commercial bank also plan to fight Enron on its plans to rescind the contract As noted Enrons problems in India are causing a damaging domino effect for the undeveloped country Being the international energy giant that it is Enron probably wont suffer too much if it does indeed terminate its contract with the Indian government and perhaps can find another buyer in the country for the power produced by the Dabhol plant Enron also has reportedly pulled out from all of the other projects in India in which it had once planned to invest including Metgas a liquefied naturalgas pipeline and Indiabased projects led by Enron Broadband Services and Enron Oil Gas This ongoing divestiture in India should reduce the companys risk exposure related to the countrys instability On the other hand the failed contract will most likely do a fair amount of damage to the energy market in India which is already perceived as a less than lucrative country in which to develop power projects Some reports have indicated that India received only billion in foreign investment in representing three times less than Singapore a country representing only onefourth of the economy of India Any deterrent toward further power expansion in India would exacerbate concerns about the countrys ability to meet growing demand for electricity Further at least four foreign power companies Cogentrix of the United States EDF of France Powergen of the United Kingdom and Daewoo Corp of South Korea already have pulled out of the Indian energy market At the same time many domestic companies also have postponed their own power projects as a result of legal obstacles In addition to a tainted reputation Indian leaders also stand to lose financially as well as loans given to the Indian government reportedly are not covered by any guarantee unlike overseas lenders who are protected by guarantees Enrons announcement that it intends to terminate the contract has triggered a cooling period that will last for six months during which time the Indian federal government will continue trying to convince Enron to maintain its end of the contract Interestingly in early May Enron said that it had no immediate plans to sell its stake in the Dabhol power project and added that it would make no move on the plant until the payment disputes with the state of Maharashtra are resolved Other statements made by Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay have suggested that the company might continue to own the Dabhol project and proceed with the completion of the second phase regardless of any payment that Maharashtra may or may not make Given the sharp increase in demand that is expected in India it would make sense for Enron to want to retain its majority ownership of the power plant and work a deal to sell its power to another Indian buyer Enron has been fairly consistent with regard to its strategy of not owning hard assets on any longterm basis Typically Enron has accumulated infrastructure in various commodities eg electricity generation natural gas bandwidth in order to ensure that it can provide a product where the customer wants it However once Enron has established itself within that commodity all it really needs is access to the infrastructure rather than outright ownership so divestiture has typically followed The company might have perceived the Indian market to offer unique opportunities due to the lack of infrastructure across the country However now it appears that Enrons majority ownership in the Dabhol plant may be causing more for the company than the assets are worth The possible termination of the Dabhol contract with the state of Maharashtra would mark the third sales deal that Enron has broken in recent months Most recently the company announced that it is bowing out of billion project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates and has sold its stake in Dolphin Energy to UAE Offsets Group for an undisclosed amount In addition Enron is being sued by a group of California universities over the schools claim that the company breached a fouryear contract signed in to provide power at a percent discount to the utility rate frozen by Californias deregulation law Scheduled to expire in the deal between Enron and the California university system included a peak power load of MW and is estimated to be worth about million Although Enron cited problems associated with Californias energy crisis once in court the company disclosed that the contract with the California universities no longer represented an economic business strategy and that the company was actually losing money on the contracts although it would not confirm a specific amount An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

closed today in Albuquerque Over the past three days the conference focused on the changes that deregulation will continue to necessitate alongside the IT side of the energy industry As various software and customer management companies identified their unique service offerings in the exhibit hall of the conference an important dialogue exchange also occurred that highlighted new trends and challenges that utilities and retail companies will continue to face with regard to customer care At the conference I spoke with executives from a good number of the companies that are directly involved in the CIS space including Excelergy Peace Software LODESTAR Orcom Enlogix and Itron among many others Through these conversations several common denominators emerged that highlight a list of key drivers that will continue to shape this market The CIS space has become intensely competitive over the last two years and will continue to offer additional opportunities for new business models In the exhibit hall over companies were featured some of which have been around since before deregulation and others that have just emerged within the last year or so The vast majority of the companies represented fell into one of two categories software license companies or operations that offer total customer management support on an outsourced basis In particular we are finding that companies capable of multiservice offerings across multiple verticals electricity gas water waste management etc have a market edge over competitors that are more squarely focused on a single commodity In addition opportunities for CIS implementation appear to be far greater in Europe and Asia when compared to North America Although activity in North America is expected to increase many of the companies I spoke with are currently more aggressive across Europe and Asia The debate over software licensing versus outsourced customer management support continues within this segment of the energy industry A utility or retail operation basically has three choices build its own CIS modify existing legacy system purchase bestofbreed capability software licensing or outsource the full customer management Much of the decision between software licensing outsourcing lies within the business model that the utility or retail company has established for itself and its own capability of managing customer data without external support Many customer management support companies would offer that as retail operations begin to expand into various markets the complexities among various state regulations require outsourced customer management support Certainly the cost investment is another key factor driving the CIS decision made by a utility or retail company Many energy companies are hesitant about CIS and customer management implementation because they fear the system will become obsolete in three to five years and the company will be forced to write off its investment Consequently most energy companies are aggressively searching for an offtheshelf product that is adaptable and can be expected to still be around in years if such a product exists The overall hesitancy to invest in a CIS solution is part of the explanation why only a handful of significant contracts among utilities and software license companies outsource companies have been announced to date Within the various business models utility operations have a different approach to CIS Generator companies which typically have less than customers have a primary need to store customer information that is easily accessed and therefore do not typically need a largescale CIS However wires and retail operations are the key markets for advanced CIS and CRM platforms Wires companies which need to administer the data for a large number of customers need CIS systems that focus on work management outage processing and billing of either enduse customers or market participants Wires companies only have a need for CRM if state law allows marketing by the incumbent wires affiliate of the utility This trend may subside in time as more retail operations assume the responsibility for marketing Like wires companies retail operations also need to administer the data for many customers The requirements of retail operations focus on commodities plus valueadded products and services Within the systems employed by retail operations innovative and robust pricing applications are a must Retail companies also use CRM systems in which market intelligence sales automation campaign management and customer profiling are high priorities EDI will be replaced by XML As the transition is made from legacy systems to fourthgeneration client service solutions XML will replace for communicating large complex documents and information This process is currently taking place and will most likely continue for the next year or so XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible However the future remains open and it is anyones guess what will eventually replace XML California has thrown a real scare into the IT industry nationwide Most of the CIS executives present at the conference agreed that the uncertainty of deregulation that emerged as a result of the California crisis has cast a pall over the nearterm future for CIS opportunities As other states possibly slow down or abandon their restructuring plans many software and outsource companies admit that this could have an impact on their business and the CIS market as a whole A number of factors impact whether or not a company operating in the CIS space would be impacted by a return to regulation These include limitations put into place by legislative and regulatory bodies the business model of the company and its technical capabilities to operate in both a deregulated and regulated environment Ironically despite the slowdown new competitors continue to emerge mostly based on the belief that the need for a new CIS is building under pentup demand and will break soon In addition the renewed emphasis on power supply as included in the Bush administrations energy plan has positive IT implications according to some of the attendees at the conference As more power is produced and delivered to enduse customers the need for data management and billing solutions also increases Other trends that will continue to drive the CIS market include The rapid growth of the Internet as the primary form of communications media FERCs Order which is sparking the continuing emergence of RTOs ISOs transcos The simplified rate structures will make it easier to bill a transmission tariff The business lines among utility companies will become more clearly separated and consolidation among the lines will most likely occur This separation and consolidation process will impact the opportunities available for CIS companies the available market will shrink Retail customers will be turned over to new entities outside of the incumbent utility which will also impact CIS opportunities Outsourcing efficiencies should improve which will heighten the ongoing debate between software licensing or outsourcing full customer management support Moreover attendees at the CIS conference generally agreed that customer relationship management begins with effective management of the customer as its core Customer management includes the millions of transactions that must be accurately recorded bills that must be disseminated recovered and stored and competitive customer data that is critical to a the operations of a utility or retail company As deregulation not only opens up new opportunities for the companies operating in the CIS space it also is forcing these companies to become more flexible adaptable and opening to forming partnerships that would have seemed quite unlikely in past years Consequently the CIS market continues to change at a very rapid pace and it is hard to predict what players will become visible at next years th Annual CIS Conference One thing remains clear however As the complexities of customer billing and management become more intense the role of software providers and data management outsource

American Power System b y RDIFT Energy is now available from SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March California Regulators Approve Massive Rate Increase Who Benefits and Who Doesnt by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis California regulators earlier this week approved electricity rate increases topping percent the largest in the states history The California Publ ic Utilities Commission CPUC voted unanimously to raise rates by cents KWh The rate hikes which take effect immediately but wont appear on customer bills until May apply to millions of customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric the states two largest utilities Lowincome residents are exempt from the increases Analysis For context keep in mind that it was only two months ago that th e CPUC approved its first rate increase in response to the staggering debt of SCE and PGOand other factors related to the California energy crisis In early January the CPUC approved temporary rate hikes of percent for residential customers about a month for the average customer and to percent for businesses The temporary increases were only to remain in effe ct for days and will be expiring shortly At that time both PGOand SCE denounced the temporary increase which was not surprising considering that the to percent increase was much lower than the utilities had requeste d PGOasked for a percent increase and SCE had asked for percent The January rate increase was followed by an additional percent increase tha t is set to take effect next year The CPUCs current ruling increases rates by about percent at SCE and percent at PGE However the CPUCs measure will most likely serve to benefit the state more than SCE or PGE The CPUC clearly established that none of the additional revenue earned from the rate increases can be used b y the utilities to pay for past power purchase costs which have amounted to about billion In addition the CPUC adopted a proposal by consumer gro up Toward Utility Rate Normalization TURN that a rate cap preventing the utilities from charging market rates should be extended In other words th e portion of the electric rates that PGOand SCE actually receive from ratepayers will remain frozen for the foreseeable future The CPUC has established that the utilities must still recover billions of dollars in stranded costs before the rate freeze can be lifted Thus it appears that most of the revenue accumulated from the rate increas es will be used to reimburse the state of California for the power purchases i t continues to make on behalf of the utilities and will not be used to pay of f any existing debt held by the utilities PGOalready has responded that the CPUC ruling attempts to completely change the ratemaking rules that are us ed to determine the end of the rate freeze under AB PGOhas said that it will challenge this and other aspects of the CPUC ruling However even though most of the money from the rate increases will go to t he state it is also not presently clear if the increases will be sufficient t o reimburse California for the billion it has already spent to procure power or compensate for the anticipated billion that it will have to p ay for power this year Some of the funds generated by the rate increases must be used by PGOand SCE to pay for power that they still obtain from supplier s or to cover costs for their own power generation Consequently the CPUC ha s left open the possibility that additional rate increases may be necessary Although it is still being evaluated how individual customer classes will b e impacted by the rate increases it is fairly clear that large commercial an d industrial customers will end up paying the most Loretta Lynch president of the CPUC maintained that an underlying goal of the increase is to force what she referred to as electricity hogs or those people who excessively use power without concern for the states supply shortage to conserve Lyn ch has said that conservation is the key to staving off additional rate hikes and that the higher rates should put financial pressure on Californians to conserve energy which theoretically should help to reduce the risk of blackouts in the state this summer The average residential cost for a kilowatt hour is about cents for SCE customers and cents for PGOcustomers The new rate increase will add about cents KWh for the customers of both utilities which as noted averages out to about a percent increase at SCE and a percent increase at PGOfor electricity alone However Lynch also established that a tiered pricing structure which ha s yet to be fully determined will be put into place The tiered pricing syst em will reward customers who conserve energy and penalize those who do not Essentially this means that those customers who use the most power will ultimately pay the most and could face additional rate increases this year which the CPUC did not rule out as a possibility Under a tiered pricing structure those customers who conserve on their power usage may not see their bills increase beyond the rate increase approved this week The CPUC also ruled that PGOand SCE must pay small independent generators i n the state known as qualifying facilities for energy within days of delivery Over the last week California has again issued Stage emergencies signaling that power reserves have fallen to dangerously low levels Contributing to the problem is the fact that QFs have stopped producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of PGOand S CE and the fact that they have been paid only a small percentage of what they are owed for power previously produced Under normal circumstances the QFs can generate as much as percent of the states electricity needs The CP UC ruled that PGOand SCE must pay the QFs within days of the end of a billi ng period or suffer from penalties equal to the amount of their outstanding payment Gray Davis who throughout his tenure as Californias governor assured Californians that rates would not be increased attempted to distance himse lf from the CPUCs ruling and in fact issued a statement that he has no contr ol over the commissions decision Further Davis said that the rate increase was premature because the state is still evaluating the financial numbers that are needed to make a sound decision In turn the CPUCs Lynch criticized both the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC for failing to act on energy rates up to this point In addition to its comments regarding the rate freeze PGOresponded with a mixed reaction to the CPUCs ruling on the rate increase On one hand the utility said the ruling offered a welcome dose of realism However the utility also said that the rate increase does not offer a comprehensive solution fails to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even creat e more instability Based on previous statements that PGOhas made the utili ty believes that the states fundamental problem has its origins in the wholesale market where prices have often exceeded MWh Some power generators many of whom have been lambasted by California and federal regulators for alleged price gouging went on record with a favorab le response to the rate increases Jeffrey Skilling Enrons CEO said There s been a need to balance supply and demand in California and to date I don t think anyone has been willing to let the prices rise to help balance supply and demand So the increases are a huge step forward in reducing the odds of shortfalls Keith Bailey chairman and CEO of Williams told Reuters that he thought the CPUCs rate increase was a rational decision and something that the industry has been suggesting for some time Naturally many consumer activists reacted vehemently against the rate increases and protested during the CPUCs proceedings The main argument of the consumer groups is that the CPUC the governor and FERC have not fulfilled their regulatory responsibilities in bringing down electricity prices in the state and have not acted with enough force to restrict what they perceive as excessive prices for power owned by outofstate generator s This position gained momentum last week when the California ISO reported th at electricity wholesalers overcharged state utilities by billion over th e past months Consumer groups also continue to oppose any sort of a bailout for PGOand SCE and believe that the utilities have hidden money under the protection of other subsidiaries within their parent companies Both utilities maintain that any financial restructuring activities they ha ve implemented have been legal Moreover while the rate increases may help the state to continue securing power on behalf of the utilities other fundamental problems related to the states energy crisis remain unresolved The CPUC has asserted that part of the benefit of the rate increases is to keep the utilities financially solvent However at the same time the commission clearly states that none of the extra revenue generated by the rate hikes can be used to pay down th e utilities outstanding debt Consequently although the higher rates should significantly increase revenues for both utilities billion a year for SCE and billion a year for PGE all of this money apparently will be turned over to the state and do little to alleviate the utilities own financial problems This issue still remains unresolved and under the domai n of the state legislature However the likelihood that PGOand SCE would nee d to declare bankruptcy remains strong unless additional rate increases or securitization takes place In addition other fundamental problems such a s the supply demand imbalance in California and the related volatility of t he states wholesale market continue to wreak havoc on the markets stakeholders While the CPUCs rate increases may be a positive step toward stabilizing the states financial the future remains quite uncertain for PGOand SCE An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

Industry Analysis The AES Corporation NYSE AES announced that it has completed its acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises the Indianapolis Indbased utility wit h MW of generation and customers in and around Indianapolis IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange of shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be exchanged for shares of AES common stock IPALCO common stock was suspended from trading at the close of the market on March Analysis The purchase of IPALCO an established and respected utility in t he Midwest will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an d further the companys aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid e of its business AES already owns CILCORP an energy services company whose largest subsidiary CILCO serves portions of Illinois and Missouri Note that pursuant to an SEC order AES will restructure andor sell its ownersh ip interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an exempt holding company under PUHCA Thus through the purchase of IPALCO AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has established In addition from this purchase we now know that AES along wi th being a global player intends to remain dominant throughout the United States as well Further the acquisition represents a rather bright development for AES considering that the company has recently encountered some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California First lets examine the value of AES acquisition of IPALCO Certainly th e MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow

the Past Two Weeks by Bob Bellemare Vice President Utility Services US Electric Power of Point Lookout New York announced plans to construc t a megawatt MW coal fired power plant at Cherry Point in Whatcom Count y Washington Just last week Reliant Energy Seward LLC a subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced it is planning on constructing a MW circulati ng fluidized bed CFB cleancoal power plant in Indiana County Pennsylvania Analysis As the United States awakes from its energy policy slumber it i s becoming increasingly apparent that the days of near complete reliance on naturalgasfired generation to meet our growing energy needs is coming to an end According to EIA statistics natural gas prices have risen to histori c highs with January utility deliveries exceeding MMBtu compared to and prices which floated between and MMBtu Virtually overnight natural gas has gone from one of the least expensive generation fuels to one of the most expensive Since the January price spike prices have settled back down to the to MMBtu level for Henry Hub futures prices but even these prices would have been considered high just twelve months ago Coal by comparison is the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves Coal price s have actually dropped for utility deliveries over the past several years according to EIA statistics In coal prices averaged shortto n MMbtu compared to shortton MMbtu for second quarter Although coal generation currently represents over percent of US generation production few plants have recently been built because of the environmental concerns associated with coal generation and the relatively l ow price for natural gas throughout the s In US coal production actually declined by percent which was primarily attributable to a larg e drop in coal exports coupled by smaller than usual growth in coal consumpti on for power generation But brighter days may lie ahead for the coal industry New socalled cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed In the s and s the pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor PFBC was developed removing sulfur SO pollutants and limiting the formation of nitrogen oxi de NOx pollutants inside the boiler The need for scrubbers or other postcombustion controls was eliminated by technology Texas New Mexico Power TNP constructed two MW lignitefired units that went operationa l in and based on the circulating fluidized bed CFB technology th at Reliant is proposing for its MW facility in Pennsylvania The TNP One power plant was however extremely costly to build Unit cost million kW and Unit cost million kW to construct Another technology being developed is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More than percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada In the early s PSI Energy and Destec teamed up to construct a MW IGCC generatin g unit at the Wabash River Project in Indiana for a total installation cost o f million kW In TECO completed the construction of its MW IGCC generating unit at Polk Power station in Florida for a total installation cost of million kW Japan has also experimented with cleancoal technologies In Hokkaid o Electric Power Co Inc started commercial operation of a MW PFBC power plant Test operations are being carried out at two other plants the MW unit of Chugoku Electric Power Co and the MW unit of Kyushu Electric Power Co Japan is also testing a pilot scale MW molten carbonate fuel cell MCFC at a Chubu Electric Power Co site It is interesting to note that these advanced technologies have historicall y approached the installation cost of a nuclear plant but have all the operational costs of a coal plant Now market conditions have changed and despite the high capital and operating costs cleancoal technologies can economically compete with naturalgasfired generation if gas prices continue to remain high Additionally expectations are that the next generation of cleancoal power plants will cost significantly less than the early pioneers cost The Department of Energy DOE for example assumes an IGGC power plant can be built for kW with an average heat rate of BtukWh in its Annual Energy Outlook report The DOE deserves a great deal of credit for bringing cleancoal technology to the point of commercialization In the cleancoal experiment began i n response to the USCanadian transboundary problem of acid rain In March of President Reagan agreed to a new billion publicprivate initiative to make cleancoal technologies a reality The program led to projects in states including cofunding demonstration projects such as the PSIDestec and TECO facilities In the mids the only options for reducing NOx pollution cost per ton todays low NOx burners have reduced this cost to under ton These low NOx burners have also reduc ed emission levels from parts per million ppm in the early s to ppm today Furthermore the Selective Catalytic Reduction SCR process reduces more than of the NOx contained in coal combustion gas The DOE reports that percent of all coalfired capacity in this country is now outfitted with lowNOx burners Similarly the cost for scrubbing technology which removes sulfur pollutants has been reduced percent since the s The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most important technical issues for coal power plants because of its high carbon content The latest commercial plant has achieved a thermal efficiency of percent by increasing steam temperature and pressure Even with these improved efficiencies the coal power plant of the future may still be unab le to achieve the substantial greenhouse gas reductions that could be necessar y to address global climate change concerns There are other existing environmental regulations that may also limit the adoption of new coal generation The SIP Call rule requires Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce NOx emission by a specified amount by May with muc h of the reductions expected to come from coalfired power plants In the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment estimated at billion per year particulate and billion per year ozone respectively The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules and recently supported the EPAs right to regulate these emissions see IssueAlert at wwwConsultRCIcom These rules are significant since they will lead to additional NOx and SO emission reductions the two precursors to fine airborne particles Mercury reductions are also being contemplated In November the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for Clean Air Act violations In a settlement with TECO TECO agreed to cut NO x and SO emissions by percent by and pay a million civil penalty But in the end the nation will likely turn to coal to help meet its growin g energy demands Great strides have been made to reduce the environmental impact of this abundant fuel source Since the use of coal has more than doubled while emissions of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants have decline d by percent and percent respectively If we can continue to achieve even greater emission reductions coal may well help provide the energy bridge to the future An archive list

take a stake in Britains fourth largest power utility Powergen NYSE PWG at a price percent above current levels According to the German paper Handelsblatt EONs supervisory board reportedly will make a final decisio n in the next week Powergen meanwhile said it is still in talks on a possible offer from another company There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer being made for the company Powergen said in a statement The company first announced that it was in talks to be purchased on Jan Analysis The word that EON Europes second largest power company would buy a stake in Powergen at a fat percent premium of around pounds increased Powergens British stock price by as much as percent to reach pence A combination of the two companies would create a power firm on par with Europes largest power companies Frances EDF and Italys Enel Since talks about a potential acquisition by EON surfaced in January Powergens stock price has climbed percent In addition according to Reuters Powergen jumped to the top of the gainers list for the United Kingdoms FTS E blue chip index On March Powergen stock reached pence while t he FTSE index was down percent at month lows Powergen also trades in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange where Powergen shares opened March at If the rumors about Powergens price tag are true EON would end up paying more than nine pounds a share or six billion pounds US billion for the UKbased Powergen which carries a debt of about billion pounds These projections exceed previous reports from financial analysts who suggested that EON would pay no more than eight pounds a share for Powerge n EON might be feeling increased pressure to finalize a deal with Powergen since other players such as Scottish Power have also expressed interest in the company With significant capital to spend Reuters reported up to billion including proposed divestitures EON reportedly believes that Britain where demand is outpacing the rest of Europe is the best country in which to begin a rapid expansion strategy Despite the fact that Powergen h ad previously acknowledged that it was working on a deal with EON over the last week it has maintained that discussions continue with other companies EON formed as a result of last years merger between Veba and Viag supplies Germany and Europe with electricity heating natural gas water a nd petroleum Germany which opened percent of its energy market all at on ce in April has undergone a period of rapid consolidation As a result the largest power companies in the country have begun seeking competitive opportunities across the Continent this is a growing trend in Europe as companies from other countries are following the same competitive strategy EON must expand outside of its home country where analysts have speculate d that core profits in its generation business have become unstable In many ways consolidation is a means of survival for EON as Europe continues to liberalize and electricity prices fall as a result Powergenwhich generates about percent of the electricity used in Eng land and Wales and has electric and gas operations throughout Europe India Asi a and Australiais a company that became known for its global expansion efforts especially in the United States Just last December Powergen completed a billion acquisition of Louisville Kybased LGOEnergy Cor p Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market as a result of consolidation that had taken place in the United Kingdom The acquisitio n of LGObecame appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which was thought to support any further expansion that Powergen might have had in mind Powergen has a market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of according to Yahoo Finance However the company has struggled over the last year Powergens primary subsidiary LGOEnergy saw its profit for decline by percent to million from million As the parent company Powergen saw its profits decline by percent in to million from million although its revenue increased percent to billion up from billion in Keep in mind that Powergens acquisition of LGOwas not completed until December so LGEs earnings will be reflected fully in its parents financial report starting this year If EON were to acquire Powergen it would gain several strategic advantage s EON would no longer be reliant solely on the German market where falling prices and continued consolidation limit competitive opportunities In addition the purchase would give EON a hold on generating assets in the United Kingdom and the comparatively lowcost power production millio n customers and various business operations that LGOoffers in the United States As noted Powergen has acknowledged that it has received approaches from E ON and other companies Based on available reports those other companies ar e most likely RWE Germanys largest power supplier and a rival of EON Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise French megautilities and an unnamed American power company Enron or Southern Energy would be my best guess However word from its management team is that Powergen is not interested in getting tied up as a purchased entity in merger or acquisition proceedings at thi s time as it may be planning additional purchases of its own in the United States On the other hand the rationale for Powergen to be sold to a company like EON is taking shape British restructuring law has forced large generators to sell power stations to reduce any likelihood of market power As a resul t Powergen has morphed from a pure UK generating company to a broadbased company engaged in telecommunications gas and distribution services Ed Wallis Powergens CEO has stated that presently it has become very difficult for Powergen to compete with larger rivals in an enlarged Europea n market As noted Powergens strategy over the last year has been one of further expansion in the United States and the purchase of LGOwas perhaps more expensive than Powergen had planned In order to make further US acquisitions Powergen needs adequate capital or equity in order to finance the acquisition something that has become more difficult since its purchas e of LGE Nevertheless if the deal takes place it will require regulatory approval i n the United States from FERC the SEC and the Kentucky Public Service Commission among other possible agencies The climate for US energy industry mergers and acquisitions has become rather turbulent in recent weeks Three highprofile mergers Entergy FPL Group Con Edison Northeast Utilities and Sierra Pacific Resources Portland General have a ll encountered difficulties that could derail their pending deals In addition according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal announced worldwid e mergers and acquisitions this year totaled billion as of March which is about onethird of the volume during the same period last year Also about merger deals have been withdrawn from the market compared with deals that were withdrawn for the same period last year according to the WSJ report Analysts that have been closely watching the potential for an EON Powerg en deal say that Powergens US operations in LGOcould prove to be a major stumbling block for the two companies and that EON may find US regulato ry requirements to be much more stringent than those in Europe Specifically the SEC has strict rules regarding what kinds of companies can own public utilities a category into which LGOfalls and EONs diverse nonpower operations may send some red flags to American regulators Consequently although EON appears rather confident that this deal will be completed rather soon Powergens reported resistance and US regulatory obstacles m ay thwart this yettobeformallyannounced partnership An

of electricity and naturalgas marketing giant Enron Corp NYSE ENE slid further on Thursday March amid broader weakness in energy stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year Enro n was off or percent at on March after falling percent on March So far this year Enrons stock is down about percent vers us a percent decline for Standard Poors utilities index and a percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average Analysis Over the last several weeks a growing number of smaller emergin g energy companies have felt the impact from the nations struggling economy and the likelihood of an impending recession Just recently startup companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have withdrawn their IPO plans citing an anemic stock market and the lack of positive cash flow A look across the stock market can send shivers down th e spines of most energy company CEOs as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below the point for the first time in two years and the Nasd aq composite remains percent off of its March high of putting the economy in bear market territory However while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies may crash and burn the giant energy company that is Enron Corp typically has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the US economy Over the course of Enron shares returned percent and traded at roughly times trailing earnings reportedly more than times the multiple of its some of its main competitors or the S Nevertheless Enrons winning streak in the stock market may be eroding as the waves that are crashing around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same whirlpool For perspective Enrons closest competitors across its various business lines Williams and Dynegy also appear to be taking the hit from the bear market Williams NYSE WMB saw its stock decline or percent to on March Dynegy NYSE DYN saw its stock drop or percent to Of course of the three companies Enron wields the highest PE ratio at and largest market capitalization at billion By comparison Williams has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion while Dynegy has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion Analysts that keep a close eye on Enrons stock say the sudden decline is n ot a reflection of any new business developments at the company but rather a market that is struggling in general and a growing disenchantment among investors in technology and telecommunications in particular This may be having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron g stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the telecommunications broadband market Just as the company has achieved unparalleled success in electricity and naturalgas trading for the last year Enron has been developing a highspeed broadband communications networ k to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing Enron projects a billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi ng and services by and the valuation of its own broadband business at a share or billion The company plans to trade excess bandwidth capacity and in order to do so is constructing its own network which cost s a lot of money Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between billion and billion in assets over the next months in order to reduce debt and support the new business in broadband among other businesses in pulp and paper data storage and advertising Thus much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business and Enrons role in it Up to this point confidence in both the industry a nd the company have run high Some analysts have reported that interest in Enrons expansion into this area validated by investor interest in new technologies in general drove an percent rise in the companys share price last year Yet once again the tide may be turning Investors no longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not resulted in bottomline profits much as the year before ecommerce stocks also found that their day in the sun ended rather abruptly And although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold its broadband business has remained immature In fact for yearend Enron Broadband Services reported a million IBIT loss reflecting start up costs to build the new business The company seems to have anticipated the slow growth of its broadband business In fact Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a nd six years for the companys naturalgas business to develop standardized contracts and increase liquidity Skilling has said that these numbers do n ot dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe r for the company While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t he broadband business investors may not be as patient Note that while Enron s broadband business took a loss for the company as a whole reported a percent increase in earnings per diluted share to and a percent increase in net income to billion In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for to between and per share In response to the sudden drop in stock price an d speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom e profitable Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it remains ver y comfortable with the earnings estimate An Enron spokesperson also ma de references to information in the market that is inaccurate suggesting th at any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded including potential layoffs at the broadband unit According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom investors polled by First Call Thompson Financial ar e still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of to for Nevertheless despite Enrons reassurances that it remains on track to meet its earnings estimate the companys stock continued to drop As noted investors began to put downward pressure on the stock pushing it to as of March below its week low of and far below its week hi gh of Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai n unclear about what it is that Enron does exactly According to a March article in Fortune magazine entitled Is Enron Overpriced some Wall Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money and the lack of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enrons pricey stock The skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enrons thunder in a bull market b ut that could all change quickly in a bear market Enron may in fact exacerbat e Wall Streets distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its financial records for what it deems competitive reasons The Fortune report which was published before Enrons stock began to decline also indicated that investors are concerned about Enrons debt Although the company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load Enron carried a net billion debt at the end of September Again although investor s may have been able to look the other way from Enrons debt during a strong economy it appears that investors will use a finetooth comb to examine th e companys financial records during the increasingly unstable economy Moreover in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog y and telecommunications stocks investors may also be concerned that a globa l economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole resulting in lower commodity prices Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly validate this theory Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of problems with its broadband unit Looking at the big picture it appears reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i n Enrons stock Rather Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o f several factors Yes investors appear to now be less likely to support new technologies and telecommunications businesses that have not proven to be presently profitable In addition Enron is in many ways an enigma In an unstable economy the uncertainty surrounding Enrons business could prompt an unprecedented hesitation about the companys business model And lastly Enron is not alone among energy stocks and stocks in general that are weathering the fallout of the stock market On the bright side Enron still remains a very puissant company despite the sudden drop in its stock price Enrons PE ratio of is still quite strong when compared against othe r energy companies In addition Enron is a company full of surprises and it is doubtful that any temporary drop in its stock price will keep the compan y down for long An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

IssueAlert for March New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies Plans for New Power Plant by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Sithe Energies Inc announced that in respon se to issues raised by local residents the company is reassessing its plans f or a power generating facility in Ramapo New York The alternative currently under review is a smaller peaking facility which would use no water for generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure reliability of the regions electricity supply Originally slated as an MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga s the alternative plant is a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas Analysis Sithe Energies original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav e been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant Ramapo is located miles north of New York City Chief amon g the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes In response to the concerns of residents Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output Unfortunately Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t he very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has some rather serious power supply concerns For background it is important to note that Exelon Corp owns nearly half of Sithe Energies In December Exelon acquired percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi percent Marubeni Corp percent and Sithe Management percent The acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon Jim McGowan Sithe senior vice president for development referenced the ro le that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki ng unit in the area Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed McGowan said Weve listened carefully to residents concern s and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean less visible and uses no water for generation McGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil e fulfilling the regions growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand As an independent power producer Sithe Energies owns power plants across t he United States and internationally The company has a generation presence in such states as California Colorado Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania among several others In New York Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately M W Batavia MW Independence Station Scriba NY MW Massena MW Ogdensburg MW and Sterling Sherill NY MW In addition t o the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station an MW power plant located near Lake Ontario A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete However projects under MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement which generally involves a detailedand time consumingexamination of alternatives The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further Ne w York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum heightened by the ongoing problems in California Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies Ramapo plant which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t o generate power While other new plants are being planned in New York realistically it will be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit y to ease concerns about shortages Meanwhile the state enters this summers season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands Ne w York City like other areas of the Northeast the Midwest and California i s in a very serious situation reported a member of the New York Public Service Commission to the New Assembly While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November FERC report entitled Investigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlights specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study says Li ke northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti es of power on constrained transmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densel y populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes i s generated by the city New plants are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be MW short of its required MW generating capacit y needs this summer That projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added This years demand is expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts According to the FERC report New York City s load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incit y capacity along with imports to meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall Long Island has a potential MW shortfall to meet the required MW of power The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with in the next few months the state could suffer some of Californias problems However despite the need for additional power generation in the state the intense public scrutiny of Sithes plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants throughout the state For instance the New York Power Authoritys NYPA plan to install ten MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi on from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group NYIRG which has sued the NYPA charging that it circumvented the environmental review process for siting new plants In addition FERCs report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were approximately projects proposed to be built in New York State as of November The report indicated that only one of these projects is likely to be built in the next three to four years Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit McGowan has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy requirements If it does it will make the same mistakes for which Californ ia is now paying a tremendous price Along the same lines William Muesler CE O of the New York ISO recently said that to avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown New York must move quickly to build more powe r plants Muesler cited that MW of new power plant capacity percent more than is currently available must be constructed in New York by o r shortages will become likely pushing up prices and increasing the odds of rolling blackouts However despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants not in my back yard has been a common response in New York Even New Jerseys acting Governor Donald T DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos e opposing new power plants in the region DiFrancesco reportedly told a meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th at he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec ts in New York and New Jersey Included in the task force are members of DiFrancescos own staff the state Department of Environmental Protection a nd the Attorney Generals Office Moreover although California offers a clear picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate supply New York appears to be heading down a similar path Although California and New York have different restructuring models one market factor is the same in both states supply that cannot meet demand We know the toll that this inequity has had on California Is it only a matter of time before New York suffers the same consequences An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March Dissension at FERC Commission Divided On Price Caps Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters March The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout s and price spikes The three FERC commissioners who regulate interstate electricity markets testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts Analysis Since the start of deregulation in the early s FERCs variou s positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent Despite its changing members as a whole the fivemember commission with two positions currently open has taken a handsoff approach to its regulatory role preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry In fact Curt Hbert appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe n FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether However significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker A s the federal regulatory body for the energy industry FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country Th e debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu re leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt At the House of Representatives meeting on March Hbert a Republican reiterated his objections to price caps Chairman Hbert has maintained his longstanding opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do longterm damage In January Hbert told me I have seen no evidence th at price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level Hbert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other shortterm resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California Reuters reported that Hbert said at the hearings that such controls are n ot a longterm solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West Rather Hbert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants both in California and elsewhere Hbert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand thus correcting the current imbalance Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect Despite Hberts opposition to wholesale price caps fellow Commissioner William Massey a Democrat asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary time out or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju st and reasonable rates Massey said In addition Massey reportedly also sai d that such a price cap could be calculated on a generatorbygenerator basi s at each generators variable operating cost plus a reasonable capacity adder perhaps in the range of per megawatt hour Massey reiterated th e severity of the crisis in California noting that whereas wholesale power i n the state cost billion in it increased to billion in and could exceed billion for Rounding out the commissions divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt a Democrat who said that all possible options should be analyze d and debated Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric e controls Chairman Hberts stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investmen t in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power produce rs to other regions of the country and further away from California The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps Abraham said Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin g is scheduled for later this week Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton a Texas Republican noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o r not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE RC over major issues facing the energy industry The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs FERCs December vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated ThenCommissioner Hbert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT O met FERC guidelines for RTO formation and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO However Hbert stood as a minority The other three commissioners at FERC at the time Hoecker Massey and Breathitt preferred to wield a tight er regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy While Hbert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti es and letting free market principles rule the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities Meanwhile speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to the position of FERC chairman Hbert was named chairman in February by Preside nt Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan At that time the president did not indicate that Hberts appointment as chair was temporary Wood was appoint ed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in and played a primary role i n the development of that states restructuring plan Electric choice begins in Texas on June with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate d There are two Republican openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush As noted presently Hbert is the only Republican among the current three members Wood reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time However the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman forcing Hbert to step back into a role as commissioner The report in Reuters indicated that Hbert a friend and protg of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss is personally fighting the planned move The nomination would require Senate confirmation Moreover as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC th e issue of price caps remains unresolved The debate over price caps also has divided others involved strictly along party lines Generally speaking Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha t has been called price gouging on the part of energy companies Republica ns believe that the government including FERC and the Bush administration should maintain a handsoff approach and allow the marketplace to determi ne prices Speaking from a nonpartisan point of view some economists now question whetherand not just howderegulation of electricity markets should occur at all For instance Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economis t who helped deregulate other industries says that electricity markets may n ot lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities allowing a single regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity The movemen t toward reregulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps Yet in any event once again California remains the catalyst for decisionmaking on this issue As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in to a third day in the state federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country As the industrys top agency in charge of wholesale markets FERCs ultimate position on price ca ps carries tremendous influence Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b e conducted or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Citing an emergency shortage of electricity across the state California power officials ordered rolling blackouts on Monday March in a move to avoid toppling the power grid The California Independent System Operator ISO which manages about percent of the transmission grid serving the states million residents ordered the blackouts shortly before noon Pacific time and said they would likely last through pm Pacific time on March It was the first time rolling blackouts have hit the southern hal f of the state and the third time this year in the north following two days of outages on Jan and Analysis Despite all the recent efforts taken by Calif Gray Davis to solv e the states severe energy problems it now seems inevitable that California is headed toward another volatile summer full of power problems One of the states fundamental problemssupply that cannot keep up with demandi s being addressed by the governor and the Bush administration and is projected to be solved within the next two or three years However the new power supply that is being planned to serve the state is not coming online quickly enoug h to stave off problems for this summer In addition the current rolling blackouts facing the state are worse than previously enforced cutbacks and have impacted almost all parts of the state as opposed to more confined areas The most recent problem appears to have resulted from unusually warm weathe r in the southern part of the state that drove up use of airconditioned powe r This left the state as a whole with limited reserves at a time when power plant maintenance and a lack of hydropower already was causing problems in Northern California Reportedly about MW of power were lost due to a transformer fire at a Southern California plant and other idled plants acro ss the state In addition about to MW of production from qualifyi ng facilities QFs was unavailable on the day of the rolling blackouts The Q Fs that were offline typically have produced only small amounts of power under contract to the states three major utilities However the QFs have stoppe d producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison and the fact that they ha ve been paid only a small percentage of what they are owed for power previousl y produced Under normal circumstances the QFs can generate as much as percent of the states electricity needs As a result the California ISO issued a Stage emergency alert the highe st level of emergency indicating that power reserves had fallen below percent In addition Pacific Gas Electric Co implemented blackouts acro ss Northern California including San Francisco and the Silicon Valley Southe rn California Edison turned off the lights in neighborhoods around Los Angeles Together the two utilities serve about million Californians and operat ed the rolling blackouts by moving through a series of predetermined blocks of customers Operators at substations were directed to turn off power for a block of customers for about to minutes then restore service and mov e on to a subsequent block of customers Public safety outlets such as police and fire stations were not included in the rolling blackouts although othe r public services such as traffic lights were affected by the outages While the rolling blackouts occurred Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham spok e at the US Chamber of Commerce and acknowledged that California clearly wi ll not have enough power supply to meet demand this summer Abraham said that the state will need about MW to meet summer demand while only MW of generation is expected to be available Abraham also reiterated that the Bush administration will present a very comprehensive and balanced energy plan in the coming weeks one that most likely will focus on increasing domestic supply and reducing US dependence on foreign sources for oil as well as conservation efforts Theres really only three thing s you can do about a difference between supply and demand Abraham said On e is to conserve more The second is to import more And the third is to produce more I think we want to focus more on conserving more and producin g more rather than depending more on other countries However only days earlier the Bush administration warned that electricity blackouts in California appear inevitable this summer but continued to issue a strong statement of opposition to addressing the problem with wholesale price caps In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investment in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power producers to other regions of the country and further away from California The Bush administrations position on price caps is in contrast with what appears to be a change in policy from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which historically has also opposed any regional price caps A report that originated in the Wall Stree t Journal last week indicated that FERC is leaning toward setting tighter limits on the price that generators can charge for power in California particularly on hot summer days when shortages could be acute Reportedly a new rule from FERC on wholesale price caps would set maximum prices during electrical emergencies based on each plants actual operating costs Yet Abraham remains firm that price caps will do nothing to abate the blackouts for which Californians appear to be headed this summer At a Sena te hearing on price control legislation last week Abraham said Let me be clear on this Any action we take must either help increase supply or reduc e demand Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand In fact they will aggravate the supply crisis Thus we return to the fundamental problem that will continue to cause problems in California and other areas the need for new power supply and time limitations associated with establishing that supply In my IssueAlert for March I addressed the discrepancy regarding Californias power needs versus power supply The conclusions I made at that time now appear to be further validated During the month of Augusttypically the hottest mont h in Californiapeak daily demand for power in the California ISO territory i s expected to hit about MW The states three IOUsPGE SCE and Sa n Diego Gas Electricstill generate about MW from their remaining power plants and have longterm contracts from wind solar and other energy sourc es that gain them an additional MW of power Gov Davis has established that about MW from the longterm contracts will be available this summer In addition back in February Davis announced a plan to expedite t he approval and siting process for new power plants in the state which he promised would bring MW online by July an ambitious goal that may or may not materialize Altogether assuming that all of these projections are reliable the total comes to about MW that we know should be available in California thi s summer leaving the state about MW short for its power supply needs As noted Abraham has suggested a California supply demand imbalance of MW of demand versus MW of supply which would make for a slightly less severe scenario However Abraham has not fully detailed the data on which he has based his projections Nevertheless no matter how the actual numbers shake out most everyone agrees that the summer prognosis is not good for California Rather than questioning if additional blackouts will occur the ongoing debate relates to how severe the anticipated outages will become and how long they will last before additional power supply can be established in the state And althou gh today marks the first day of spring and summer is officially still weeks away Californias problems have already started in full force According t o statements from the California ISO some of the power supply that had been offline due to mechanical problems during the day on March could be back online by March However that will account for only about to MW which is not nearly enough to offset additional problems for California thi s week assuming that temperatures in the state remain warm Yet as one energy executive once commented California continues to apply BandAids on hemorrhaging wounds While the state continues to send out its SOS signal what is needed is a reliable longterm solution that will provide a substantial amount of power to Californians There is little chan ce of this solution being found before this summer so as the temperature continues to rise on the West Coast California energy officials will be challenged to contain the damage of the states ongoing energy crisis An archive list of previous

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Citing an emergency shortage of electricity across the state California power officials ordered rolling blackouts on Monday March in a move to avoid toppling the power grid The California Independent System Operator ISO which manages about percent of the transmission grid serving the states million residents ordered the blackouts shortly before noon Pacific time and said they would likely last through pm Pacific time on March It was the first time rolling blackouts have hit the southern hal f of the state and the third time this year in the north following two days of outages on Jan and Analysis Despite all the recent efforts taken by Calif Gray Davis to solv e the states severe energy problems it now seems inevitable that California is headed toward another volatile summer full of power problems One of the states fundamental problemssupply that cannot keep up with demandi s being addressed by the governor and the Bush administration and is projected to be solved within the next two or three years However the new power supply that is being planned to serve the state is not coming online quickly enoug h to stave off problems for this summer In addition the current rolling blackouts facing the state are worse than previously enforced cutbacks and have impacted almost all parts of the state as opposed to more confined areas The most recent problem appears to have resulted from unusually warm weathe r in the southern part of the state that drove up use of airconditioned powe r This left the state as a whole with limited reserves at a time when power plant maintenance and a lack of hydropower already was causing problems in Northern California Reportedly about MW of power were lost due to a transformer fire at a Southern California plant and other idled plants acro ss the state In addition about to MW of production from qualifyi ng facilities QFs was unavailable on the day of the rolling blackouts The Q Fs that were offline typically have produced only small amounts of power under contract to the states three major utilities However the QFs have stoppe d producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison and the fact that they ha ve been paid only a small percentage of what they are owed for power previousl y produced Under normal circumstances the QFs can generate as much as percent of the states electricity needs As a result the California ISO issued a Stage emergency alert the highe st level of emergency indicating that power reserves had fallen below percent In addition Pacific Gas Electric Co implemented blackouts acro ss Northern California including San Francisco and the Silicon Valley Southe rn California Edison turned off the lights in neighborhoods around Los Angeles Together the two utilities serve about million Californians and operat ed the rolling blackouts by moving through a series of predetermined blocks of customers Operators at substations were directed to turn off power for a block of customers for about to minutes then restore service and mov e on to a subsequent block of customers Public safety outlets such as police and fire stations were not included in the rolling blackouts although othe r public services such as traffic lights were affected by the outages While the rolling blackouts occurred Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham spok e at the US Chamber of Commerce and acknowledged that California clearly wi ll not have enough power supply to meet demand this summer Abraham said that the state will need about MW to meet summer demand while only MW of generation is expected to be available Abraham also reiterated that the Bush administration will present a very comprehensive and balanced energy plan in the coming weeks one that most likely will focus on increasing domestic supply and reducing US dependence on foreign sources for oil as well as conservation efforts Theres really only three thing s you can do about a difference between supply and demand Abraham said On e is to conserve more The second is to import more And the third is to produce more I think we want to focus more on conserving more and producin g more rather than depending more on other countries However only days earlier the Bush administration warned that electricity blackouts in California appear inevitable this summer but continued to issue a strong statement of opposition to addressing the problem with wholesale price caps In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investment in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power producers to other regions of the country and further away from California The Bush administrations position on price caps is in contrast with what appears to be a change in policy from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which historically has also opposed any regional price caps A report that originated in the Wall Stree t Journal last week indicated that FERC is leaning toward setting tighter limits on the price that generators can charge for power in California particularly on hot summer days when shortages could be acute Reportedly a new rule from FERC on wholesale price caps would set maximum prices during electrical emergencies based on each plants actual operating costs Yet Abraham remains firm that price caps will do nothing to abate the blackouts for which Californians appear to be headed this summer At a Sena te hearing on price control legislation last week Abraham said Let me be clear on this Any action we take must either help increase supply or reduc e demand Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand In fact they will aggravate the supply crisis Thus we return to the fundamental problem that will continue to cause problems in California and other areas the need for new power supply and time limitations associated with establishing that supply In my IssueAlert for March I addressed the discrepancy regarding Californias power needs versus power supply The conclusions I made at that time now appear to be further validated During the month of Augusttypically the hottest mont h in Californiapeak daily demand for power in the California ISO territory i s expected to hit about MW The states three IOUsPGE SCE and Sa n Diego Gas Electricstill generate about MW from their remaining power plants and have longterm contracts from wind solar and other energy sourc es that gain them an additional MW of power Gov Davis has established that about MW from the longterm contracts will be available this summer In addition back in February Davis announced a plan to expedite t he approval and siting process for new power plants in the state which he promised would bring MW online by July an ambitious goal that may or may not materialize Altogether assuming that all of these projections are reliable the total comes to about MW that we know should be available in California thi s summer leaving the state about MW short for its power supply needs As noted Abraham has suggested a California supply demand imbalance of MW of demand versus MW of supply which would make for a slightly less severe scenario However Abraham has not fully detailed the data on which he has based his projections Nevertheless no matter how the actual numbers shake out most everyone agrees that the summer prognosis is not good for California Rather than questioning if additional blackouts will occur the ongoing debate relates to how severe the anticipated outages will become and how long they will last before additional power supply can be established in the state And althou gh today marks the first day of spring and summer is officially still weeks away Californias problems have already started in full force According t o statements from the California ISO some of the power supply that had been offline due to mechanical problems during the day on March could be back online by March However that will account for only about to MW which is not nearly enough to offset additional problems for California thi s week assuming that temperatures in the state remain warm Yet as one energy executive once commented California continues to apply BandAids on hemorrhaging wounds While the state continues to send out its SOS signal what is needed is a reliable longterm solution that will provide a substantial amount of power to Californians There is little chan ce of this solution being found before this summer so as the temperature continues to rise on the West Coast California energy officials will be challenged to contain the damage of the states ongoing energy crisis An archive list of previous

IssueAlert for March Dissension at FERC Commission Divided On Price Caps Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters March The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout s and price spikes The three FERC commissioners who regulate interstate electricity markets testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts Analysis Since the start of deregulation in the early s FERCs variou s positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent Despite its changing members as a whole the fivemember commission with two positions currently open has taken a handsoff approach to its regulatory role preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry In fact Curt Hbert appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe n FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether However significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker A s the federal regulatory body for the energy industry FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country Th e debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu re leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt At the House of Representatives meeting on March Hbert a Republican reiterated his objections to price caps Chairman Hbert has maintained his longstanding opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do longterm damage In January Hbert told me I have seen no evidence th at price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level Hbert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other shortterm resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California Reuters reported that Hbert said at the hearings that such controls are n ot a longterm solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West Rather Hbert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants both in California and elsewhere Hbert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand thus correcting the current imbalance Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect Despite Hberts opposition to wholesale price caps fellow Commissioner William Massey a Democrat asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary time out or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju st and reasonable rates Massey said In addition Massey reportedly also sai d that such a price cap could be calculated on a generatorbygenerator basi s at each generators variable operating cost plus a reasonable capacity adder perhaps in the range of per megawatt hour Massey reiterated th e severity of the crisis in California noting that whereas wholesale power i n the state cost billion in it increased to billion in and could exceed billion for Rounding out the commissions divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt a Democrat who said that all possible options should be analyze d and debated Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric e controls Chairman Hberts stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investmen t in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power produce rs to other regions of the country and further away from California The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps Abraham said Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin g is scheduled for later this week Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton a Texas Republican noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o r not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE RC over major issues facing the energy industry The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs FERCs December vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated ThenCommissioner Hbert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT O met FERC guidelines for RTO formation and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO However Hbert stood as a minority The other three commissioners at FERC at the time Hoecker Massey and Breathitt preferred to wield a tight er regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy While Hbert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti es and letting free market principles rule the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities Meanwhile speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to the position of FERC chairman Hbert was named chairman in February by Preside nt Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan At that time the president did not indicate that Hberts appointment as chair was temporary Wood was appoint ed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in and played a primary role i n the development of that states restructuring plan Electric choice begins in Texas on June with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate d There are two Republican openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush As noted presently Hbert is the only Republican among the current three members Wood reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time However the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman forcing Hbert to step back into a role as commissioner The report in Reuters indicated that Hbert a friend and protg of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss is personally fighting the planned move The nomination would require Senate confirmation Moreover as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC th e issue of price caps remains unresolved The debate over price caps also has divided others involved strictly along party lines Generally speaking Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha t has been called price gouging on the part of energy companies Republica ns believe that the government including FERC and the Bush administration should maintain a handsoff approach and allow the marketplace to determi ne prices Speaking from a nonpartisan point of view some economists now question whetherand not just howderegulation of electricity markets should occur at all For instance Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economis t who helped deregulate other industries says that electricity markets may n ot lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities allowing a single regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity The movemen t toward reregulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps Yet in any event once again California remains the catalyst for decisionmaking on this issue As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in to a third day in the state federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country As the industrys top agency in charge of wholesale markets FERCs ultimate position on price ca ps carries tremendous influence Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b e conducted or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this area An archive

IssueAlert for March New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies Plans for New Power Plant by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Sithe Energies Inc announced that in respon se to issues raised by local residents the company is reassessing its plans f or a power generating facility in Ramapo New York The alternative currently under review is a smaller peaking facility which would use no water for generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure reliability of the regions electricity supply Originally slated as an MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga s the alternative plant is a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas Analysis Sithe Energies original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav e been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant Ramapo is located miles north of New York City Chief amon g the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes In response to the concerns of residents Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output Unfortunately Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t he very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has some rather serious power supply concerns For background it is important to note that Exelon Corp owns nearly half of Sithe Energies In December Exelon acquired percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi percent Marubeni Corp percent and Sithe Management percent The acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon Jim McGowan Sithe senior vice president for development referenced the ro le that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki ng unit in the area Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed McGowan said Weve listened carefully to residents concern s and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean less visible and uses no water for generation McGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil e fulfilling the regions growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand As an independent power producer Sithe Energies owns power plants across t he United States and internationally The company has a generation presence in such states as California Colorado Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania among several others In New York Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately M W Batavia MW Independence Station Scriba NY MW Massena MW Ogdensburg MW and Sterling Sherill NY MW In addition t o the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station an MW power plant located near Lake Ontario A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete However projects under MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement which generally involves a detailedand time consumingexamination of alternatives The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further Ne w York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum heightened by the ongoing problems in California Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies Ramapo plant which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t o generate power While other new plants are being planned in New York realistically it will be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit y to ease concerns about shortages Meanwhile the state enters this summers season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands Ne w York City like other areas of the Northeast the Midwest and California i s in a very serious situation reported a member of the New York Public Service Commission to the New Assembly While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November FERC report entitled Investigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlights specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study says Li ke northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti es of power on constrained transmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densel y populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes i s generated by the city New plants are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be MW short of its required MW generating capacit y needs this summer That projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added This years demand is expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts According to the FERC report New York City s load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incit y capacity along with imports to meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall Long Island has a potential MW shortfall to meet the required MW of power The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with in the next few months the state could suffer some of Californias problems However despite the need for additional power generation in the state the intense public scrutiny of Sithes plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants throughout the state For instance the New York Power Authoritys NYPA plan to install ten MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi on from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group NYIRG which has sued the NYPA charging that it circumvented the environmental review process for siting new plants In addition FERCs report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were approximately projects proposed to be built in New York State as of November The report indicated that only one of these projects is likely to be built in the next three to four years Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit McGowan has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy requirements If it does it will make the same mistakes for which Californ ia is now paying a tremendous price Along the same lines William Muesler CE O of the New York ISO recently said that to avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown New York must move quickly to build more powe r plants Muesler cited that MW of new power plant capacity percent more than is currently available must be constructed in New York by o r shortages will become likely pushing up prices and increasing the odds of rolling blackouts However despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants not in my back yard has been a common response in New York Even New Jerseys acting Governor Donald T DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos e opposing new power plants in the region DiFrancesco reportedly told a meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th at he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec ts in New York and New Jersey Included in the task force are members of DiFrancescos own staff the state Department of Environmental Protection a nd the Attorney Generals Office Moreover although California offers a clear picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate supply New York appears to be heading down a similar path Although California and New York have different restructuring models one market factor is the same in both states supply that cannot meet demand We know the toll that this inequity has had on California Is it only a matter of time before New York suffers the same consequences An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

of electricity and naturalgas marketing giant Enron Corp NYSE ENE slid further on Thursday March amid broader weakness in energy stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year Enro n was off or percent at on March after falling percent on March So far this year Enrons stock is down about percent vers us a percent decline for Standard Poors utilities index and a percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average Analysis Over the last several weeks a growing number of smaller emergin g energy companies have felt the impact from the nations struggling economy and the likelihood of an impending recession Just recently startup companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have withdrawn their IPO plans citing an anemic stock market and the lack of positive cash flow A look across the stock market can send shivers down th e spines of most energy company CEOs as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below the point for the first time in two years and the Nasd aq composite remains percent off of its March high of putting the economy in bear market territory However while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies may crash and burn the giant energy company that is Enron Corp typically has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the US economy Over the course of Enron shares returned percent and traded at roughly times trailing earnings reportedly more than times the multiple of its some of its main competitors or the S Nevertheless Enrons winning streak in the stock market may be eroding as the waves that are crashing around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same whirlpool For perspective Enrons closest competitors across its various business lines Williams and Dynegy also appear to be taking the hit from the bear market Williams NYSE WMB saw its stock decline or percent to on March Dynegy NYSE DYN saw its stock drop or percent to Of course of the three companies Enron wields the highest PE ratio at and largest market capitalization at billion By comparison Williams has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion while Dynegy has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion Analysts that keep a close eye on Enrons stock say the sudden decline is n ot a reflection of any new business developments at the company but rather a market that is struggling in general and a growing disenchantment among investors in technology and telecommunications in particular This may be having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron g stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the telecommunications broadband market Just as the company has achieved unparalleled success in electricity and naturalgas trading for the last year Enron has been developing a highspeed broadband communications networ k to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing Enron projects a billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi ng and services by and the valuation of its own broadband business at a share or billion The company plans to trade excess bandwidth capacity and in order to do so is constructing its own network which cost s a lot of money Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between billion and billion in assets over the next months in order to reduce debt and support the new business in broadband among other businesses in pulp and paper data storage and advertising Thus much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business and Enrons role in it Up to this point confidence in both the industry a nd the company have run high Some analysts have reported that interest in Enrons expansion into this area validated by investor interest in new technologies in general drove an percent rise in the companys share price last year Yet once again the tide may be turning Investors no longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not resulted in bottomline profits much as the year before ecommerce stocks also found that their day in the sun ended rather abruptly And although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold its broadband business has remained immature In fact for yearend Enron Broadband Services reported a million IBIT loss reflecting start up costs to build the new business The company seems to have anticipated the slow growth of its broadband business In fact Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a nd six years for the companys naturalgas business to develop standardized contracts and increase liquidity Skilling has said that these numbers do n ot dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe r for the company While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t he broadband business investors may not be as patient Note that while Enron s broadband business took a loss for the company as a whole reported a percent increase in earnings per diluted share to and a percent increase in net income to billion In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for to between and per share In response to the sudden drop in stock price an d speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom e profitable Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it remains ver y comfortable with the earnings estimate An Enron spokesperson also ma de references to information in the market that is inaccurate suggesting th at any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded including potential layoffs at the broadband unit According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom investors polled by First Call Thompson Financial ar e still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of to for Nevertheless despite Enrons reassurances that it remains on track to meet its earnings estimate the companys stock continued to drop As noted investors began to put downward pressure on the stock pushing it to as of March below its week low of and far below its week hi gh of Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai n unclear about what it is that Enron does exactly According to a March article in Fortune magazine entitled Is Enron Overpriced some Wall Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money and the lack of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enrons pricey stock The skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enrons thunder in a bull market b ut that could all change quickly in a bear market Enron may in fact exacerbat e Wall Streets distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its financial records for what it deems competitive reasons The Fortune report which was published before Enrons stock began to decline also indicated that investors are concerned about Enrons debt Although the company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load Enron carried a net billion debt at the end of September Again although investor s may have been able to look the other way from Enrons debt during a strong economy it appears that investors will use a finetooth comb to examine th e companys financial records during the increasingly unstable economy Moreover in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog y and telecommunications stocks investors may also be concerned that a globa l economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole resulting in lower commodity prices Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly validate this theory Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of problems with its broadband unit Looking at the big picture it appears reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i n Enrons stock Rather Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o f several factors Yes investors appear to now be less likely to support new technologies and telecommunications businesses that have not proven to be presently profitable In addition Enron is in many ways an enigma In an unstable economy the uncertainty surrounding Enrons business could prompt an unprecedented hesitation about the companys business model And lastly Enron is not alone among energy stocks and stocks in general that are weathering the fallout of the stock market On the bright side Enron still remains a very puissant company despite the sudden drop in its stock price Enrons PE ratio of is still quite strong when compared against othe r energy companies In addition Enron is a company full of surprises and it is doubtful that any temporary drop in its stock price will keep the compan y down for long An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

take a stake in Britains fourth largest power utility Powergen NYSE PWG at a price percent above current levels According to the German paper Handelsblatt EONs supervisory board reportedly will make a final decisio n in the next week Powergen meanwhile said it is still in talks on a possible offer from another company There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer being made for the company Powergen said in a statement The company first announced that it was in talks to be purchased on Jan Analysis The word that EON Europes second largest power company would buy a stake in Powergen at a fat percent premium of around pounds increased Powergens British stock price by as much as percent to reach pence A combination of the two companies would create a power firm on par with Europes largest power companies Frances EDF and Italys Enel Since talks about a potential acquisition by EON surfaced in January Powergens stock price has climbed percent In addition according to Reuters Powergen jumped to the top of the gainers list for the United Kingdoms FTS E blue chip index On March Powergen stock reached pence while t he FTSE index was down percent at month lows Powergen also trades in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange where Powergen shares opened March at If the rumors about Powergens price tag are true EON would end up paying more than nine pounds a share or six billion pounds US billion for the UKbased Powergen which carries a debt of about billion pounds These projections exceed previous reports from financial analysts who suggested that EON would pay no more than eight pounds a share for Powerge n EON might be feeling increased pressure to finalize a deal with Powergen since other players such as Scottish Power have also expressed interest in the company With significant capital to spend Reuters reported up to billion including proposed divestitures EON reportedly believes that Britain where demand is outpacing the rest of Europe is the best country in which to begin a rapid expansion strategy Despite the fact that Powergen h ad previously acknowledged that it was working on a deal with EON over the last week it has maintained that discussions continue with other companies EON formed as a result of last years merger between Veba and Viag supplies Germany and Europe with electricity heating natural gas water a nd petroleum Germany which opened percent of its energy market all at on ce in April has undergone a period of rapid consolidation As a result the largest power companies in the country have begun seeking competitive opportunities across the Continent this is a growing trend in Europe as companies from other countries are following the same competitive strategy EON must expand outside of its home country where analysts have speculate d that core profits in its generation business have become unstable In many ways consolidation is a means of survival for EON as Europe continues to liberalize and electricity prices fall as a result Powergenwhich generates about percent of the electricity used in Eng land and Wales and has electric and gas operations throughout Europe India Asi a and Australiais a company that became known for its global expansion efforts especially in the United States Just last December Powergen completed a billion acquisition of Louisville Kybased LGOEnergy Cor p Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market as a result of consolidation that had taken place in the United Kingdom The acquisitio n of LGObecame appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which was thought to support any further expansion that Powergen might have had in mind Powergen has a market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of according to Yahoo Finance However the company has struggled over the last year Powergens primary subsidiary LGOEnergy saw its profit for decline by percent to million from million As the parent company Powergen saw its profits decline by percent in to million from million although its revenue increased percent to billion up from billion in Keep in mind that Powergens acquisition of LGOwas not completed until December so LGEs earnings will be reflected fully in its parents financial report starting this year If EON were to acquire Powergen it would gain several strategic advantage s EON would no longer be reliant solely on the German market where falling prices and continued consolidation limit competitive opportunities In addition the purchase would give EON a hold on generating assets in the United Kingdom and the comparatively lowcost power production millio n customers and various business operations that LGOoffers in the United States As noted Powergen has acknowledged that it has received approaches from E ON and other companies Based on available reports those other companies ar e most likely RWE Germanys largest power supplier and a rival of EON Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise French megautilities and an unnamed American power company Enron or Southern Energy would be my best guess However word from its management team is that Powergen is not interested in getting tied up as a purchased entity in merger or acquisition proceedings at thi s time as it may be planning additional purchases of its own in the United States On the other hand the rationale for Powergen to be sold to a company like EON is taking shape British restructuring law has forced large generators to sell power stations to reduce any likelihood of market power As a resul t Powergen has morphed from a pure UK generating company to a broadbased company engaged in telecommunications gas and distribution services Ed Wallis Powergens CEO has stated that presently it has become very difficult for Powergen to compete with larger rivals in an enlarged Europea n market As noted Powergens strategy over the last year has been one of further expansion in the United States and the purchase of LGOwas perhaps more expensive than Powergen had planned In order to make further US acquisitions Powergen needs adequate capital or equity in order to finance the acquisition something that has become more difficult since its purchas e of LGE Nevertheless if the deal takes place it will require regulatory approval i n the United States from FERC the SEC and the Kentucky Public Service Commission among other possible agencies The climate for US energy industry mergers and acquisitions has become rather turbulent in recent weeks Three highprofile mergers Entergy FPL Group Con Edison Northeast Utilities and Sierra Pacific Resources Portland General have a ll encountered difficulties that could derail their pending deals In addition according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal announced worldwid e mergers and acquisitions this year totaled billion as of March which is about onethird of the volume during the same period last year Also about merger deals have been withdrawn from the market compared with deals that were withdrawn for the same period last year according to the WSJ report Analysts that have been closely watching the potential for an EON Powerg en deal say that Powergens US operations in LGOcould prove to be a major stumbling block for the two companies and that EON may find US regulato ry requirements to be much more stringent than those in Europe Specifically the SEC has strict rules regarding what kinds of companies can own public utilities a category into which LGOfalls and EONs diverse nonpower operations may send some red flags to American regulators Consequently although EON appears rather confident that this deal will be completed rather soon Powergens reported resistance and US regulatory obstacles m ay thwart this yettobeformallyannounced partnership An

the Past Two Weeks by Bob Bellemare Vice President Utility Services US Electric Power of Point Lookout New York announced plans to construc t a megawatt MW coal fired power plant at Cherry Point in Whatcom Count y Washington Just last week Reliant Energy Seward LLC a subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced it is planning on constructing a MW circulati ng fluidized bed CFB cleancoal power plant in Indiana County Pennsylvania Analysis As the United States awakes from its energy policy slumber it i s becoming increasingly apparent that the days of near complete reliance on naturalgasfired generation to meet our growing energy needs is coming to an end According to EIA statistics natural gas prices have risen to histori c highs with January utility deliveries exceeding MMBtu compared to and prices which floated between and MMBtu Virtually overnight natural gas has gone from one of the least expensive generation fuels to one of the most expensive Since the January price spike prices have settled back down to the to MMBtu level for Henry Hub futures prices but even these prices would have been considered high just twelve months ago Coal by comparison is the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves Coal price s have actually dropped for utility deliveries over the past several years according to EIA statistics In coal prices averaged shortto n MMbtu compared to shortton MMbtu for second quarter Although coal generation currently represents over percent of US generation production few plants have recently been built because of the environmental concerns associated with coal generation and the relatively l ow price for natural gas throughout the s In US coal production actually declined by percent which was primarily attributable to a larg e drop in coal exports coupled by smaller than usual growth in coal consumpti on for power generation But brighter days may lie ahead for the coal industry New socalled cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed In the s and s the pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor PFBC was developed removing sulfur SO pollutants and limiting the formation of nitrogen oxi de NOx pollutants inside the boiler The need for scrubbers or other postcombustion controls was eliminated by technology Texas New Mexico Power TNP constructed two MW lignitefired units that went operationa l in and based on the circulating fluidized bed CFB technology th at Reliant is proposing for its MW facility in Pennsylvania The TNP One power plant was however extremely costly to build Unit cost million kW and Unit cost million kW to construct Another technology being developed is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More than percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada In the early s PSI Energy and Destec teamed up to construct a MW IGCC generatin g unit at the Wabash River Project in Indiana for a total installation cost o f million kW In TECO completed the construction of its MW IGCC generating unit at Polk Power station in Florida for a total installation cost of million kW Japan has also experimented with cleancoal technologies In Hokkaid o Electric Power Co Inc started commercial operation of a MW PFBC power plant Test operations are being carried out at two other plants the MW unit of Chugoku Electric Power Co and the MW unit of Kyushu Electric Power Co Japan is also testing a pilot scale MW molten carbonate fuel cell MCFC at a Chubu Electric Power Co site It is interesting to note that these advanced technologies have historicall y approached the installation cost of a nuclear plant but have all the operational costs of a coal plant Now market conditions have changed and despite the high capital and operating costs cleancoal technologies can economically compete with naturalgasfired generation if gas prices continue to remain high Additionally expectations are that the next generation of cleancoal power plants will cost significantly less than the early pioneers cost The Department of Energy DOE for example assumes an IGGC power plant can be built for kW with an average heat rate of BtukWh in its Annual Energy Outlook report The DOE deserves a great deal of credit for bringing cleancoal technology to the point of commercialization In the cleancoal experiment began i n response to the USCanadian transboundary problem of acid rain In March of President Reagan agreed to a new billion publicprivate initiative to make cleancoal technologies a reality The program led to projects in states including cofunding demonstration projects such as the PSIDestec and TECO facilities In the mids the only options for reducing NOx pollution cost per ton todays low NOx burners have reduced this cost to under ton These low NOx burners have also reduc ed emission levels from parts per million ppm in the early s to ppm today Furthermore the Selective Catalytic Reduction SCR process reduces more than of the NOx contained in coal combustion gas The DOE reports that percent of all coalfired capacity in this country is now outfitted with lowNOx burners Similarly the cost for scrubbing technology which removes sulfur pollutants has been reduced percent since the s The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most important technical issues for coal power plants because of its high carbon content The latest commercial plant has achieved a thermal efficiency of percent by increasing steam temperature and pressure Even with these improved efficiencies the coal power plant of the future may still be unab le to achieve the substantial greenhouse gas reductions that could be necessar y to address global climate change concerns There are other existing environmental regulations that may also limit the adoption of new coal generation The SIP Call rule requires Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce NOx emission by a specified amount by May with muc h of the reductions expected to come from coalfired power plants In the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment estimated at billion per year particulate and billion per year ozone respectively The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules and recently supported the EPAs right to regulate these emissions see IssueAlert at wwwConsultRCIcom These rules are significant since they will lead to additional NOx and SO emission reductions the two precursors to fine airborne particles Mercury reductions are also being contemplated In November the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for Clean Air Act violations In a settlement with TECO TECO agreed to cut NO x and SO emissions by percent by and pay a million civil penalty But in the end the nation will likely turn to coal to help meet its growin g energy demands Great strides have been made to reduce the environmental impact of this abundant fuel source Since the use of coal has more than doubled while emissions of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants have decline d by percent and percent respectively If we can continue to achieve even greater emission reductions coal may well help provide the energy bridge to the future An archive list

Industry Analysis The AES Corporation NYSE AES announced that it has completed its acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises the Indianapolis Indbased utility wit h MW of generation and customers in and around Indianapolis IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange of shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be exchanged for shares of AES common stock IPALCO common stock was suspended from trading at the close of the market on March Analysis The purchase of IPALCO an established and respected utility in t he Midwest will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an d further the companys aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid e of its business AES already owns CILCORP an energy services company whose largest subsidiary CILCO serves portions of Illinois and Missouri Note that pursuant to an SEC order AES will restructure andor sell its ownersh ip interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an exempt holding company under PUHCA Thus through the purchase of IPALCO AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has established In addition from this purchase we now know that AES along wi th being a global player intends to remain dominant throughout the United States as well Further the acquisition represents a rather bright development for AES considering that the company has recently encountered some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California First lets examine the value of AES acquisition of IPALCO Certainly th e MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow

Director Electric Industry Analysis California regulators earlier this week approved electricity rate increases topping percent the largest in the states history The California Publ ic Utilities Commission CPUC voted unanimously to raise rates by cents KWh The rate hikes which take effect immediately but wont appear on customer bills until May apply to millions of customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric the states two largest utilities Lowincome residents are exempt from the increases Analysis For context keep in mind that it was only two months ago that th e CPUC approved its first rate increase in response to the staggering debt of SCE and PGOand other factors related to the California energy crisis In early January the CPUC approved temporary rate hikes of percent for residential customers about a month for the average customer and to percent for businesses The temporary increases were only to remain in effe ct for days and will be expiring shortly At that time both PGOand SCE denounced the temporary increase which was not surprising considering that the to percent increase was much lower than the utilities had requeste d PGOasked for a percent increase and SCE had asked for percent The January rate increase was followed by an additional percent increase tha t is set to take effect next year The CPUCs current ruling increases rates by about percent at SCE and percent at PGE However the CPUCs measure will most likely serve to benefit the state more than SCE or PGE The CPUC clearly established that none of the additional revenue earned from the rate increases can be used b y the utilities to pay for past power purchase costs which have amounted to about billion In addition the CPUC adopted a proposal by consumer gro up Toward Utility Rate Normalization TURN that a rate cap preventing the utilities from charging market rates should be extended In other words th e portion of the electric rates that PGOand SCE actually receive from ratepayers will remain frozen for the foreseeable future The CPUC has established that the utilities must still recover billions of dollars in stranded costs before the rate freeze can be lifted Thus it appears that most of the revenue accumulated from the rate increas es will be used to reimburse the state of California for the power purchases i t continues to make on behalf of the utilities and will not be used to pay of f any existing debt held by the utilities PGOalready has responded that the CPUC ruling attempts to completely change the ratemaking rules that are us ed to determine the end of the rate freeze under AB PGOhas said that it will challenge this and other aspects of the CPUC ruling However even though most of the money from the rate increases will go to t he state it is also not presently clear if the increases will be sufficient t o reimburse California for the billion it has already spent to procure power or compensate for the anticipated billion that it will have to p ay for power this year Some of the funds generated by the rate increases must be used by PGOand SCE to pay for power that they still obtain from supplier s or to cover costs for their own power generation Consequently the CPUC ha s left open the possibility that additional rate increases may be necessary Although it is still being evaluated how individual customer classes will b e impacted by the rate increases it is fairly clear that large commercial an d industrial customers will end up paying the most Loretta Lynch president of the CPUC maintained that an underlying goal of the increase is to force what she referred to as electricity hogs or those people who excessively use power without concern for the states supply shortage to conserve Lyn ch has said that conservation is the key to staving off additional rate hikes and that the higher rates should put financial pressure on Californians to conserve energy which theoretically should help to reduce the risk of blackouts in the state this summer The average residential cost for a kilowatt hour is about cents for SCE customers and cents for PGOcustomers The new rate increase will add about cents KWh for the customers of both utilities which as noted averages out to about a percent increase at SCE and a percent increase at PGOfor electricity alone However Lynch also established that a tiered pricing structure which ha s yet to be fully determined will be put into place The tiered pricing syst em will reward customers who conserve energy and penalize those who do not Essentially this means that those customers who use the most power will ultimately pay the most and could face additional rate increases this year which the CPUC did not rule out as a possibility Under a tiered pricing structure those customers who conserve on their power usage may not see their bills increase beyond the rate increase approved this week The CPUC also ruled that PGOand SCE must pay small independent generators i n the state known as qualifying facilities for energy within days of delivery Over the last week California has again issued Stage emergencies signaling that power reserves have fallen to dangerously low levels Contributing to the problem is the fact that QFs have stopped producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of PGOand S CE and the fact that they have been paid only a small percentage of what they are owed for power previously produced Under normal circumstances the QFs can generate as much as percent of the states electricity needs The CP UC ruled that PGOand SCE must pay the QFs within days of the end of a billi ng period or suffer from penalties equal to the amount of their outstanding payment Gray Davis who throughout his tenure as Californias governor assured Californians that rates would not be increased attempted to distance himse lf from the CPUCs ruling and in fact issued a statement that he has no contr ol over the commissions decision Further Davis said that the rate increase was premature because the state is still evaluating the financial numbers that are needed to make a sound decision In turn the CPUCs Lynch criticized both the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC for failing to act on energy rates up to this point In addition to its comments regarding the rate freeze PGOresponded with a mixed reaction to the CPUCs ruling on the rate increase On one hand the utility said the ruling offered a welcome dose of realism However the utility also said that the rate increase does not offer a comprehensive solution fails to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even creat e more instability Based on previous statements that PGOhas made the utili ty believes that the states fundamental problem has its origins in the wholesale market where prices have often exceeded MWh Some power generators many of whom have been lambasted by California and federal regulators for alleged price gouging went on record with a favorab le response to the rate increases Jeffrey Skilling Enrons CEO said There s been a need to balance supply and demand in California and to date I don t think anyone has been willing to let the prices rise to help balance supply and demand So the increases are a huge step forward in reducing the odds of shortfalls Keith Bailey chairman and CEO of Williams told Reuters that he thought the CPUCs rate increase was a rational decision and something that the industry has been suggesting for some time Naturally many consumer activists reacted vehemently against the rate increases and protested during the CPUCs proceedings The main argument of the consumer groups is that the CPUC the governor and FERC have not fulfilled their regulatory responsibilities in bringing down electricity prices in the state and have not acted with enough force to restrict what they perceive as excessive prices for power owned by outofstate generator s This position gained momentum last week when the California ISO reported th at electricity wholesalers overcharged state utilities by billion over th e past months Consumer groups also continue to oppose any sort of a bailout for PGOand SCE and believe that the utilities have hidden money under the protection of other subsidiaries within their parent companies Both utilities maintain that any financial restructuring activities they ha ve implemented have been legal Moreover while the rate increases may help the state to continue securing power on behalf of the utilities other fundamental problems related to the states energy crisis remain unresolved The CPUC has asserted that part of the benefit of the rate increases is to keep the utilities financially solvent However at the same time the commission clearly states that none of the extra revenue generated by the rate hikes can be used to pay down th e utilities outstanding debt Consequently although the higher rates should significantly increase revenues for both utilities billion a year for SCE and billion a year for PGE all of this money apparently will be turned over to the state and do little to alleviate the utilities own financial problems This issue still remains unresolved and under the domai n of the state legislature However the likelihood that PGOand SCE would nee d to declare bankruptcy remains strong unless additional rate increases or securitization takes place In addition other fundamental problems such a s the supply demand imbalance in California and the related volatility of t he states wholesale market continue to wreak havoc on the markets stakeholders While the CPUCs rate increases may be a positive step toward stabilizing the states financial the future remains quite

generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow

the Past Two Weeks by Bob Bellemare Vice President Utility Services US Electric Power of Point Lookout New York announced plans to construc t a megawatt MW coal fired power plant at Cherry Point in Whatcom Count y Washington Just last week Reliant Energy Seward LLC a subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced it is planning on constructing a MW circulati ng fluidized bed CFB cleancoal power plant in Indiana County Pennsylvania Analysis As the United States awakes from its energy policy slumber it i s becoming increasingly apparent that the days of near complete reliance on naturalgasfired generation to meet our growing energy needs is coming to an end According to EIA statistics natural gas prices have risen to histori c highs with January utility deliveries exceeding MMBtu compared to and prices which floated between and MMBtu Virtually overnight natural gas has gone from one of the least expensive generation fuels to one of the most expensive Since the January price spike prices have settled back down to the to MMBtu level for Henry Hub futures prices but even these prices would have been considered high just twelve months ago Coal by comparison is the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves Coal price s have actually dropped for utility deliveries over the past several years according to EIA statistics In coal prices averaged shortto n MMbtu compared to shortton MMbtu for second quarter Although coal generation currently represents over percent of US generation production few plants have recently been built because of the environmental concerns associated with coal generation and the relatively l ow price for natural gas throughout the s In US coal production actually declined by percent which was primarily attributable to a larg e drop in coal exports coupled by smaller than usual growth in coal consumpti on for power generation But brighter days may lie ahead for the coal industry New socalled cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed In the s and s the pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor PFBC was developed removing sulfur SO pollutants and limiting the formation of nitrogen oxi de NOx pollutants inside the boiler The need for scrubbers or other postcombustion controls was eliminated by technology Texas New Mexico Power TNP constructed two MW lignitefired units that went operationa l in and based on the circulating fluidized bed CFB technology th at Reliant is proposing for its MW facility in Pennsylvania The TNP One power plant was however extremely costly to build Unit cost million kW and Unit cost million kW to construct Another technology being developed is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More than percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada In the early s PSI Energy and Destec teamed up to construct a MW IGCC generatin g unit at the Wabash River Project in Indiana for a total installation cost o f million kW In TECO completed the construction of its MW IGCC generating unit at Polk Power station in Florida for a total installation cost of million kW Japan has also experimented with cleancoal technologies In Hokkaid o Electric Power Co Inc started commercial operation of a MW PFBC power plant Test operations are being carried out at two other plants the MW unit of Chugoku Electric Power Co and the MW unit of Kyushu Electric Power Co Japan is also testing a pilot scale MW molten carbonate fuel cell MCFC at a Chubu Electric Power Co site It is interesting to note that these advanced technologies have historicall y approached the installation cost of a nuclear plant but have all the operational costs of a coal plant Now market conditions have changed and despite the high capital and operating costs cleancoal technologies can economically compete with naturalgasfired generation if gas prices continue to remain high Additionally expectations are that the next generation of cleancoal power plants will cost significantly less than the early pioneers cost The Department of Energy DOE for example assumes an IGGC power plant can be built for kW with an average heat rate of BtukWh in its Annual Energy Outlook report The DOE deserves a great deal of credit for bringing cleancoal technology to the point of commercialization In the cleancoal experiment began i n response to the USCanadian transboundary problem of acid rain In March of President Reagan agreed to a new billion publicprivate initiative to make cleancoal technologies a reality The program led to projects in states including cofunding demonstration projects such as the PSIDestec and TECO facilities In the mids the only options for reducing NOx pollution cost per ton todays low NOx burners have reduced this cost to under ton These low NOx burners have also reduc ed emission levels from parts per million ppm in the early s to ppm today Furthermore the Selective Catalytic Reduction SCR process reduces more than of the NOx contained in coal combustion gas The DOE reports that percent of all coalfired capacity in this country is now outfitted with lowNOx burners Similarly the cost for scrubbing technology which removes sulfur pollutants has been reduced percent since the s The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most important technical issues for coal power plants because of its high carbon content The latest commercial plant has achieved a thermal efficiency of percent by increasing steam temperature and pressure Even with these improved efficiencies the coal power plant of the future may still be unab le to achieve the substantial greenhouse gas reductions that could be necessar y to address global climate change concerns There are other existing environmental regulations that may also limit the adoption of new coal generation The SIP Call rule requires Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce NOx emission by a specified amount by May with muc h of the reductions expected to come from coalfired power plants In the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment estimated at billion per year particulate and billion per year ozone respectively The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules and recently supported the EPAs right to regulate these emissions see IssueAlert at wwwConsultRCIcom These rules are significant since they will lead to additional NOx and SO emission reductions the two precursors to fine airborne particles Mercury reductions are also being contemplated In November the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for Clean Air Act violations In a settlement with TECO TECO agreed to cut NO x and SO emissions by percent by and pay a million civil penalty But in the end the nation will likely turn to coal to help meet its growin g energy demands Great strides have been made to reduce the environmental impact of this abundant fuel source Since the use of coal has more than doubled while emissions of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants have decline d by percent and percent respectively If we can continue to achieve even greater emission reductions coal may well help provide the energy bridge to the future An archive list

take a stake in Britains fourth largest power utility Powergen NYSE PWG at a price percent above current levels According to the German paper Handelsblatt EONs supervisory board reportedly will make a final decisio n in the next week Powergen meanwhile said it is still in talks on a possible offer from another company There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer being made for the company Powergen said in a statement The company first announced that it was in talks to be purchased on Jan Analysis The word that EON Europes second largest power company would buy a stake in Powergen at a fat percent premium of around pounds increased Powergens British stock price by as much as percent to reach pence A combination of the two companies would create a power firm on par with Europes largest power companies Frances EDF and Italys Enel Since talks about a potential acquisition by EON surfaced in January Powergens stock price has climbed percent In addition according to Reuters Powergen jumped to the top of the gainers list for the United Kingdoms FTS E blue chip index On March Powergen stock reached pence while t he FTSE index was down percent at month lows Powergen also trades in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange where Powergen shares opened March at If the rumors about Powergens price tag are true EON would end up paying more than nine pounds a share or six billion pounds US billion for the UKbased Powergen which carries a debt of about billion pounds These projections exceed previous reports from financial analysts who suggested that EON would pay no more than eight pounds a share for Powerge n EON might be feeling increased pressure to finalize a deal with Powergen since other players such as Scottish Power have also expressed interest in the company With significant capital to spend Reuters reported up to billion including proposed divestitures EON reportedly believes that Britain where demand is outpacing the rest of Europe is the best country in which to begin a rapid expansion strategy Despite the fact that Powergen h ad previously acknowledged that it was working on a deal with EON over the last week it has maintained that discussions continue with other companies EON formed as a result of last years merger between Veba and Viag supplies Germany and Europe with electricity heating natural gas water a nd petroleum Germany which opened percent of its energy market all at on ce in April has undergone a period of rapid consolidation As a result the largest power companies in the country have begun seeking competitive opportunities across the Continent this is a growing trend in Europe as companies from other countries are following the same competitive strategy EON must expand outside of its home country where analysts have speculate d that core profits in its generation business have become unstable In many ways consolidation is a means of survival for EON as Europe continues to liberalize and electricity prices fall as a result Powergenwhich generates about percent of the electricity used in Eng land and Wales and has electric and gas operations throughout Europe India Asi a and Australiais a company that became known for its global expansion efforts especially in the United States Just last December Powergen completed a billion acquisition of Louisville Kybased LGOEnergy Cor p Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market as a result of consolidation that had taken place in the United Kingdom The acquisitio n of LGObecame appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which was thought to support any further expansion that Powergen might have had in mind Powergen has a market capitalization of billion and PE ratio of according to Yahoo Finance However the company has struggled over the last year Powergens primary subsidiary LGOEnergy saw its profit for decline by percent to million from million As the parent company Powergen saw its profits decline by percent in to million from million although its revenue increased percent to billion up from billion in Keep in mind that Powergens acquisition of LGOwas not completed until December so LGEs earnings will be reflected fully in its parents financial report starting this year If EON were to acquire Powergen it would gain several strategic advantage s EON would no longer be reliant solely on the German market where falling prices and continued consolidation limit competitive opportunities In addition the purchase would give EON a hold on generating assets in the United Kingdom and the comparatively lowcost power production millio n customers and various business operations that LGOoffers in the United States As noted Powergen has acknowledged that it has received approaches from E ON and other companies Based on available reports those other companies ar e most likely RWE Germanys largest power supplier and a rival of EON Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise French megautilities and an unnamed American power company Enron or Southern Energy would be my best guess However word from its management team is that Powergen is not interested in getting tied up as a purchased entity in merger or acquisition proceedings at thi s time as it may be planning additional purchases of its own in the United States On the other hand the rationale for Powergen to be sold to a company like EON is taking shape British restructuring law has forced large generators to sell power stations to reduce any likelihood of market power As a resul t Powergen has morphed from a pure UK generating company to a broadbased company engaged in telecommunications gas and distribution services Ed Wallis Powergens CEO has stated that presently it has become very difficult for Powergen to compete with larger rivals in an enlarged Europea n market As noted Powergens strategy over the last year has been one of further expansion in the United States and the purchase of LGOwas perhaps more expensive than Powergen had planned In order to make further US acquisitions Powergen needs adequate capital or equity in order to finance the acquisition something that has become more difficult since its purchas e of LGE Nevertheless if the deal takes place it will require regulatory approval i n the United States from FERC the SEC and the Kentucky Public Service Commission among other possible agencies The climate for US energy industry mergers and acquisitions has become rather turbulent in recent weeks Three highprofile mergers Entergy FPL Group Con Edison Northeast Utilities and Sierra Pacific Resources Portland General have a ll encountered difficulties that could derail their pending deals In addition according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal announced worldwid e mergers and acquisitions this year totaled billion as of March which is about onethird of the volume during the same period last year Also about merger deals have been withdrawn from the market compared with deals that were withdrawn for the same period last year according to the WSJ report Analysts that have been closely watching the potential for an EON Powerg en deal say that Powergens US operations in LGOcould prove to be a major stumbling block for the two companies and that EON may find US regulato ry requirements to be much more stringent than those in Europe Specifically the SEC has strict rules regarding what kinds of companies can own public utilities a category into which LGOfalls and EONs diverse nonpower operations may send some red flags to American regulators Consequently although EON appears rather confident that this deal will be completed rather soon Powergens reported resistance and US regulatory obstacles m ay thwart this yettobeformallyannounced partnership An

of electricity and naturalgas marketing giant Enron Corp NYSE ENE slid further on Thursday March amid broader weakness in energy stocks despite a reassurance from the company that it would hit its previously stated target earnings for this year Enro n was off or percent at on March after falling percent on March So far this year Enrons stock is down about percent vers us a percent decline for Standard Poors utilities index and a percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average Analysis Over the last several weeks a growing number of smaller emergin g energy companies have felt the impact from the nations struggling economy and the likelihood of an impending recession Just recently startup companies such as Silicon Energy and Hydrogen Burner Technology have withdrawn their IPO plans citing an anemic stock market and the lack of positive cash flow A look across the stock market can send shivers down th e spines of most energy company CEOs as the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below the point for the first time in two years and the Nasd aq composite remains percent off of its March high of putting the economy in bear market territory However while the stocks and public offerings of smaller energy companies may crash and burn the giant energy company that is Enron Corp typically has seemed immune from the high and low tides of the US economy Over the course of Enron shares returned percent and traded at roughly times trailing earnings reportedly more than times the multiple of its some of its main competitors or the S Nevertheless Enrons winning streak in the stock market may be eroding as the waves that are crashing around many other energy companies may also be dragging Enron into the same whirlpool For perspective Enrons closest competitors across its various business lines Williams and Dynegy also appear to be taking the hit from the bear market Williams NYSE WMB saw its stock decline or percent to on March Dynegy NYSE DYN saw its stock drop or percent to Of course of the three companies Enron wields the highest PE ratio at and largest market capitalization at billion By comparison Williams has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion while Dynegy has a PE ratio of and market capitalization of billion Analysts that keep a close eye on Enrons stock say the sudden decline is n ot a reflection of any new business developments at the company but rather a market that is struggling in general and a growing disenchantment among investors in technology and telecommunications in particular This may be having a unique impact on Enron as the company attributed much of its stron g stock performance over the last year to its growing expansion into the telecommunications broadband market Just as the company has achieved unparalleled success in electricity and naturalgas trading for the last year Enron has been developing a highspeed broadband communications networ k to support its planned move into bandwidth trading and marketing Enron projects a billion worldwide market for communications bandwidth tradi ng and services by and the valuation of its own broadband business at a share or billion The company plans to trade excess bandwidth capacity and in order to do so is constructing its own network which cost s a lot of money Enron has acknowledged that it intends to sell between billion and billion in assets over the next months in order to reduce debt and support the new business in broadband among other businesses in pulp and paper data storage and advertising Thus much is riding on the anticipated success of the broadband business and Enrons role in it Up to this point confidence in both the industry a nd the company have run high Some analysts have reported that interest in Enrons expansion into this area validated by investor interest in new technologies in general drove an percent rise in the companys share price last year Yet once again the tide may be turning Investors no longer seem to be as enthralled by emerging technologies that have not resulted in bottomline profits much as the year before ecommerce stocks also found that their day in the sun ended rather abruptly And although nearly every other Enron line of business has turned to gold its broadband business has remained immature In fact for yearend Enron Broadband Services reported a million IBIT loss reflecting start up costs to build the new business The company seems to have anticipated the slow growth of its broadband business In fact Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling did not appear concerned over the loss and said that it took between five a nd six years for the companys naturalgas business to develop standardized contracts and increase liquidity Skilling has said that these numbers do n ot dilute his belief that bandwidth trading will soon become a strong performe r for the company While Skilling remains optimistic about the potential of t he broadband business investors may not be as patient Note that while Enron s broadband business took a loss for the company as a whole reported a percent increase in earnings per diluted share to and a percent increase in net income to billion In late January Enron had increased its earnings target for to between and per share In response to the sudden drop in stock price an d speculation that its broadband business would receive new pressure to becom e profitable Enron issued a brief statement reiterating that it remains ver y comfortable with the earnings estimate An Enron spokesperson also ma de references to information in the market that is inaccurate suggesting th at any speculation about problems in its broadband business were unfounded including potential layoffs at the broadband unit According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom investors polled by First Call Thompson Financial ar e still expecting Enron to turn in earnings in a range of to for Nevertheless despite Enrons reassurances that it remains on track to meet its earnings estimate the companys stock continued to drop As noted investors began to put downward pressure on the stock pushing it to as of March below its week low of and far below its week hi gh of Some of the decline may be attributed to the fact that many investors remai n unclear about what it is that Enron does exactly According to a March article in Fortune magazine entitled Is Enron Overpriced some Wall Streeters are skeptical about how the company makes its money and the lack of clarity has often raised a red flag about Enrons pricey stock The skepticism did not seem to steal any of Enrons thunder in a bull market b ut that could all change quickly in a bear market Enron may in fact exacerbat e Wall Streets distrust in its business model by not fully disclosing its financial records for what it deems competitive reasons The Fortune report which was published before Enrons stock began to decline also indicated that investors are concerned about Enrons debt Although the company continues to promise a reduction in its debt load Enron carried a net billion debt at the end of September Again although investor s may have been able to look the other way from Enrons debt during a strong economy it appears that investors will use a finetooth comb to examine th e companys financial records during the increasingly unstable economy Moreover in addition to a possible impatience with the growth of technolog y and telecommunications stocks investors may also be concerned that a globa l economic slowdown could reduce demand for energy as a whole resulting in lower commodity prices Drops in the stocks of Dynegy and Williams possibly validate this theory Enron was quick to quell rumors that its stock began to fall as a result of problems with its broadband unit Looking at the big picture it appears reasonable that the broadband business on its own has not caused the drop i n Enrons stock Rather Enron shares have mostly likely fallen as a result o f several factors Yes investors appear to now be less likely to support new technologies and telecommunications businesses that have not proven to be presently profitable In addition Enron is in many ways an enigma In an unstable economy the uncertainty surrounding Enrons business could prompt an unprecedented hesitation about the companys business model And lastly Enron is not alone among energy stocks and stocks in general that are weathering the fallout of the stock market On the bright side Enron still remains a very puissant company despite the sudden drop in its stock price Enrons PE ratio of is still quite strong when compared against othe r energy companies In addition Enron is a company full of surprises and it is doubtful that any temporary drop in its stock price will keep the compan y down for long An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

IssueAlert for March New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies Plans for New Power Plant by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire Sithe Energies Inc announced that in respon se to issues raised by local residents the company is reassessing its plans f or a power generating facility in Ramapo New York The alternative currently under review is a smaller peaking facility which would use no water for generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and emergencies to help ensure reliability of the regions electricity supply Originally slated as an MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga s the alternative plant is a MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas Analysis Sithe Energies original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav e been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects of the plant Ramapo is located miles north of New York City Chief amon g the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes In response to the concerns of residents Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output Unfortunately Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t he very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York has some rather serious power supply concerns For background it is important to note that Exelon Corp owns nearly half of Sithe Energies In December Exelon acquired percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi percent Marubeni Corp percent and Sithe Management percent The acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon Jim McGowan Sithe senior vice president for development referenced the ro le that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki ng unit in the area Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are addressed McGowan said Weve listened carefully to residents concern s and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean less visible and uses no water for generation McGowan further noted that the new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil e fulfilling the regions growing need for electricity during times of peak consumer demand As an independent power producer Sithe Energies owns power plants across t he United States and internationally The company has a generation presence in such states as California Colorado Massachusetts New Jersey and Pennsylvania among several others In New York Sithe Energies owns four rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately M W Batavia MW Independence Station Scriba NY MW Massena MW Ogdensburg MW and Sterling Sherill NY MW In addition t o the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo Sithe Energies also has proposed Heritage Station an MW power plant located near Lake Ontario A full siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete However projects under MW are not required to go through the extensive environmental impact statement which generally involves a detailedand time consumingexamination of alternatives The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further Ne w York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum heightened by the ongoing problems in California Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state However at the same time environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies Ramapo plant which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t o generate power While other new plants are being planned in New York realistically it will be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit y to ease concerns about shortages Meanwhile the state enters this summers season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands Ne w York City like other areas of the Northeast the Midwest and California i s in a very serious situation reported a member of the New York Public Service Commission to the New Assembly While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City A November FERC report entitled Investigation of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlights specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study says Li ke northern California which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti es of power on constrained transmission lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densel y populated and heavily residential it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes i s generated by the city New plants are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be MW short of its required MW generating capacit y needs this summer That projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added This years demand is expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts According to the FERC report New York City s load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incit y capacity along with imports to meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall Long Island has a potential MW shortfall to meet the required MW of power The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with in the next few months the state could suffer some of Californias problems However despite the need for additional power generation in the state the intense public scrutiny of Sithes plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants throughout the state For instance the New York Power Authoritys NYPA plan to install ten MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi on from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group NYIRG which has sued the NYPA charging that it circumvented the environmental review process for siting new plants In addition FERCs report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were approximately projects proposed to be built in New York State as of November The report indicated that only one of these projects is likely to be built in the next three to four years Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit McGowan has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy requirements If it does it will make the same mistakes for which Californ ia is now paying a tremendous price Along the same lines William Muesler CE O of the New York ISO recently said that to avoid a replication of Californias market meltdown New York must move quickly to build more powe r plants Muesler cited that MW of new power plant capacity percent more than is currently available must be constructed in New York by o r shortages will become likely pushing up prices and increasing the odds of rolling blackouts However despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants not in my back yard has been a common response in New York Even New Jerseys acting Governor Donald T DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos e opposing new power plants in the region DiFrancesco reportedly told a meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th at he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec ts in New York and New Jersey Included in the task force are members of DiFrancescos own staff the state Department of Environmental Protection a nd the Attorney Generals Office Moreover although California offers a clear picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate supply New York appears to be heading down a similar path Although California and New York have different restructuring models one market factor is the same in both states supply that cannot meet demand We know the toll that this inequity has had on California Is it only a matter of time before New York suffers the same consequences An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

IssueAlert for March Dissension at FERC Commission Divided On Price Caps Future Leadership by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters March The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout s and price spikes The three FERC commissioners who regulate interstate electricity markets testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of blackouts Analysis Since the start of deregulation in the early s FERCs variou s positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been fairly consistent Despite its changing members as a whole the fivemember commission with two positions currently open has taken a handsoff approach to its regulatory role preferring instead to allow free market forces to drive competition in the energy industry In fact Curt Hbert appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush told me in an interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe n FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether However significant structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since January dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker A s the federal regulatory body for the energy industry FERC has the responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country Th e debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu re leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt At the House of Representatives meeting on March Hbert a Republican reiterated his objections to price caps Chairman Hbert has maintained his longstanding opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do longterm damage In January Hbert told me I have seen no evidence th at price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or regional level Hbert is willing to consider them as one possibility among other shortterm resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California Reuters reported that Hbert said at the hearings that such controls are n ot a longterm solution and would discourage the industry from building more power plants to supply the West Rather Hbert believes that power generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants both in California and elsewhere Hbert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as saying Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand thus correcting the current imbalance Capping prices through regulation or legislation will have exactly the opposite effect Despite Hberts opposition to wholesale price caps fellow Commissioner William Massey a Democrat asserted that California and the western region were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary time out or price cap was needed to let the market stabilize The commission must act forcefully and decisively to reassure market participants policymakers and consumers that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju st and reasonable rates Massey said In addition Massey reportedly also sai d that such a price cap could be calculated on a generatorbygenerator basi s at each generators variable operating cost plus a reasonable capacity adder perhaps in the range of per megawatt hour Massey reiterated th e severity of the crisis in California noting that whereas wholesale power i n the state cost billion in it increased to billion in and could exceed billion for Rounding out the commissions divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt a Democrat who said that all possible options should be analyze d and debated Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric e controls Chairman Hberts stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investmen t in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power produce rs to other regions of the country and further away from California The Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California The only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price caps Abraham said Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin g is scheduled for later this week Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton a Texas Republican noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o r not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the next few weeks This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE RC over major issues facing the energy industry The commission also became divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs FERCs December vote on the Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be regulated ThenCommissioner Hbert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT O met FERC guidelines for RTO formation and was the sole member who successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an RTO However Hbert stood as a minority The other three commissioners at FERC at the time Hoecker Massey and Breathitt preferred to wield a tight er regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current transmission policy While Hbert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti es and letting free market principles rule the other commissioners at FERC appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities Meanwhile speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat Wood III chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to the position of FERC chairman Hbert was named chairman in February by Preside nt Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican administration took office Jan At that time the president did not indicate that Hberts appointment as chair was temporary Wood was appoint ed by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in and played a primary role i n the development of that states restructuring plan Electric choice begins in Texas on June with the start of a pilot program and then the market opens fully to competition on Jan The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate d There are two Republican openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush As noted presently Hbert is the only Republican among the current three members Wood reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas governor has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the Republican openings on FERC for some time However the Washington Post and Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman forcing Hbert to step back into a role as commissioner The report in Reuters indicated that Hbert a friend and protg of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss is personally fighting the planned move The nomination would require Senate confirmation Moreover as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC th e issue of price caps remains unresolved The debate over price caps also has divided others involved strictly along party lines Generally speaking Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha t has been called price gouging on the part of energy companies Republica ns believe that the government including FERC and the Bush administration should maintain a handsoff approach and allow the marketplace to determi ne prices Speaking from a nonpartisan point of view some economists now question whetherand not just howderegulation of electricity markets should occur at all For instance Alfred E Kahn the Cornell University economis t who helped deregulate other industries says that electricity markets may n ot lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in retaining vertical integration among utilities allowing a single regulated power company to produce transmit and distribute electricity The movemen t toward reregulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate over wholesale price caps Yet in any event once again California remains the catalyst for decisionmaking on this issue As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in to a third day in the state federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a definitive position on wholesale price caps for California which of course would set a precedent for the rest of the country As the industrys top agency in charge of wholesale markets FERCs ultimate position on price ca ps carries tremendous influence Despite the apparent dissension within the commission and possible changes in its leadership FERC is presently challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b e conducted or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this area An archive

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Citing an emergency shortage of electricity across the state California power officials ordered rolling blackouts on Monday March in a move to avoid toppling the power grid The California Independent System Operator ISO which manages about percent of the transmission grid serving the states million residents ordered the blackouts shortly before noon Pacific time and said they would likely last through pm Pacific time on March It was the first time rolling blackouts have hit the southern hal f of the state and the third time this year in the north following two days of outages on Jan and Analysis Despite all the recent efforts taken by Calif Gray Davis to solv e the states severe energy problems it now seems inevitable that California is headed toward another volatile summer full of power problems One of the states fundamental problemssupply that cannot keep up with demandi s being addressed by the governor and the Bush administration and is projected to be solved within the next two or three years However the new power supply that is being planned to serve the state is not coming online quickly enoug h to stave off problems for this summer In addition the current rolling blackouts facing the state are worse than previously enforced cutbacks and have impacted almost all parts of the state as opposed to more confined areas The most recent problem appears to have resulted from unusually warm weathe r in the southern part of the state that drove up use of airconditioned powe r This left the state as a whole with limited reserves at a time when power plant maintenance and a lack of hydropower already was causing problems in Northern California Reportedly about MW of power were lost due to a transformer fire at a Southern California plant and other idled plants acro ss the state In addition about to MW of production from qualifyi ng facilities QFs was unavailable on the day of the rolling blackouts The Q Fs that were offline typically have produced only small amounts of power under contract to the states three major utilities However the QFs have stoppe d producing in recent weeks as a result of the financial problems of Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison and the fact that they ha ve been paid only a small percentage of what they are owed for power previousl y produced Under normal circumstances the QFs can generate as much as percent of the states electricity needs As a result the California ISO issued a Stage emergency alert the highe st level of emergency indicating that power reserves had fallen below percent In addition Pacific Gas Electric Co implemented blackouts acro ss Northern California including San Francisco and the Silicon Valley Southe rn California Edison turned off the lights in neighborhoods around Los Angeles Together the two utilities serve about million Californians and operat ed the rolling blackouts by moving through a series of predetermined blocks of customers Operators at substations were directed to turn off power for a block of customers for about to minutes then restore service and mov e on to a subsequent block of customers Public safety outlets such as police and fire stations were not included in the rolling blackouts although othe r public services such as traffic lights were affected by the outages While the rolling blackouts occurred Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham spok e at the US Chamber of Commerce and acknowledged that California clearly wi ll not have enough power supply to meet demand this summer Abraham said that the state will need about MW to meet summer demand while only MW of generation is expected to be available Abraham also reiterated that the Bush administration will present a very comprehensive and balanced energy plan in the coming weeks one that most likely will focus on increasing domestic supply and reducing US dependence on foreign sources for oil as well as conservation efforts Theres really only three thing s you can do about a difference between supply and demand Abraham said On e is to conserve more The second is to import more And the third is to produce more I think we want to focus more on conserving more and producin g more rather than depending more on other countries However only days earlier the Bush administration warned that electricity blackouts in California appear inevitable this summer but continued to issue a strong statement of opposition to addressing the problem with wholesale price caps In fact Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will discourage investment in new generation at a time when it is most needed and drive power producers to other regions of the country and further away from California The Bush administrations position on price caps is in contrast with what appears to be a change in policy from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC which historically has also opposed any regional price caps A report that originated in the Wall Stree t Journal last week indicated that FERC is leaning toward setting tighter limits on the price that generators can charge for power in California particularly on hot summer days when shortages could be acute Reportedly a new rule from FERC on wholesale price caps would set maximum prices during electrical emergencies based on each plants actual operating costs Yet Abraham remains firm that price caps will do nothing to abate the blackouts for which Californians appear to be headed this summer At a Sena te hearing on price control legislation last week Abraham said Let me be clear on this Any action we take must either help increase supply or reduc e demand Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand In fact they will aggravate the supply crisis Thus we return to the fundamental problem that will continue to cause problems in California and other areas the need for new power supply and time limitations associated with establishing that supply In my IssueAlert for March I addressed the discrepancy regarding Californias power needs versus power supply The conclusions I made at that time now appear to be further validated During the month of Augusttypically the hottest mont h in Californiapeak daily demand for power in the California ISO territory i s expected to hit about MW The states three IOUsPGE SCE and Sa n Diego Gas Electricstill generate about MW from their remaining power plants and have longterm contracts from wind solar and other energy sourc es that gain them an additional MW of power Gov Davis has established that about MW from the longterm contracts will be available this summer In addition back in February Davis announced a plan to expedite t he approval and siting process for new power plants in the state which he promised would bring MW online by July an ambitious goal that may or may not materialize Altogether assuming that all of these projections are reliable the total comes to about MW that we know should be available in California thi s summer leaving the state about MW short for its power supply needs As noted Abraham has suggested a California supply demand imbalance of MW of demand versus MW of supply which would make for a slightly less severe scenario However Abraham has not fully detailed the data on which he has based his projections Nevertheless no matter how the actual numbers shake out most everyone agrees that the summer prognosis is not good for California Rather than questioning if additional blackouts will occur the ongoing debate relates to how severe the anticipated outages will become and how long they will last before additional power supply can be established in the state And althou gh today marks the first day of spring and summer is officially still weeks away Californias problems have already started in full force According t o statements from the California ISO some of the power supply that had been offline due to mechanical problems during the day on March could be back online by March However that will account for only about to MW which is not nearly enough to offset additional problems for California thi s week assuming that temperatures in the state remain warm Yet as one energy executive once commented California continues to apply BandAids on hemorrhaging wounds While the state continues to send out its SOS signal what is needed is a reliable longterm solution that will provide a substantial amount of power to Californians There is little chan ce of this solution being found before this summer so as the temperature continues to rise on the West Coast California energy officials will be challenged to contain the damage of the states ongoing energy crisis An archive list of previous

Group Entergy Merger May Be in Trouble by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis FPL Group Inc NYSE FPL and Entergy Corp NYSE ETR whose proposed merger would create the largest power distribution company in the United States million customers said their deal has hit some significant snags In a joint statement Juno Beach Flabased FPL Group and Louisianabased Entergy said certain issues have arisen in connection with their pending merger including governance structurevaluerelated issues a nd integration of the two companies going forward The companies said they wi ll be meeting in the near future to address the issues but did not elaborate They added that they would have no further comment on the status of the merger at the present time Analysis FPL Group and Entergy join what appears to be a growing list of companies experiencing problems with pending mergers Just within the last month Con Edison and Northeast Utilities announced significant problems related to their proposed partnership that most likely will find resolution only in a courtroom Following that we heard about problems surrounding Sierra Pacific Resources ability to finance its pending purchase of Portla nd General from Enron However the fact that the merger of equals between F PL Group and Entergy may not proceed is big news as it represents the largest partnership among energy companies that the US energy industry has ever witnessed First let me provide some background FPL Group and Entergy Corp announce d their merger in July The billion partnership reportedly will crea te the largest power company in the nation eclipsing the nowcompleted merger between PECO and Commonwealth Edison that created Exelon Corp The new company which will be named at a later date will own and operate generati ng capacity of more than megawatts and as noted will serve more than million customers Although this is referred to as a merger of equals FP L is purchasing Entergy FPL Group shareholders will own percent of the common equity of the combined company and Entergy shareholders will own percent The benefits of this merger are too many to name here but some advantagesbeyond the staggering earnings potentialcertainly stand o ut First the combined company will be a leader in wholesale generation and on e of the nations largest independent power producers with nearly megawatts of unregulated generating capacity Related to this is Entergys announced joint venture with Koch Industries under which Entergy gains miles of naturalgas pipeline assets and becomes a world leader in weather derivatives Second the two companies come together with an important affinity in their competitive approaches Both have divested thei r noncore businesses and are focused on expanding utility operations and generation businesses Along these lines both companies support emissionfree energy with Entergy being particularly strong in nuclear and FPL Group being strong in renewable energies particularly wind Third th e regulated business of Florida Power LightFPL Groups subsidiaryis in a strong growth mode Today the utility serves more customers than i t did in In alone FPL added nearly new accountsa per cent increase over Fourth FPL Group is the stronger of the two with regar d to telecom and the companys subsidiary FPL FiberNet will gain considerabl y from new opportunities available in Entergys service territory Overall t he combined forces of Entergy and FPL Group create a multidiversified company potentially strong not only in the distribution side of the business but wholesale generation as well as trading telecom and renewable energy The pending merger between the two companies had already experienced some previous setbacks related to its timetable for completion In January an Administrative Law Judge ALJ issued a procedural schedule that called for hearings related to the merger to begin in October which was expected to delay the merger closing by three to six months Entergy filed a motion for reconsideration of the schedule In midFebruary a new ALJ ruling move d up to July the Louisiana Public Service Commissions scheduled hearings on the merger returning the regulatory proceedings to their original month timetable Consequently prior to this latest announcement of new problems associated with the merger the partnership between FPL Group and Entergy w as scheduled to close by the end of this year With that overview we can speculate on the reasons why the proposed merger is hitting some snags Keep in mind that FPL is the buying partner in the merger and more than likely would be the company to contest certain element s of the deal that may have been altered since the merger was first announced From the start it was understood that the new headquarters would be locate d in Florida and that FPL Group would gain majority ownership of the new company In the announcement of issues related to the merger the two companies identified integration of the two companies going forward as on e of the factors This could be an indication that one of the companies is seeking to modify previously agreedupon terms of the merger contract In addition the companies made reference to governance structure valuerelated issues and integration of the two companies This of course could mean many different things However one major issue that may be impacting the merger was revealed in a recent report which suggested that Entergy Wholesale Operations the nonutility power development marketing and trading subsidiary of Entergy is considering the divestiture of its tw o UK generating assets Damhead Creek and Saltend According to Power Finan ce Risk power traders familiar with inside knowledge have reported that the Entergy subsidiary is considering the sale of the units which could earn u p to billion in the secondary market Both units are combinedcycle gas turbines and together represent about MW Damhead Creek generates abo ut MW and is located in Kent England Saltend generates about MW an d is located in Yorkshire According to the report Entergy has declined to comment on the matter However rival traders say the possible divestiture may reflect the tough economics of operating gasfired plants in the United Kingdom and Entergy s preference for more lucrative markets in Southern and Eastern Europe As noted one of the main appeals of the pending merger between FPL Group and Entergy is that it will create a company that is a leader in wholesale with nearly megawatts of unregulated generating capacity At least that w as the blueprint at the time the two companies entered into their agreement A ny plans to divest assets on either side of the negotiating table clearly changes the deal and may in fact be one of the valuerelated issues that has complicated this deal Many mergers of equals also include pooling of interest clauses restricting either party from altering its value up or down by a specified percentage Certainly the divestiture of assets could have an impact on the value of Entergys portfolio The announcement of potential problems associated with the merger was not made until early this morning so it is too early to assess any impact that the announcement might have on the companies stocks On March FPL shares closed at while Entergy finished at As of midmorning on March FPL shares had fallen to and Entergy shares had dropped to about Both companies are considered stocks to watch today as further impact from the problems associated with the merger may become more apparent An archive list of

article Australia Jewel in the Crown for Some US Investors at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Oil and NaturalGas Shortages Will They Create a Winter of Discontent By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD US retail energy fuel costs already high by historical standards are expected to remain high this winter due to crude prices that are projected to remain at levels unseen since the Gulf War said the Department of Energ y on Friday In addition households that use natural gas are likely to see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills as well accord ing to the Energy Information Administration EIA The agency said US reside nts can expect heating expenditures to increase by percent for heating oil and propane and percent for natural gas ANALYSIS Despite common belief to the contrary there is a direct correlat ion between the price cycles of oil and natural gas The fact that there are legitimate concerns surrounding the availability of both power sources gives validity to the warnings of price increases this winter When fuel prices are low and naturalgas supplies are abundant there is arguably little connection between the two However the present situation as we head into winter is the exact oppositehigh oil prices and a comprised supply of natural gas leaving the two unquestionably intertwined As energ y users opt to switch from oil to natural gas this affects natural gas suppl y and raises gas prices How did we arrive at this alarming situation which may have been justifiab ly labeled an energy crisis Regarding oil in the worldwide oil indust ry witnessed a decline in oil pricesspawned in part by the economic proble ms in Asiawhich hit a low of less than a barrel in March Oil pro ducers voluntarily initiated decreased production which unsurprisingly started a swift climb in prices in as demand started to increase in a rejuvenated Asia and the United States Together this has created a volatile mix of substantially higher crude oil prices lower inventories and increased demand Even though OPEC has made promises of up to million additional barrels of crude oil per daya result of political pressure put on it by the United States and other countriesit may not be able to force its me mbers to increase production as obviously its in the best interest of oil producers to keep supplies tight and prices high In addition even if they materiali ze these increases promised by OPEC may not be enough to meet growing demand This is alarming as the United States is very reliant on foreign oil which already accounts for about half of US oil use The high price of oil has sent many customers looking for natural gas only to find that it is also in questionable supply Most reports suggest that natural gas heats about percent of all US homes The imbalance between supply and demand found in the oil industry is also found in natura l gas resulting in a projected to percent increase in heating bills this winter Over the last month prices for naturalgas futures have climb ed to record levels of more than per million Btus Yet unlike oil most of the blame placed on low supply for natural gas focuses on the United States rather than other countries A reported percent of federal lands have been placed off limits to naturalgas drillers leaving as many as million acres out of a total of billion available but restricted for naturalgas expansion The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibite d drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground At the same time EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years placing an increasingly high dependence on natural gas even though alternative fuels are not necessarily available to serve as a substitute Given the connection between oil and natural gas any successful attempt to lower oil prices would in turn help to lower naturalgas prices The ability to rely more heavily on oil once again would decrease the need for fuel switching thus reducing the present burden on natural gas Toward this end in late September President Clinton authorized the release of million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR the nations emergency oil stockpile The presidents action caused additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc y supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies Others said the million barrels would do little to ease the problem and that it would take between and million barrels a day for one month to reduce current crude oil prices So what is the solution As noted the issue has become politically polariz ed Within their campaign proposals Gov Bush proposes spending billion to open up US energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources Specifically Bush has proposed among other things opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Range which probably contains about billion barrels of oil Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the United States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell sav e a million barrels of oil a day which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to develop fuel cells alternat ive energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve But what is the answer now as winter fast approaches Unfortunately natur al gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into The degree to which the oilgas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter will depend on the weather The colder the temperature the greater the need for heating power sources which will drive up the cost for both oil and natural gas Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter one that in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past winters which were unusually mild due to La NiFa Already temperatures are dipping to surprising lows across the country Considering that it is only early October warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply will be stretched to meet demand which unquestionably will drive up the price of energy bills Looking forward much of what happens from here will depend on which candid ate is elected in November Most within the energy industry agree that more production is the only answer to supply concerns Yet expanding production will not be an easy task especially in an election year This is not an issue that is gaining high priority within Congress as politicians aim to end their session before the presidential election With such exceedingl y opposed candidates the impact that the imminent election will have on future energy policy cannot be underestimated

last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE custom ers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure tempor ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it contin ues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

the efforts of energyrelated companies in the evergrowing field of electronic commerce A sample can be viewed at webinfostorensfProductsInfoGrid DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Online Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass Utilities By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas rates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs ANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heatin g bills that are to percent higher than their bills last winter Domini on East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about more per month for natural gas from November through January And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastwhere low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearbut in the West as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about to an average bill of compar ed to last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in productio n It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand in general has grown to surprising levels Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing opportuni ty and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about per month compared Con Edisons Under its new promotion SmartEnergys plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current naturalgas rates for the next months This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to percent on their energy through the winter months The startup company also is offering United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles credit and signup bonus to entice customers away from Con Edison Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke t prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current rates for months but many others will stick with the company that they know even if their rates increase I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothi ng that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of deregulation In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu lt to beat The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is myHomeKeycom which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use the ir energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only servi ce of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that myHomeKeycom just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check energy efficiency in their homes Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the onlin e providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom Utilitycom has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilityco m plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continue s to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager to grab their own share of the retail market I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital ize on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider s DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Read about SCIENTECHs new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba Chairman and CEO of the Public

<6128072.1075846183218.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-17 04:13:00,Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site Read SCIENTECHs free SourceBook Weekly article Power Traders The Winner s and Losers at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy Inc announced the launch of Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree BB portal and trading site for energy and communications commodities Dynegydirect will be introduced to Dynegy customers in a phasedin rollout that started on Oct with online trading commencing over the next sever al weeks Through the portal Dynegy customers will have selfservice access to Dynegys bid and offer prices across US power natural gas and naturalgas liquids products UK power and natural gas as well as coal emission allowances weather derivatives international naturalgas liquids and bandwidth will be offered in the coming months ANALYSIS This is a major undertaking for Dynegy but perhaps not very surprising as the company is following many of its competitors into the bigleague online trading market Dynegy is following a trail blazed by the likes of EnronOnline Entergy AEP etc in establishing a portal to enhance liquidity improve customer control and create greater trading efficiency Of the various online trading sites that have been announced Dynegydirect appears most similar to EnronOnlineclearly the leader in the fieldbecause it is principalbased In other words Dynegy will be a participant in all of the transactions either as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect will allow customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone during and following the launch of the site Over the last year Dynegy has identified its strategy as wanting to become a leader in the converging energy and communications business In addition according to Dynegys CEO Chuck Watson the companys goal is to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five years by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others Along with a strident strategy of buildin g merchant plants in areas where demand is growing significantly Dynegy presumably plans to now use its trading portal to market the power it has either generated itself or bought on the wholesale market I spoke late yesterday afternoon with Blake Young Dynegys chief informati on officer and president of Dynegy Global Technologies about the new site and how it will compete against such stiff competition First Young said that Dynegydirect is a component of a broader strategy to support Dynegy s comprehensive electronic business efforts What this means is that Dynegydirect ultimately will be much larger than just a trading portal including such other electronic businesses as eprocurement and energy supply chain management The portal will be particularly customerdriven in that it should provide many windows of opportunity for Dynegy customers to maximize their manageme nt capabilities Dynegy has been planning a trading operation for some time its growth as a power generator and marketer has been an indication that Dynegy recognized new trends in the energy industry You may recall that a few months back Dynegy teamed with Williams in investing million each for minority equity stakes in eSpeed Inc As noted in SCIENTECHs IssueAlert from Sept eSpeed is investing million in TradeSpark which plans to create electronic marketplaces for natural gas electricity coal weather derivatives nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission credits TradeSpark is using the infrastructure and capabilities of eSpeed In other words eSpeed is TradeSparks enabler As an investor in eSpeed Dynegy stands to profit from TradeSparks prelaunch market valuation of million At this point it is not clear if Dynegy intends for Dynegydirect to be a competitor to TradeSpark as Dynegy stands to profit from both trading operations How does this all relate to Dynegydirect According to Young Dynegy is pursuing commodity trading along two venues The first is a proprietary onetomany format in which Dynegy will participate in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller This operation will be conducted on the Dynegydirect portal The second venue is an anonymous manytomany format in which Dynegy will participate along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation will take place on TradeSpark which became operational in early October Dynegy is a participating member in TradeSpark along with Coral Energy Dominion Koch Energy Trading TXU Energy Trading Willi ams Energy Marketing and Trading and Cantor Fitzgerald Entergy also plans to come on board as a member and investor once its venture with Koch closes later this year Other key attributes to Dynegydirect as identified in the announcement of the site are that its highly configurable floors will enable customers to group products in a customized fashion for convenient access In additi on customers can trade on multiple floors simultaneously and the sites realtime price updates will allow them to see prices on all of their floors enablin g them to make immediate decisions on prices and volumes Young said that Dynegy is extremely confident that the portals technology will be well accepted as it is JAVAbased meaning among other things that it is flexible enough to operate between MACs and IBMs and objectoriented While these are important from an IT perspective as would be important to CIO Young perhaps more importantly is that the site offers an opportuni ty for Dynegy to support the growth of its businesses and offers a costefficiency tool for customers In August Dynegy announced that it is acquiring Extant a privately held Coloradobased communications solutions and ecommerce company Extants primary line of business is in providing connectivity solutions and broadba nd capacity to communications businesses and information providers enabling them to exchange information and provide voice data and video services to their customers The acquisition will mark Dynegys first significant penetration into the telecommunications sector While not directly related to this new portal the acquisition of Extant is relevant because Dynegy intends to eventually trade broadband capacity on the site Extants broadb and capacity will help to support Dynegys trading of this commodity While the move to online trading is a smart and almost inevitable decisio n for Dynegy and other energy companies wanting to remain competitive the competition and risk associated with this venture are formidable Clearly Dynegy has found a market edge with its eSpeed TradeSpark affiliation TradeSpark is already up and running as compared to many announced trading sites that have launch dates next year In addition TradeSpark is creating a large liquidity pool by bringing together several mediums including the Internet voice brokering and eSpeeds millisecond private global network The manytomany format which Dynegy is pursuing through TradeSpar k is an obvious route for the company to follow and one with considerably less risks associated with it On the other hand building its own Dynegydirect in which Dynegy is the principal player sounds like a Herculean task For perspective Enron was the first company that came out of the gate with an online energy trading portal EnronOnline has a month leadal ong with transactions in excess of billionahead of Dynegy or any comp any that is just now developing a trading portal It appears that Dynegy plans to build Dynegydirect from the ground up unlike its involvement in TradeSpark which is already up and running This could become a lengthy and costly endeavor As I finished writing this analysis Dynegy reported thirdquarter earnings of per share In particular Dynegy reported that recurring net income from Dynegy Marketing and Trading increased to million representing percent of Dynegys consolidated net income compared to million in the third quarter of Obviously Dynegys commodities marketing and trading operation is on a very significant growth mode The launch of Dynegydirectalong with ongoing participation in TradeSparkis a k ey element of this growth DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Chairman President and CEO of American Electric Power is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Department of Energy will have more than million for fuel cell related programs in the new fiscal year million above the presidents request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed upon million for stationary fuel cells million more than request ed and approved the full request of million for transportation fuel cell research and million for buildings ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than expect ed should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel cells Although generally considered the favorite of low zero emission energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently availab le in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since batteries were discovered years ago but the high cost of producing them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest million in Energy Conversion Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals significant support from the federal government In addition warnings about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as oppose d to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without burni ng producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need recharg ing although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero pollution are very appealing Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of generation available for widespread use by or Under the DOE grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In addition the funding allocates million to transportation fuel cell research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile application s The million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy pe fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator for buildings and other research and development Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As custom ers possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional busine ss of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have drama tic financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabam a Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity at a reported efficiency of about percent compared with percent for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system of MercedesBenz Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about million in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the partnership Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke ts for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through distribu ted generation products such as fuel cells These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential for the automotive fuel cell market at billion annually by and as high as billion cumulative for the stationary power markets withi n years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers Yet the distributed generation market should become much tighter once fuel cells become commercially available something that this hefty new grant from the US government should push forward DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD El Paso Global Networks plans to spend up to billion in the next few years on telecom acquisitions Find

connection to EnronOnline and receives equity investmen t from PGE Find out more about SCIENTECHS ECommerce InfoGrid at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Discover a world of utilities information in our new ezine SourceBook Online

<3047002.1075846187213.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-30 03:22:00,SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December LADWP Continues to Shine Despite Californias Dark Period By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters California Gov Gray Davis billion dollar plan to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators Legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill One Assembly official called the SCE bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years Analysis Even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible The only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov Davis and SCE is the cashstrapped utility California energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems Thus despite the hype with which Gov Davis announced this rescue plan for SCE California legislatorsboth Republicans and Democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands As it becomes apparent that the California Legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that Gov Davis offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to California residents For background on the details of Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE please reference my IssueAlert from In a nutshell the state of California agreed to buy SCEs mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the systems book value SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability Both the California Legislature and the CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug or else the agreement is terminated In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one o f New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts t o support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO which has run the states wholesale power market since The NYSEG report titled New York States Electr ic Energy Crisis and NYSEGs Comprehensive Solution criticizes the NYISO fo r not giving power consumers price certainty in the transition from local monopolies to an open competitive market Analysis New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener gy markets as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou t an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season However unlike California which basically faces a power supply problem th at can be improved over time New York arguably suffers from a more severe and permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved Like its West Coast counterpart New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance a nd local resistance that thwarts new generation development However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin ue to take their own toll on the stability of the market Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o n each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe r As noted in its new report NYSEG a subsidiary of Energy East NYSE EAS is especially critical of NYISO which it says has contributed to soaring wholesale prices in New York NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining unrealistic goals for new power supply not providing accurate price signal s to energy customers and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems Yet beyond the finger pointing some essential facts can be established o n which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree According to data included in the NYISO report between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state increased only by MW New York has not brought a new plant online sin ce when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven year s since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate In addition New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks Deficie nt transmission systems in central New York around New York City and at the outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than can be imported into the state New York City is relatively isolated from t he transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o n citybased power supply New York Citys load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incity capacity along with imports t o meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall These projections presume normal weather conditions If New York experiences a warmerthannormal summer th e outlook gets even worse Further according to a report from New Yorks State Attorney General between and capital improvements to New Yorks transmission syste m dropped from million per year to million per year At the presen t time only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is scheduled A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut would provide Long Island with about MW of additional power and increas e its import capacity by about percent Unless this transmission expansion is expedited it is not scheduled for operation until Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York most certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th e use of air conditioners pushing demand to annual highs While NYSEG and th e NYISO may agree on the nature of New Yorks problems a contentious debate has emerged with regard to finding a solution In its own proposal release d in early March the NYISO focused on building new generation expediting siting processes improving transmission lines and conservation efforts I n one of its key proposals the NYISO urged the creation of MW of new electricity roughly percent of New Yorks peak demand by with up to MW of that generation being made available by the end of NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for falling short in its assessment o f the magnitude of the crisis and issued its own proposals in its recent report For instance NYSEG officials said that NYISO had grossly oversimplified the situation and that considering the tenuous state of power construction in New York the objective of establishing MW by was extremely unrealistic In turn NYSEG says that a robust wholesa le electric market will not materialize in New York until assuming that measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately In earl y March NYSEG released the NYSEGPlan outlining six steps which it believe s contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition to a competitive market in New York In summary the NYSEGPlan includes Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants Adding to the states transmission capacity Adding to the states naturalgas supply infrastructure Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers by encouraging interruptible load where feasible and building the technological infrastructure necessary for realtime pricing Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan in which electric rates would be frozen for seven years by July However while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals the same obstacles inherent in New Yorks market might also thwart its own ener gy plan For instance topping the list of NYSEGs six steps is an emphasis on establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and approval process This may be easier said than done As I mentioned in my IssueAlert the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th e lobbying force that community groups in California wield In that column I discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in Ramapo NY from an MW combinedcycle facility to a MW peaking unit due to opposition raised by local residents In addition just yesterday a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort s by the New York Power Authority NYPA to build two MW gasfired generators in the borough of Queens The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to cease all construction on the units and ruled that the power authority violated state environmentalreview laws to its efforts to rush the plant into service by June In response NYPA has said that the plantsalong w ith nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York Cityare need ed to prevent power outages this summer NYPA continues to face fierce opposition from community groups many of them launching lawsuits who do not want the generation units in their neighborhoods Consequently the supply demand imbalance in New York is a very serious matter and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless blackouts occur Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines surrounding New York State and New York City are solved adding new power supply assuming that generation development can move past community opposition would not be enough to bring more balance to the market In the interim conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c an user to abate power outages this summer but again the general public may n ot fully understand the need to reduce their power usage New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for nearterm problems First expedite the building of new generation sources including distribution generation alternatives This assumes that gas lines will be sufficient to import necessary fuel Second allow the economy of New York City to stagnate as a result of the supply demand imbalance which will drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand And third focu s on conservation efforts which again may not work until residents are directly impacted by outages The city may choose a combination of all thre e approaches or decide to focus on just one However to address the immediat e concerns it does not appear that New York has any options besides this threetier approach One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne w York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture Although it is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated divestiture utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur e to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most of their power plants NYSEG the author of the new report on New Yorks power problems is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will remain only in the transmission business This most likely creates a heightened sensitivity on NYSEGs part with regard to the power supply shortages presently facing New York Again we now have two states that represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility model becomes dismantled Of course it is not fair to say that divestiture is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York but taking away a utilitys ability to effectively control is own power supply costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters California Gov Gray Davis billion dollar plan to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators Legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill One Assembly official called the SCE bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years Analysis Even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible The only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov Davis and SCE is the cashstrapped utility California energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems Thus despite the hype with which Gov Davis announced this rescue plan for SCE California legislatorsboth Republicans and Democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands As it becomes apparent that the California Legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that Gov Davis offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to California residents For background on the details of Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE please reference my IssueAlert from In a nutshell the state of California agreed to buy SCEs mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the systems book value SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability Both the California Legislature and the CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug or else the agreement is terminated In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one o f New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts t o support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO which has run the states wholesale power market since The NYSEG report titled New York States Electr ic Energy Crisis and NYSEGs Comprehensive Solution criticizes the NYISO fo r not giving power consumers price certainty in the transition from local monopolies to an open competitive market Analysis New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener gy markets as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou t an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season However unlike California which basically faces a power supply problem th at can be improved over time New York arguably suffers from a more severe and permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved Like its West Coast counterpart New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance a nd local resistance that thwarts new generation development However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin ue to take their own toll on the stability of the market Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o n each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe r As noted in its new report NYSEG a subsidiary of Energy East NYSE EAS is especially critical of NYISO which it says has contributed to soaring wholesale prices in New York NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining unrealistic goals for new power supply not providing accurate price signal s to energy customers and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems Yet beyond the finger pointing some essential facts can be established o n which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree According to data included in the NYISO report between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state increased only by MW New York has not brought a new plant online sin ce when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven year s since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate In addition New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks Deficie nt transmission systems in central New York around New York City and at the outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than can be imported into the state New York City is relatively isolated from t he transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o n citybased power supply New York Citys load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incity capacity along with imports t o meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall These projections presume normal weather conditions If New York experiences a warmerthannormal summer th e outlook gets even worse Further according to a report from New Yorks State Attorney General between and capital improvements to New Yorks transmission syste m dropped from million per year to million per year At the presen t time only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is scheduled A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut would provide Long Island with about MW of additional power and increas e its import capacity by about percent Unless this transmission expansion is expedited it is not scheduled for operation until Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York most certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th e use of air conditioners pushing demand to annual highs While NYSEG and th e NYISO may agree on the nature of New Yorks problems a contentious debate has emerged with regard to finding a solution In its own proposal release d in early March the NYISO focused on building new generation expediting siting processes improving transmission lines and conservation efforts I n one of its key proposals the NYISO urged the creation of MW of new electricity roughly percent of New Yorks peak demand by with up to MW of that generation being made available by the end of NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for falling short in its assessment o f the magnitude of the crisis and issued its own proposals in its recent report For instance NYSEG officials said that NYISO had grossly oversimplified the situation and that considering the tenuous state of power construction in New York the objective of establishing MW by was extremely unrealistic In turn NYSEG says that a robust wholesa le electric market will not materialize in New York until assuming that measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately In earl y March NYSEG released the NYSEGPlan outlining six steps which it believe s contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition to a competitive market in New York In summary the NYSEGPlan includes Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants Adding to the states transmission capacity Adding to the states naturalgas supply infrastructure Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers by encouraging interruptible load where feasible and building the technological infrastructure necessary for realtime pricing Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan in which electric rates would be frozen for seven years by July However while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals the same obstacles inherent in New Yorks market might also thwart its own ener gy plan For instance topping the list of NYSEGs six steps is an emphasis on establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and approval process This may be easier said than done As I mentioned in my IssueAlert the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th e lobbying force that community groups in California wield In that column I discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in Ramapo NY from an MW combinedcycle facility to a MW peaking unit due to opposition raised by local residents In addition just yesterday a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort s by the New York Power Authority NYPA to build two MW gasfired generators in the borough of Queens The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to cease all construction on the units and ruled that the power authority violated state environmentalreview laws to its efforts to rush the plant into service by June In response NYPA has said that the plantsalong w ith nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York Cityare need ed to prevent power outages this summer NYPA continues to face fierce opposition from community groups many of them launching lawsuits who do not want the generation units in their neighborhoods Consequently the supply demand imbalance in New York is a very serious matter and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless blackouts occur Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines surrounding New York State and New York City are solved adding new power supply assuming that generation development can move past community opposition would not be enough to bring more balance to the market In the interim conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c an user to abate power outages this summer but again the general public may n ot fully understand the need to reduce their power usage New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for nearterm problems First expedite the building of new generation sources including distribution generation alternatives This assumes that gas lines will be sufficient to import necessary fuel Second allow the economy of New York City to stagnate as a result of the supply demand imbalance which will drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand And third focu s on conservation efforts which again may not work until residents are directly impacted by outages The city may choose a combination of all thre e approaches or decide to focus on just one However to address the immediat e concerns it does not appear that New York has any options besides this threetier approach One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne w York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture Although it is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated divestiture utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur e to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most of their power plants NYSEG the author of the new report on New Yorks power problems is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will remain only in the transmission business This most likely creates a heightened sensitivity on NYSEGs part with regard to the power supply shortages presently facing New York Again we now have two states that represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility model becomes dismantled Of course it is not fair to say that divestiture is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York but taking away a utilitys ability to effectively control is own power supply costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

connection to EnronOnline and receives equity investmen t from PGE Find out more about SCIENTECHS ECommerce InfoGrid at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Discover a world of utilities information in our new ezine SourceBook Online

Chairman President and CEO of American Electric Power is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Department of Energy will have more than million for fuel cell related programs in the new fiscal year million above the presidents request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed upon million for stationary fuel cells million more than request ed and approved the full request of million for transportation fuel cell research and million for buildings ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than expect ed should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel cells Although generally considered the favorite of low zero emission energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently availab le in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since batteries were discovered years ago but the high cost of producing them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest million in Energy Conversion Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals significant support from the federal government In addition warnings about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as oppose d to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without burni ng producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need recharg ing although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero pollution are very appealing Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of generation available for widespread use by or Under the DOE grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In addition the funding allocates million to transportation fuel cell research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile application s The million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy pe fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator for buildings and other research and development Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As custom ers possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional busine ss of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have drama tic financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabam a Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity at a reported efficiency of about percent compared with percent for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system of MercedesBenz Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about million in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the partnership Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke ts for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through distribu ted generation products such as fuel cells These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential for the automotive fuel cell market at billion annually by and as high as billion cumulative for the stationary power markets withi n years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers Yet the distributed generation market should become much tighter once fuel cells become commercially available something that this hefty new grant from the US government should push forward DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD El Paso Global Networks plans to spend up to billion in the next few years on telecom acquisitions Find

Winner s and Losers at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy Inc announced the launch of Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree BB portal and trading site for energy and communications commodities Dynegydirect will be introduced to Dynegy customers in a phasedin rollout that started on Oct with online trading commencing over the next sever al weeks Through the portal Dynegy customers will have selfservice access to Dynegys bid and offer prices across US power natural gas and naturalgas liquids products UK power and natural gas as well as coal emission allowances weather derivatives international naturalgas liquids and bandwidth will be offered in the coming months ANALYSIS This is a major undertaking for Dynegy but perhaps not very surprising as the company is following many of its competitors into the bigleague online trading market Dynegy is following a trail blazed by the likes of EnronOnline Entergy AEP etc in establishing a portal to enhance liquidity improve customer control and create greater trading efficiency Of the various online trading sites that have been announced Dynegydirect appears most similar to EnronOnlineclearly the leader in the fieldbecause it is principalbased In other words Dynegy will be a participant in all of the transactions either as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect will allow customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone during and following the launch of the site Over the last year Dynegy has identified its strategy as wanting to become a leader in the converging energy and communications business In addition according to Dynegys CEO Chuck Watson the companys goal is to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five years by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others Along with a strident strategy of buildin g merchant plants in areas where demand is growing significantly Dynegy presumably plans to now use its trading portal to market the power it has either generated itself or bought on the wholesale market I spoke late yesterday afternoon with Blake Young Dynegys chief informati on officer and president of Dynegy Global Technologies about the new site and how it will compete against such stiff competition First Young said that Dynegydirect is a component of a broader strategy to support Dynegy s comprehensive electronic business efforts What this means is that Dynegydirect ultimately will be much larger than just a trading portal including such other electronic businesses as eprocurement and energy supply chain management The portal will be particularly customerdriven in that it should provide many windows of opportunity for Dynegy customers to maximize their manageme nt capabilities Dynegy has been planning a trading operation for some time its growth as a power generator and marketer has been an indication that Dynegy recognized new trends in the energy industry You may recall that a few months back Dynegy teamed with Williams in investing million each for minority equity stakes in eSpeed Inc As noted in SCIENTECHs IssueAlert from Sept eSpeed is investing million in TradeSpark which plans to create electronic marketplaces for natural gas electricity coal weather derivatives nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission credits TradeSpark is using the infrastructure and capabilities of eSpeed In other words eSpeed is TradeSparks enabler As an investor in eSpeed Dynegy stands to profit from TradeSparks prelaunch market valuation of million At this point it is not clear if Dynegy intends for Dynegydirect to be a competitor to TradeSpark as Dynegy stands to profit from both trading operations How does this all relate to Dynegydirect According to Young Dynegy is pursuing commodity trading along two venues The first is a proprietary onetomany format in which Dynegy will participate in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller This operation will be conducted on the Dynegydirect portal The second venue is an anonymous manytomany format in which Dynegy will participate along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation will take place on TradeSpark which became operational in early October Dynegy is a participating member in TradeSpark along with Coral Energy Dominion Koch Energy Trading TXU Energy Trading Willi ams Energy Marketing and Trading and Cantor Fitzgerald Entergy also plans to come on board as a member and investor once its venture with Koch closes later this year Other key attributes to Dynegydirect as identified in the announcement of the site are that its highly configurable floors will enable customers to group products in a customized fashion for convenient access In additi on customers can trade on multiple floors simultaneously and the sites realtime price updates will allow them to see prices on all of their floors enablin g them to make immediate decisions on prices and volumes Young said that Dynegy is extremely confident that the portals technology will be well accepted as it is JAVAbased meaning among other things that it is flexible enough to operate between MACs and IBMs and objectoriented While these are important from an IT perspective as would be important to CIO Young perhaps more importantly is that the site offers an opportuni ty for Dynegy to support the growth of its businesses and offers a costefficiency tool for customers In August Dynegy announced that it is acquiring Extant a privately held Coloradobased communications solutions and ecommerce company Extants primary line of business is in providing connectivity solutions and broadba nd capacity to communications businesses and information providers enabling them to exchange information and provide voice data and video services to their customers The acquisition will mark Dynegys first significant penetration into the telecommunications sector While not directly related to this new portal the acquisition of Extant is relevant because Dynegy intends to eventually trade broadband capacity on the site Extants broadb and capacity will help to support Dynegys trading of this commodity While the move to online trading is a smart and almost inevitable decisio n for Dynegy and other energy companies wanting to remain competitive the competition and risk associated with this venture are formidable Clearly Dynegy has found a market edge with its eSpeed TradeSpark affiliation TradeSpark is already up and running as compared to many announced trading sites that have launch dates next year In addition TradeSpark is creating a large liquidity pool by bringing together several mediums including the Internet voice brokering and eSpeeds millisecond private global network The manytomany format which Dynegy is pursuing through TradeSpar k is an obvious route for the company to follow and one with considerably less risks associated with it On the other hand building its own Dynegydirect in which Dynegy is the principal player sounds like a Herculean task For perspective Enron was the first company that came out of the gate with an online energy trading portal EnronOnline has a month leadal ong with transactions in excess of billionahead of Dynegy or any comp any that is just now developing a trading portal It appears that Dynegy plans to build Dynegydirect from the ground up unlike its involvement in TradeSpark which is already up and running This could become a lengthy and costly endeavor As I finished writing this analysis Dynegy reported thirdquarter earnings of per share In particular Dynegy reported that recurring net income from Dynegy Marketing and Trading increased to million representing percent of Dynegys consolidated net income compared to million in the third quarter of Obviously Dynegys commodities marketing and trading operation is on a very significant growth mode The launch of Dynegydirectalong with ongoing participation in TradeSparkis a k ey element of this growth DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Online Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass Utilities By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas rates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs ANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heatin g bills that are to percent higher than their bills last winter Domini on East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about more per month for natural gas from November through January And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastwhere low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearbut in the West as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about to an average bill of compar ed to last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in productio n It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand in general has grown to surprising levels Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing opportuni ty and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about per month compared Con Edisons Under its new promotion SmartEnergys plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current naturalgas rates for the next months This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to percent on their energy through the winter months The startup company also is offering United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles credit and signup bonus to entice customers away from Con Edison Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke t prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current rates for months but many others will stick with the company that they know even if their rates increase I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothi ng that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of deregulation In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu lt to beat The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is myHomeKeycom which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use the ir energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only servi ce of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that myHomeKeycom just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check energy efficiency in their homes Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the onlin e providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom Utilitycom has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilityco m plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continue s to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager to grab their own share of the retail market I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital ize on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider s DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Read about SCIENTECHs new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba Chairman and CEO of the

last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE custom ers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure tempor ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it contin ues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

article Australia Jewel in the Crown for Some US Investors at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Oil and NaturalGas Shortages Will They Create a Winter of Discontent By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD US retail energy fuel costs already high by historical standards are expected to remain high this winter due to crude prices that are projected to remain at levels unseen since the Gulf War said the Department of Energ y on Friday In addition households that use natural gas are likely to see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills as well accord ing to the Energy Information Administration EIA The agency said US reside nts can expect heating expenditures to increase by percent for heating oil and propane and percent for natural gas ANALYSIS Despite common belief to the contrary there is a direct correlat ion between the price cycles of oil and natural gas The fact that there are legitimate concerns surrounding the availability of both power sources gives validity to the warnings of price increases this winter When fuel prices are low and naturalgas supplies are abundant there is arguably little connection between the two However the present situation as we head into winter is the exact oppositehigh oil prices and a comprised supply of natural gas leaving the two unquestionably intertwined As energ y users opt to switch from oil to natural gas this affects natural gas suppl y and raises gas prices How did we arrive at this alarming situation which may have been justifiab ly labeled an energy crisis Regarding oil in the worldwide oil indust ry witnessed a decline in oil pricesspawned in part by the economic proble ms in Asiawhich hit a low of less than a barrel in March Oil pro ducers voluntarily initiated decreased production which unsurprisingly started a swift climb in prices in as demand started to increase in a rejuvenated Asia and the United States Together this has created a volatile mix of substantially higher crude oil prices lower inventories and increased demand Even though OPEC has made promises of up to million additional barrels of crude oil per daya result of political pressure put on it by the United States and other countriesit may not be able to force its me mbers to increase production as obviously its in the best interest of oil producers to keep supplies tight and prices high In addition even if they materiali ze these increases promised by OPEC may not be enough to meet growing demand This is alarming as the United States is very reliant on foreign oil which already accounts for about half of US oil use The high price of oil has sent many customers looking for natural gas only to find that it is also in questionable supply Most reports suggest that natural gas heats about percent of all US homes The imbalance between supply and demand found in the oil industry is also found in natura l gas resulting in a projected to percent increase in heating bills this winter Over the last month prices for naturalgas futures have climb ed to record levels of more than per million Btus Yet unlike oil most of the blame placed on low supply for natural gas focuses on the United States rather than other countries A reported percent of federal lands have been placed off limits to naturalgas drillers leaving as many as million acres out of a total of billion available but restricted for naturalgas expansion The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibite d drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground At the same time EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years placing an increasingly high dependence on natural gas even though alternative fuels are not necessarily available to serve as a substitute Given the connection between oil and natural gas any successful attempt to lower oil prices would in turn help to lower naturalgas prices The ability to rely more heavily on oil once again would decrease the need for fuel switching thus reducing the present burden on natural gas Toward this end in late September President Clinton authorized the release of million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR the nations emergency oil stockpile The presidents action caused additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc y supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies Others said the million barrels would do little to ease the problem and that it would take between and million barrels a day for one month to reduce current crude oil prices So what is the solution As noted the issue has become politically polariz ed Within their campaign proposals Gov Bush proposes spending billion to open up US energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources Specifically Bush has proposed among other things opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Range which probably contains about billion barrels of oil Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the United States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell sav e a million barrels of oil a day which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to develop fuel cells alternat ive energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve But what is the answer now as winter fast approaches Unfortunately natur al gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into The degree to which the oilgas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter will depend on the weather The colder the temperature the greater the need for heating power sources which will drive up the cost for both oil and natural gas Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter one that in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past winters which were unusually mild due to La NiFa Already temperatures are dipping to surprising lows across the country Considering that it is only early October warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply will be stretched to meet demand which unquestionably will drive up the price of energy bills Looking forward much of what happens from here will depend on which candid ate is elected in November Most within the energy industry agree that more production is the only answer to supply concerns Yet expanding production will not be an easy task especially in an election year This is not an issue that is gaining high priority within Congress as politicians aim to end their session before the presidential election With such exceedingl y opposed candidates the impact that the imminent election will have on future energy policy cannot be underestimated

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

The presidents action caused additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc y supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies Others said the million barrels would do little to ease the problem and that it would take between and million barrels a day for one month to reduce current crude oil prices So what is the solution As noted the issue has become politically polariz ed Within their campaign proposals Gov Bush proposes spending billion to open up US energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources Specifically Bush has proposed among other things opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Range which probably contains about billion barrels of oil Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the United States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell sav e a million barrels of oil a day which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to develop fuel cells alternat ive energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve But what is the answer now as winter fast approaches Unfortunately natur al gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into The degree to which the oilgas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter will depend on the weather The colder the temperature the greater the need for heating power sources which will drive up the cost for both oil and natural gas Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter one that in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past winters which were unusually mild due to La NiFa Already temperatures are dipping to surprising lows across the country Considering that it is only early October warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply will be stretched to meet demand which unquestionably will drive up the price of energy bills Looking forward much of what happens from here will depend on which candid ate is elected in November Most within the energy industry agree that more production is the only answer to supply concerns Yet expanding production will not be an easy task especially in an election year This is not an issue that is gaining high priority within Congress as politicians aim to end their session before the presidential election With such exceedingl y opposed candidates the impact that the imminent election will have on future energy policy cannot be underestimated

last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE custom ers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure tempor ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it contin ues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

the efforts of energyrelated companies in the evergrowing field of electronic commerce A sample can be viewed at webinfostorensfProductsInfoGrid DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Online Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass Utilities By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas rates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs ANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heatin g bills that are to percent higher than their bills last winter Domini on East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about more per month for natural gas from November through January And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastwhere low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearbut in the West as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about to an average bill of compar ed to last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in productio n It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand in general has grown to surprising levels Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing opportuni ty and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about per month compared Con Edisons Under its new promotion SmartEnergys plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current naturalgas rates for the next months This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to percent on their energy through the winter months The startup company also is offering United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles credit and signup bonus to entice customers away from Con Edison Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke t prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current rates for months but many others will stick with the company that they know even if their rates increase I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothi ng that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of deregulation In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu lt to beat The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is myHomeKeycom which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use the ir energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only servi ce of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that myHomeKeycom just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check energy efficiency in their homes Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the onlin e providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom Utilitycom has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilityco m plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continue s to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager to grab their own share of the retail market I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital ize on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider s DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Read about SCIENTECHs new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba Chairman and CEO of the Public

Winner s and Losers at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy Inc announced the launch of Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree BB portal and trading site for energy and communications commodities Dynegydirect will be introduced to Dynegy customers in a phasedin rollout that started on Oct with online trading commencing over the next sever al weeks Through the portal Dynegy customers will have selfservice access to Dynegys bid and offer prices across US power natural gas and naturalgas liquids products UK power and natural gas as well as coal emission allowances weather derivatives international naturalgas liquids and bandwidth will be offered in the coming months ANALYSIS This is a major undertaking for Dynegy but perhaps not very surprising as the company is following many of its competitors into the bigleague online trading market Dynegy is following a trail blazed by the likes of EnronOnline Entergy AEP etc in establishing a portal to enhance liquidity improve customer control and create greater trading efficiency Of the various online trading sites that have been announced Dynegydirect appears most similar to EnronOnlineclearly the leader in the fieldbecause it is principalbased In other words Dynegy will be a participant in all of the transactions either as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect will allow customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone during and following the launch of the site Over the last year Dynegy has identified its strategy as wanting to become a leader in the converging energy and communications business In addition according to Dynegys CEO Chuck Watson the companys goal is to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five years by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others Along with a strident strategy of buildin g merchant plants in areas where demand is growing significantly Dynegy presumably plans to now use its trading portal to market the power it has either generated itself or bought on the wholesale market I spoke late yesterday afternoon with Blake Young Dynegys chief informati on officer and president of Dynegy Global Technologies about the new site and how it will compete against such stiff competition First Young said that Dynegydirect is a component of a broader strategy to support Dynegy s comprehensive electronic business efforts What this means is that Dynegydirect ultimately will be much larger than just a trading portal including such other electronic businesses as eprocurement and energy supply chain management The portal will be particularly customerdriven in that it should provide many windows of opportunity for Dynegy customers to maximize their manageme nt capabilities Dynegy has been planning a trading operation for some time its growth as a power generator and marketer has been an indication that Dynegy recognized new trends in the energy industry You may recall that a few months back Dynegy teamed with Williams in investing million each for minority equity stakes in eSpeed Inc As noted in SCIENTECHs IssueAlert from Sept eSpeed is investing million in TradeSpark which plans to create electronic marketplaces for natural gas electricity coal weather derivatives nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission credits TradeSpark is using the infrastructure and capabilities of eSpeed In other words eSpeed is TradeSparks enabler As an investor in eSpeed Dynegy stands to profit from TradeSparks prelaunch market valuation of million At this point it is not clear if Dynegy intends for Dynegydirect to be a competitor to TradeSpark as Dynegy stands to profit from both trading operations How does this all relate to Dynegydirect According to Young Dynegy is pursuing commodity trading along two venues The first is a proprietary onetomany format in which Dynegy will participate in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller This operation will be conducted on the Dynegydirect portal The second venue is an anonymous manytomany format in which Dynegy will participate along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation will take place on TradeSpark which became operational in early October Dynegy is a participating member in TradeSpark along with Coral Energy Dominion Koch Energy Trading TXU Energy Trading Willi ams Energy Marketing and Trading and Cantor Fitzgerald Entergy also plans to come on board as a member and investor once its venture with Koch closes later this year Other key attributes to Dynegydirect as identified in the announcement of the site are that its highly configurable floors will enable customers to group products in a customized fashion for convenient access In additi on customers can trade on multiple floors simultaneously and the sites realtime price updates will allow them to see prices on all of their floors enablin g them to make immediate decisions on prices and volumes Young said that Dynegy is extremely confident that the portals technology will be well accepted as it is JAVAbased meaning among other things that it is flexible enough to operate between MACs and IBMs and objectoriented While these are important from an IT perspective as would be important to CIO Young perhaps more importantly is that the site offers an opportuni ty for Dynegy to support the growth of its businesses and offers a costefficiency tool for customers In August Dynegy announced that it is acquiring Extant a privately held Coloradobased communications solutions and ecommerce company Extants primary line of business is in providing connectivity solutions and broadba nd capacity to communications businesses and information providers enabling them to exchange information and provide voice data and video services to their customers The acquisition will mark Dynegys first significant penetration into the telecommunications sector While not directly related to this new portal the acquisition of Extant is relevant because Dynegy intends to eventually trade broadband capacity on the site Extants broadb and capacity will help to support Dynegys trading of this commodity While the move to online trading is a smart and almost inevitable decisio n for Dynegy and other energy companies wanting to remain competitive the competition and risk associated with this venture are formidable Clearly Dynegy has found a market edge with its eSpeed TradeSpark affiliation TradeSpark is already up and running as compared to many announced trading sites that have launch dates next year In addition TradeSpark is creating a large liquidity pool by bringing together several mediums including the Internet voice brokering and eSpeeds millisecond private global network The manytomany format which Dynegy is pursuing through TradeSpar k is an obvious route for the company to follow and one with considerably less risks associated with it On the other hand building its own Dynegydirect in which Dynegy is the principal player sounds like a Herculean task For perspective Enron was the first company that came out of the gate with an online energy trading portal EnronOnline has a month leadal ong with transactions in excess of billionahead of Dynegy or any comp any that is just now developing a trading portal It appears that Dynegy plans to build Dynegydirect from the ground up unlike its involvement in TradeSpark which is already up and running This could become a lengthy and costly endeavor As I finished writing this analysis Dynegy reported thirdquarter earnings of per share In particular Dynegy reported that recurring net income from Dynegy Marketing and Trading increased to million representing percent of Dynegys consolidated net income compared to million in the third quarter of Obviously Dynegys commodities marketing and trading operation is on a very significant growth mode The launch of Dynegydirectalong with ongoing participation in TradeSparkis a k ey element of this growth DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

<3822183.1075846314796.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-18 03:56:00,Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government A new SCIENTECH PowerHitter interview with E Linn Draper Chairman President and CEO of American Electric Power is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Department of Energy will have more than million for fuel cell related programs in the new fiscal year million above the presidents request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed upon million for stationary fuel cells million more than request ed and approved the full request of million for transportation fuel cell research and million for buildings ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than expect ed should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel cells Although generally considered the favorite of low zero emission energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently availab le in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since batteries were discovered years ago but the high cost of producing them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest million in Energy Conversion Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals significant support from the federal government In addition warnings about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as oppose d to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without burni ng producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need recharg ing although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero pollution are very appealing Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of generation available for widespread use by or Under the DOE grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In addition the funding allocates million to transportation fuel cell research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile application s The million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy pe fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator for buildings and other research and development Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As custom ers possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional busine ss of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have drama tic financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabam a Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity at a reported efficiency of about percent compared with percent for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system of MercedesBenz Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about million in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the partnership Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke ts for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through distribu ted generation products such as fuel cells These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential for the automotive fuel cell market at billion annually by and as high as billion cumulative for the stationary power markets withi n years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just within the last month that they will

IssueAlert October Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Discover a world of utilities information in our new ezine SourceBook Online

<24898367.1075846318333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-30 03:22:00,SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December LADWP Continues to Shine Despite Californias Dark Period By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one o f New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts t o support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO which has run the states wholesale power market since The NYSEG report titled New York States Electr ic Energy Crisis and NYSEGs Comprehensive Solution criticizes the NYISO fo r not giving power consumers price certainty in the transition from local monopolies to an open competitive market Analysis New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener gy markets as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou t an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season However unlike California which basically faces a power supply problem th at can be improved over time New York arguably suffers from a more severe and permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved Like its West Coast counterpart New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance a nd local resistance that thwarts new generation development However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin ue to take their own toll on the stability of the market Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o n each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe r As noted in its new report NYSEG a subsidiary of Energy East NYSE EAS is especially critical of NYISO which it says has contributed to soaring wholesale prices in New York NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining unrealistic goals for new power supply not providing accurate price signal s to energy customers and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems Yet beyond the finger pointing some essential facts can be established o n which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree According to data included in the NYISO report between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state increased only by MW New York has not brought a new plant online sin ce when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven year s since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate In addition New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks Deficie nt transmission systems in central New York around New York City and at the outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than can be imported into the state New York City is relatively isolated from t he transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o n citybased power supply New York Citys load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incity capacity along with imports t o meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall These projections presume normal weather conditions If New York experiences a warmerthannormal summer th e outlook gets even worse Further according to a report from New Yorks State Attorney General between and capital improvements to New Yorks transmission syste m dropped from million per year to million per year At the presen t time only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is scheduled A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut would provide Long Island with about MW of additional power and increas e its import capacity by about percent Unless this transmission expansion is expedited it is not scheduled for operation until Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York most certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th e use of air conditioners pushing demand to annual highs While NYSEG and th e NYISO may agree on the nature of New Yorks problems a contentious debate has emerged with regard to finding a solution In its own proposal release d in early March the NYISO focused on building new generation expediting siting processes improving transmission lines and conservation efforts I n one of its key proposals the NYISO urged the creation of MW of new electricity roughly percent of New Yorks peak demand by with up to MW of that generation being made available by the end of NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for falling short in its assessment o f the magnitude of the crisis and issued its own proposals in its recent report For instance NYSEG officials said that NYISO had grossly oversimplified the situation and that considering the tenuous state of power construction in New York the objective of establishing MW by was extremely unrealistic In turn NYSEG says that a robust wholesa le electric market will not materialize in New York until assuming that measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately In earl y March NYSEG released the NYSEGPlan outlining six steps which it believe s contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition to a competitive market in New York In summary the NYSEGPlan includes Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants Adding to the states transmission capacity Adding to the states naturalgas supply infrastructure Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers by encouraging interruptible load where feasible and building the technological infrastructure necessary for realtime pricing Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan in which electric rates would be frozen for seven years by July However while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals the same obstacles inherent in New Yorks market might also thwart its own ener gy plan For instance topping the list of NYSEGs six steps is an emphasis on establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and approval process This may be easier said than done As I mentioned in my IssueAlert the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th e lobbying force that community groups in California wield In that column I discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in Ramapo NY from an MW combinedcycle facility to a MW peaking unit due to opposition raised by local residents In addition just yesterday a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort s by the New York Power Authority NYPA to build two MW gasfired generators in the borough of Queens The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to cease all construction on the units and ruled that the power authority violated state environmentalreview laws to its efforts to rush the plant into service by June In response NYPA has said that the plantsalong w ith nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York Cityare need ed to prevent power outages this summer NYPA continues to face fierce opposition from community groups many of them launching lawsuits who do not want the generation units in their neighborhoods Consequently the supply demand imbalance in New York is a very serious matter and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless blackouts occur Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines surrounding New York State and New York City are solved adding new power supply assuming that generation development can move past community opposition would not be enough to bring more balance to the market In the interim conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c an user to abate power outages this summer but again the general public may n ot fully understand the need to reduce their power usage New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for nearterm problems First expedite the building of new generation sources including distribution generation alternatives This assumes that gas lines will be sufficient to import necessary fuel Second allow the economy of New York City to stagnate as a result of the supply demand imbalance which will drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand And third focu s on conservation efforts which again may not work until residents are directly impacted by outages The city may choose a combination of all thre e approaches or decide to focus on just one However to address the immediat e concerns it does not appear that New York has any options besides this threetier approach One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne w York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture Although it is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated divestiture utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur e to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most of their power plants NYSEG the author of the new report on New Yorks power problems is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will remain only in the transmission business This most likely creates a heightened sensitivity on NYSEGs part with regard to the power supply shortages presently facing New York Again we now have two states that represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility model becomes dismantled Of course it is not fair to say that divestiture is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York but taking away a utilitys ability to effectively control is own power supply costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only

little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only

rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV or Compa nia Anomima Nacional Telefonos facing a billion hostile takeover bid by AES Corp NYSE AES has forced a showdown with the USbased global power company by announcing a share repurchase program The Board of Direct ors of CANTV Venezuelas biggest telecommunications company recommended t hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to perce nt of CANTVs shares at a price of per American Depositary Share ADS or approximately per share Analysts said the CANTV Boards proposal s which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set for Oct clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES Analysis AES expansion in Latin Americas telecommunications market was a lways seen as a risky move and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi g bite out of the companys strategy CANTV which was an appealing takeove r target for AES due to its longstanding monopoly over the telecom market in Venezuela has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications NYSE VZ which holds a percent stake in the company Verizon came out in support of the percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV whic h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES efforts to gain c ontrol over the company The repurchase could be seen as a power play with Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV which many analysts m ight see as a more appropriate synergy However this story also highlights the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ a especially since CANTVs resistance comes on the heels of AES pulling o ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador For background it is important to note that AES already owns percent o f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas Venezuel as largest private electricity company Thus the takeover effort is an at tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from Verizon CANTV which was privatized a decade ago is a fullservice teleco mmunications provider offering switched and local domestic and internation al longdistance service throughout Venezuela Company CANTV also offers mo bile cellular services wireless services Internet access and other value added services and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nationa l network of public telephone lines CANTV became privatized about years ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixedline teleph one service in Venezuela The company has a market capitalization of b illion AES had bid in cash for each of the million USlisted shares in CANTV and in cash for each of the million shares of CANTV traded in Venezuela AES offer for CANTVs American shares represents a perc ent premium over CANTVs closing price of on Aug the time at wh ich the takeover effort was launched From the start of the offer some cri tics charged that this bid was too low but AES has maintained that the off er is fair AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTVs mobile services which account for about a quarter of the companys revenues and distribute the proceeds to shareholders CANTV was never very receptive to AES bid and did consider it to be a hos tile takeover In fact workers representatives at CANTV circulated a stat ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES stating that the deal would s everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers CANTV employees hold a per cent interest in the company Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock Note that CANTV wil l most likely issue the buyback program at compared to the that AE S had offered Thus the challenge for AES if it still wants to gain contr ol over CANTV will be to increase its already percent premium offer T he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi th its takeover attempt and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem pts AES rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw ofold in nature First AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil Chile and other countries Just this week AES announced its penetration of the A rgentina market by inking a million deal to purchase distribution and generation assets in that country from New Jerseybased Public Service Ente rprise Group PSEG In another recent announcement AES launched a cash te nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile a company that c onsists of MW of generation and kilometers of transmission In fa ct AES reportedly rivals Spains Endesa as the regions most dominant powe r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t hroughout Latin America Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni ted States Asia Europe and Latin America many investors now perceive th e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America which constitute s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou s Latin American countries However AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a million ta keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor Currently Edelnor which is one of the largest electrical generators in Chile is controlled by Mirant Corp one of AES direct competitors in the independent power producing market Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region Mirant has announc ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles s it can be assured of repayment AES did not give a reason for its decisio n to terminate the Edelnor takeover but one can surmise that investor reac tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor Further on Sept AES cut its earnings estimate for to a range of to per share from a previous range of to AES blam ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and US dollar lower UK power prices and the companys inability to replace earnings a nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant The drop in AES earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp any needed to purchase Edelnor AES shares were priced at prior to the earnings revision After the announcement at least as of early morning trading on Sept AES shares were priced at significantly down from the week high of whi ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago As of early morning trading on Oct AES shares were priced at Moreover investors did not react positively to AES plan to increase its s take in CANTV In fact after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug a day on which many stocks fell AES stock closed down or pe rcent to a month low of on the New York Stock Exchange AES CEO Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase did not represent a change of strategy for AES which he says will remain f ocused on power In addition Bakke noted that the purchase does not repres ent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Br azil and Bolivia Further Bakke clearly stated that AES is not going to a nnounce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world Nevertheless so me investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sec tor which is already significantly troubled and becoming too heavily entr enched in Latin America a market that is prone to political volatility On e investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date has not been terribly successful This coupled with the general market dow nturn for most companies with telecom exposure does not make for a good re cipe from an investors perspective at least as of today In fairness to AES penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver y strategic move from a longterm perspective With a population of mi llion Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r elated services In addition Venezuela is an assetrich country particula rly with regard to oil resources According to the Department of Energy Ve nezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil re serves of billion barrels plus billions of barrels of extraheavy oil a nd bitumen Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of US o il imports and is among the top crude oil producers in the world In add ition as noted AES investments in Latin America are not exclusively focus ed on Venezuela as the company also is present in Argentina Brazil Chile etc Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Lati n America and play a larger role in the drop in AES stock especially when we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time Only little more than a year ago the telecom sector was at its peak with bill ions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic ex pectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market Howeve r a massive downturn has ensued impacting not only companies operating in the telecom space but the nations entire economy as well The bottom of t he telecom sector has fallen out due in large part to the fact that the in crease in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand As Ive said before when analyzing this company the further that AES depar ts from its core strategy the more likely it is that we will continue to s ee volatility in the companys stock Up until these recent announcements AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses which were all equally important to its strategy power generation network delivery services and retail energy marketing Generation always appeared to be the main core of the companys business model as AES controls some facilit ies totaling over gigawatts of capacity worldwide This business model w orked well for AES and was well received by investors Any perceived deviat ion from this successful strategyespecially if it includes expansion into the dangerous territory of telecomcould mark a new and risky era for AES Nevertheless one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunit y that is worth exploring Latin America has low electrification and Intern et usage statistics Some analysts project high growth in the next to years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use which in t urn involves telecommunications The telecom industry is struggling at the moment Thus if one believes that telecom will make a comeback then buyin g now may make a wise strategy for those involved An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We

Rules May Set Continental Standard By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters USowned EntergyKoch Trading NYSE EKT is boo sting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands After a successful start we plan to subst antially increase our volume of European power power options and weather t rading next year said Uday Narang managing director of European trading EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in Fr ance and Austria although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Net herlands Analysis The announcement from EntergyKoch Trading that it will significa ntly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique In fact a recent scan of announcements from US power firms tells a similar story Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to stren gthen its European operations in an effort to replicate its strong US e nergy trading platform in Europe TXU said that it expects sharply higher profits this year from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent For the first nine months of TXU reportedly traded terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in con tinental Europe mostly in Germany which compared to terawatt hours in all of Further still UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity the fourthlarg est regional electric utility in the United Kingdom which in addition to miles of electric distribution lines owns a MW power plant The unrelated announcements have a common denominator US power firms are pl unging into the European energy trading market in droves despite some inhe rent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric compe tition among some European countries A new model in the United Kingdom kn own as the new energy trading agreement NETA rules appear to be facilita ting more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard acr oss the Continent The appeal of Europes power market for US energy companies is perhaps ob vious According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year de mand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to b e built an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT i n Texas In addition like other developed areas of the world Europes en ergy consumption has grown over the last two years US power firms who p erhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country have expanded operations in Europe where electric privatization i s occurring on a countrybycountry basis Consequently the companies ment ioned above join Williams Enron Duke AEP and Mirant to name a few wh ich have established London trading offices Moreover many of the US power firms that expand into Europe start by acc umulating generation assets in the United Kingdom as represented by the Ut iliCorp and Dynegy announcements Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early s and completed the process in May after Norway but well ahead of ot her European countries However there is a more important reason why US energy firms may be drawn to UK power trading and that is related to th e areas unique rules for energy transactions which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules it is important to fi rst understand the context of the European market as a whole and the tradin g system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this ye ar The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition Toward this end the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches allowing endusers the right to select an alternative provi der giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power sup pliers transmission and distribution network otherwise known as thirdpar ty access and the introduction of energy trading which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market This last point is significant because some of the European countries have dismantled previo usly integrated stateowned utilities and mandated the divestiture of gene ration assets At the end of approximately percent of the European Union EU e lectricity market was open to competition Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries at least those that a re open That is the good news However the basic problem with this appro ach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the t ransition to a fully competitive marketplace and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables For instance Germany is fully privatized while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide thirdpa rty access to competitors In practice this often means that one country m ay have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neig hboring country may have not developed any standards at all The other prob lem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient which makes it difficult to transport power across borders As a result wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneo us and lacking in comprehensive trading standards The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for thirdparty acce ss to the national grids on the Continent While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved the U nited Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more ef ficient market because it offers one grid system one balancing and settlem ent code and one contract format However even the power trading market i n the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start Up until March of th is year the UK power market operated under a pool auction system Unde r that model generation companies offered electricity for sale which was then pooled into an auction system where dayahead bids were made and power was sold in halfhour increments The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive marke t for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight However the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for m arket manipulation Given the concerns with the pool format the United Kin gdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October which culminated in the NETA model that started this year The key tenets that ma ke NETA different from the previous pool model are Forwards and futures markets which allow participants to form power sale d eals using standardized contracts either ontheday or several years in adv ance as opposed to only dayahead bids More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers c an negotiate bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the Unite d Kingdom A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co operating in a role similar to an ISO which facilitates the var ious transactions to ensure reliability The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand rep resented by individual meters and the threat of strict penalties for part icipants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity In a nutshell NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power tradi ng in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming The system i mprovements have been successful and more international power firms appare ntly believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kin gdom due to the NETA rules Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a percent increase in the number of contracts traded a perce nt drop in wholesale prices and a sixfold increase in the variety of produ cts offered As of early summer about new participants had regist ered to participate under the NETA system as compared with about under the former model As noted many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the C ontinent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale m arkets to competition In addition to the UKs model there are several a ctive trading exchanges in Europe presently although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive The Nord Pool with about members organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures market s The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about members and operates a s pot market for electrical power Smaller European exchanges offering both spot and futures contracts include the Switzerland Exchange and Germanys Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt In the meantime I think we will conti nue to see additional US power firms expanding into the European trading market and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert

Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC signed off on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevadas Yucca Mountain to hold radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants Yet another step in a lon g approval process the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by the Department of Energy DOE The Bush administration must still submit t hat plan for congressional approval The DOE in August gave a favorable saf ety assessment to the proposed project which may face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen Harry Reid of Nevada the new Senate assistant majority leader Analysis This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the na tions repository for spent nuclear fuel but the NRC approval of the site could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress Since Sept new secur ity issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washi ngton DC pause and support ongoing efforts to block the site Neverthel ess after a decade of study planning commissions and public debate the N RC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will side on the issue For background since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted be lief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioact ive materials is to store them deep underground From this starting point the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in and charged t he DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials coul d be stored From the beginning it was understood that the NRC would need to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional approval would also be necessary In the DOE selected nine locations in six states for consideration as possible depositories and at that time President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive s cientific study known as site characterization The three locations were Hanford Wash Deaf Smith County Texas and Yucca Mountain Nev In Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to onl y study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location based on the finding from th e earlier report In other words since that time no other location besides Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nucl ear waste in the United States The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear e nergy and weapons has become increasingly limited The Bush administration s national energy plan released last April demonstrated strong support fo r the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources Thus the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considera bly in the near future and the location of an acceptable repository has be come a top priority for the federal government What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location According to the vast amo unt of research compiled over the last decade there are several characteri stics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository sit e it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population miles from Las Vegas it is located in a very dry climate with less than six inches of water per year and the location offers an extremely deep w ater table to feet below the level of the potential repository In addition Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air Force Range and the Nevada Test Site where atomicbomb tests once took pl ace Thus it is considered a very secure area Based on these characterist ics over the last years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioact ive waste Under the evolving plan the site reportedly would store underground thousa nds of tons of radioactive materials from the nations nuclear plants for a n estimated years Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be use d as the repository by but a delay in feasibility studies caused that date to be extended several times It is presently expected that assuming the site gains all the necessary approvals Yucca Mountain would be used a s a repository starting in However while scientists may have been generally in agreement reaching co nsensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult From a fe deral perspective President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository This belief has been sh ared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham However Nevada state leaders hav e demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the s torage of nuclear waste which has caused state federal conflicts for the last several years Specifically Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn and the Nevada A ttorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to usi ng Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire is sue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely considering the recent national events Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials In fact the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to is sue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate Nevada had gra nted water rights to the federal government but only for the study purpose s and not the actual use of the site The issue is still working itself thr ough various courts The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federa l court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized under federal law Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently out lined their concerns in public meetings Basically the top concern is that the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and in to the aboveground environment Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a fault line which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the po tential repository could be subject to shifting The location of Yucca Moun tain while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan has also bee n used by opponents as an argument against the plan Specifically opponent s say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor locate d about miles away and that a large number of military flights routine ly cross over the site In addition the events of Sept certainly have heightened concerns abou t potential targets for terrorist activity and despite reassurances from s cientists that the site is secure opponents believe that no site would be attackproof Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountai n The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsib le for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site because the transportation would be handled by private companies Critics of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the cou ntry The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the pre viously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca Mountain site All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will s ide with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and after n early two decades of study the pros of using this site outweigh the potent ial risks Regardless of the ultimate decision action on nuclear waste is necessary The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States However if we take the range of estima tes it would equate to a football field ranging from to feet deep T hat estimate takes into account all highlevel nuclear waste generated in t he United States since the start of a nuclear program in the s Compare d to other hazardous materials the amount of nuclear waste generated per y ear is very small In the United States all of the nuclear plants produce about tons of spent fuel a year whereas million tons of chemica l waste are generated per year

oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to launc h its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Like wise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies En ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional genera ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint own erships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged i nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lead ership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic kly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten in to the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu cing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies

Causes New State Federal Conflicts By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The federal government has reached a deal with a c oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo rnia under a million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state Construction on the socalled Path project which was announced by Ener gy Secretary Spencer Abraham will begin in the spring of and could be completed by as early as summer Analysis The California energy crisis which clearly subsided over the sum mer of due to new generation that came online in the state mild weath er patterns and conservation efforts is generally considered the result of a severe supply demand imbalance While this may be true what often get s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the statethe lines that actually transport power from point A to point Balso played a primar y role in creating the tremendous instability of Californias energy market This problem still persists today and as California heads into the winte r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing The Dep artment of Energy DOE has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to Californias main transmission line While this is a positive step the upgrade creates a new level of state federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th e hands of private companies which creates a whole new set of potential co nflicts Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path upgrade there a re some things that we know for sure First Path which is owned by Pac ific Gas Electric Co is a mile highvoltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif ornia During the peak of the energy crisis in California Path became r ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks points at which transmission c ould not transport high volumes of power This preempted any transport of power from Southern California and Arizona and Mexico to the north whic h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor nia cities As noted these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand which is obviously a concern as w inter approaches The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat es energy market Ironically power supply is no longer seen as an imminen t problem New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou ld have operating reserves of between and MW this winter which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season However the report on the states transmission system is n ot as positive If the Northwest continues to experience a drought then No rthern California will still need to import more power from the south Heav y dependence on the strained Path could once again cause reliability pro blems for California Thus deficiencies along Path can be seen as a symptom of larger problem s that continue to plague California and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months if not years In fact there is a history here that is worth noting especially as it relates to f ederal state jurisdiction When President Bush released his national ener gy plan in April of this year he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path Following through with this order Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo nses from companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path The current contract which will add a new line to the existing Path is the result of that previous directive At present it appears that PGE Corp NYSE PCG the parent of Pacific G as Electric Co and six other companies have signed on to financially su pport the upgrade The six other companies that will spearhead the project are the Transmission Agency of Northern California TransElect Inc Kind er Morgan Power Co PGE National Energy Group Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA a federal ag ency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in wester n states and operates miles of transmission lines Presently Path connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t he states largest generation facilitiesPacific Gas Electric Cos Diabl o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energys Morro Bay naturalgas power pla nt The upgrade will reportedly include a new kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about MW from these two plants Further when t he upgrade is finished in Path should be able to carry a total of MW of power Of course the first question that I asked was Who is going to pay for the upgrade The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line The rema ining percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade The exact percentages of i nvestment and ownership have yet to be defined but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next days You may ask why these comp anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California Th e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr ough fees charged to use the new transmission line This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project who presumably ant icipate that California will remain a highdemand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported As I mentioned there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th is upgrade plan First there is the issue of potential state federal reg ulatory conflicts Presently state governments have jurisdiction over powe r line siting Thus the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path prior to Secretary A brahams call for privatecompany bids Specifically the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas Electric Co which it regulates to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path As seems to be a growing occurrence we may find that there is a state federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali fornia Gov Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t he states prerogative and have issued strong criticisms over the DOEs ve nture into this territory However in his energy plan President Bush seem ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca pacity If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE it is no t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area In any event representatives from TransElect one of the participating companie s have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state and public and private interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project Note that TransElect was the company that had unsuccessf ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California E dison earlier this year Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOEs upgrade plan for Path are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of Californias transmission grid The DOEsponsored upgrade u nlike the one that the CPUC has directed reportedly would not be subject t o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC Further bec ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n ew line these companies will be able to charge tolls to the power market ers that use the lines to transport power This is most likely a point of c ontention for California officials especially Gov Gray Davis who has sou ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p rivatecompany ownership of generation facilities in the state The positiv e side of this issue is that according to the DOE the bids from private c ontracts enable the upgrade of Path to proceed without any increase to either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am erica As a side note in addition to Path the CPUC is also proceeding with a n ew transmission line in Southern California known as the ValleyRainbow In terconnect transmission line Although the timetable has been delayed until San Diego Gas Electric is proceeding with a volt transmiss ion line that would connect Southern California Edisons Valley Substation near Romoland Calif with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo w Calif area just south of the RiversideSan Diego county line The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDGEs an d SCEs transmission systems The first interconnection is at the San Onofr e Substation near San Clemente Calif The project is designed to deliver a pproximately MW Moreover the expansion of Path is a necessary step to help California l ower its risk for further reliability problems Due to generation developme nt the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors The state government still has its hand in power purchases which represe nts a huge part of the states energy market The state has accrued b illion in debt to buy power for the states utilities the recovery for whi ch remains an unresolved issue While Gov Davis has preferred to increase the states role in Californias energy infrastructure this new DOEsponso red project on Path puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies An

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from PR Newswire Conectiv NYSE CIV an energy provider locat ed in the MidAtlantic announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Atlanti c City Electric Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in t hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company The ownership interests were sold for approximately million excluding re imbursement of estimated fuel inventory subject to adjustment Analysis This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week but I di d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development The transfer of ownershi p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b ecause of its relation to Conectivs unique competitive strategy and the ro undrobin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat es Further despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation s nuclear facilities we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectivs owne rship in the plants which Conectiv shares with other companies who also h appen to be the buying partners in this sale The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows A percent interest MW in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U nits and sold in equal shares to coowners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon Pri or to the transaction PSEG Nuclear an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi ce Enterprise Group Incorporated and Exelon each owned about percent of the Peach Bottom plant Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit y A percent interest MW in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un its and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which prior to the sale owned about percent of the facility PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla nt A percent interest MW in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U nits and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which is the operator of the plant a nd prior to the sale owned percent of the facility As noted the significance of these transactions relates to Conectivs comp etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector Lets look at Conectiv first According to Conectivs President and COO Thomas Shaw the divestiture of t he nuclear assets is consistent with the companys focused business strateg y on two core energy businesses Conectiv Energy the companys integrated generation and asset optimization group and Conectiv Power Delivery the c ompanys regulated delivery business To support this twotiered focus Con ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t o expand a generation portfolio that includes only midmerit plants units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns Midmerit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant s and peaker units Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent a midmerit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent to percent From Conectivs perspective the value of the midmerit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op erate only when demand is comparatively high Further the company believes that midmerit units are ideally suited to support the companys energy tr ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of MW of bas eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power Light a subsidiary of Conect iv to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectivs telecommunications busi ness Conectiv Communications to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond Va for million In addition Conectiv sold its percent stake in a MW co generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP a nonut ility electric generator for million Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own ership of some MW of midmerit generation in the MidAtlantic region The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r epay debt and fund Conectivs development of additional midmerit assets C onectivs immediate goal is to build more than MW of midmerit power generation within the MidAtlantic region by Toward that end Conecti v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon ey to support a million MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S tation which is currently a MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur al gas The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge neration supports Conectivs strategy of refocusing on its core businesses which are power trading and wholesale marketing through midmerit units only and a regulated delivery business Conectiv Power Delivery provides e nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey Delaware M aryland and Virginia Given the fairly distinct line between Conectivs re gulated and unregulated businesses I have previously speculated that Conec tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand alone company a trend represented by AEP Reliant and UtiliCorp Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring so it is unlikely that any such sp in off of its generation business would take place in the near term Howeve r as far as I know Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e xclusively on midmerit plants Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco a partnership t hat is scheduled to close in April In this deal Pepco is acquiring C onectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at billion Both co mpanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date The partnership between these two relatively small and regional ly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity d elivery company in the MidAtlantic region By combining their two electric ity delivery businesses Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doubl e their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times In the nuclear sector it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con ectiv despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj ority ownership in the plants Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclearpower space and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li cense exchange on these three plants Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind ustry owning a total of reactors Earlier this year Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years and did not rule out the fact that his company migh t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility As noted PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente rprise Group Inc which in was split into PSEG a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power an unregulated US power generation company As noted PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek NJ and oversees PSEG Powers ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station located in Delta Pa When the Conectiv transaction is completed PSEG Power will own percent of Hope Creek percent of Salem and percent of Peach Bottom In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear Entergy Corp is another company th at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector Since Enter gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block Recently Entergy bought Con Edisons Indian Point Unit s and nuclear power plants in Westchester County NY In addition Ent ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat ion to purchase the MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon Vt for million With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale Enterg y will own a nuclear fleet that includes reactors Also note that the Ne w York State Public Service Commission PSC just approved the sale of Niag ara Mohawks Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about million The purchase prices for the MW Nine Mile and percent of the MW Nine Mile are about million and mill ion respectively Constellation is another company that has consistently i ncreased its nuclear power assets Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate d with coalfired generation many industry analysts have debated whether o r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence Exelon for example is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR Supporters of PBMR believe its relatively small size MW anticipated short construction time months and cost kW can once again make nuclear power an acceptable option In February of Exelon filed an application with th e US nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United States

split the company into two parts and severing it s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs NYSEGS which would have been a minority partner in its energytrading operation if the spinoff had gone ahead Analysis Constellation Energys stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven yearsdown nearly percent in one day and down over percent si nce May But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts E arlier in the week Allegheny Energy NYSEAYE announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering IPO of Allegheny Energy Supply Com pany its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary until market conditions improve The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for ces Constellation sited falling energy prices the changing nature of the California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo r dropping its companyseparation plans The company said it would now focu s on using its single status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S tates What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co mes from being a single company What has changed in the last one year i s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants the reasons are simple and profound The world has changed Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference call with the media The change in Constellations strategy will be costly The company will pay Goldman Sachs about million to terminate their powermarketing agreem ent million which Goldman had previously put in the business and million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti nued Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau se the company to record a million special expense in the fourth quart er The company said that its splitup with Goldman Sachs was amicable Gol dmans relationship with Constellation started in the midnineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business In Goldman agreed it would take a percent stake in Constellations trading business when the state of Maryl and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa rate trading company Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth er It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other significant announcements concerning its future plans Mayo A Shattuck II I was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban c Alex Brown

Allegheny is confi dent that its yearend earnings will be within its guidance range of to per share Despite the strong earnings Alleghenys stock price has dropped over pe rcent since May and over percent in the past trading days The drop i n energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric es Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny s earnings by cents to citing reduced forward power price a ssumptions The highflying days of the recent past where energy companies pricetoe arnings PE multiples were exceeding in certain cases appear to be ov er Many power producers are returning to their rootsscrapping plans for s plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften ing wholesale market prices Paul Patterson an energy analyst with ABN Amr o said there are common themes affecting the industry One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them And two is lower sto ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth AES Corp NYSEAES apparently agrees Its earnings fell for a second co nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s elling off assets AES Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable longterm c ontract generation business By placing generating capacity into longterm contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla t growth Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were very low allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p roduct But with the slowing economy mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices power demand for is flat or even down from one yea r ago in many parts of the country The recent actions of Constellation Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu ndamental shift in the electric business Their actions are in some respec ts a return to the pastcompanies striving for predictability and reliabil ity in their power supply costs profits and operations Perhaps most signi ficantly companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w hether or not they will continue to be an

Transformation Into Touch America By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from CBS MarketWatch Montana Power shares fell on Nov a da y after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter citing the slowdow n in the economy and the companys transition from a diversified energy com pany to a standalone telecommunications firm The stock fell to a week low of earlier in the session It closed Nov at down ce nts As of early morning trading on Nov Montana Power shares remained at Analysis There is little doubt that Montana Power currently finds itself a t a challenging crossroads The company remains in the midst of becoming so lely a telecommunications operation having sold off much of its utility ho ldings However the process has hit several snags including an incomplete transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to Northwestern Corp C ompounding Montana Powers current problems is a weakened financial perform ance which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the telecom business In addition the company faces a host of related challen ges including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for t he asset sale to Northwestern requests for rate increases to fund the purc hase of power that Montana Power must buy on the wholesale market and insp ection of the longterm powerpurchase contracts that the company has forme d with various suppliers The question that investors should be asking with regard to Montana Powers current plight is whether or not the financial l osses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or so me larger indication of doubt about the companys viability as a telecom op eration For its third quarter Montana Power posted a loss of million o r cents a share representing a million swing from its Q pro fit of million or cents a share During the third quarter of Montana Power had reported a net income of million Montana Power h as noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to Touch America but also included a million pretax writedown of inve stments in two other telecommunications companies One had filed for bankru ptcy and the other defaulted on loans that Montana Power had helped guarant ee In addition company officials have attributed the loss to price decrea ses and the slowing economy However note that the current thirdquarter l osses followed losses in the second quarter as well Specifically the comp any reported a net loss of million or cents a share in the Q compared with net income of million or cents a share in the second quarter of The company also previously reduced its expectation s of revenue growth in to percent from percent According to Mon tana Powers CEO Bob Gannon the company is merely experiencing a shortte rm liquidity problem Nevertheless to say that Montana Power is having some growing pains is an understatement Since March it has been Montana Powers goal to total ly divest all of its energy assets and reemerge as a debtfree communicati ons company operating under the name of Touch America presently the compa nys telecom subsidiary with zero debt million in cash and m iles of fiber communications lines CEO Gannon originally envisioned and c ontinues to see Touch America as one of the largest broadband companies in the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrat ed Montana Power Much of the transition has already taken place consideri ng that Montana Power has successfully divested its oil and gas coal and i ndependent power production businesses As noted the last piece of the puz zle is the sale of its electric and naturalgas utility operations to North western Corp a provider of electricity naturalgas and communications se rvices to Midwestern customers This is a big piece of the puzzle however as Touch America is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to sup port continued growth Therein lies one of the main challenges for Montana Power The Montana Publ ic Service Commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve t he sale of these assets Some analysts have suggested that Montana Powers financial problems can be resolved only if the Montana Public Service Commi ssion approves the sale of the electric and naturalgas distribution system s which could inject some million in Touch Americas operations Yet state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsels office wh ich represents ratepayers in utility cases and a group of large industrial electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed sale of the assets The less time provided for equalopportunity review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be cha llenged down the line After some early deliberation the Montana Public Service Commission has no w agreed to review the billion proposed sale of the assets to Northwes tern Corp by Jan although lawyers for Montana Power are still l obbying to have this review moved up to December Part of the pressure for the review the companys attorneys have argued is that if the sale is not approved by the end of the year investors and lenders may lose patience r egarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capi tal support into the growing Touch America Furthermore the viability of t he entire business plan for Touch America could be brought into question if this asset sale is not approved by state regulators considering that Mont ana Power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the ne w telecom company The sales agreement between Montana Power and Northweste rn Corp expires March so time is also a factor Another issue that has yet to be resolved is Montana Powers intent to rais e rates to support purchases of wholesale power In other words as a tange ntial issue related to the sale of its assets state regulators also questi on how Montana Power will recover certain powersupply costs as it continue s to morph into a telecom business The company has established that it exp ects to pay nearly billion over the next years for wholesale power pu rchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company from a utility holding company and hopes to increase electric rates by percent to support these expenses Montana Power is still considered the de fault provider to about customers and needs an average of MW f or its customers However the company also needs to keep a total of MW as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep MW of reser ve power Since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to PPL Corp it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by the Montana Public Service Commission The percent rate increase reporte dly would increase residential electricity rates by about a month sta rting in July making the average bill about per month In additio n to the projected percent increase for residential customers Montana P ower estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by p ercent and medium industrial customers could see a percent increase It is important to note that a recent survey by the Great Falls Tribune conclu ded that the increase in Montana Powers rates would produce some of the h ighest residential electric rates in the Northwest Montana Power is attempting to establish longterm power contracts with sup pliers to meet its entire load requirements For instance Montana Power fo rmed a buyback agreement with PPL as a condition of the generation sale tw o years ago This contract expires July Beyond that date Montana Power announced that it signed a oneyear contract to buy MW from Duke Energy at an undisclosed price PPL also has formed a new contract to provi de MW to Montana Power over a fiveyear period after its current contra ct expires Northwestern Power the purchaser of Montana Powers distributi on system has said that it wants Montana Power to assemble a diverse packa ge of powerpurchase deals instead of buying all its load from one source to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region Mont ana Power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of powerpurchase deals to t he Montana Public Service Commission to determine the inclusion of those de als within the rate structure and the portfolio contains about threefourt hs of the MW that Montana Power will need to cover its peak demand of customers and maintain an adequate reserve The company will probably purc hase the balance of its requirements on the shortterm market Also on the legal front Montana Power continues to navigate through at le ast two litigious proceedings First in August a group of Montana Power s hareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility claiming the companys effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them billion in lost stock value The complaint filed in the District Court at Butte said the sale of Montana Power generation plants to PPL Montana in December was done without the required shareholder approval and should be overturned The suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and an estimated million in profits realized by PPL from operating the pl ants into a trust until the case is resolved What this means is that the s ale of Montana Powers generation assets are in a state of litigation even though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago Anot her lawsuit is related to Montana Powers million purchase last year o f Qwest Communications longdistance and other telephone businesses within a state service area Essentially Montana Power has launched a suit ag ainst Qwest alleging that Qwest has violated antitrust laws and constrain ed competition in the longdistance and voice and data market Consequently as Montana Power closes out the year and hits the twoyear ma rk in its transformation into Touch America the future for the company loo ks rather questionable Although there are market doubts about the future o f the telecom sector Montana Power remains confident that its longterm pr ospects as a telecom company remain very strong Nevertheless the current question for investors is how quickly and how successfully Montana can comp lete its transformation into Touch America In other words what Montana Po wer sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached The path to the compa nys final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal o bstacles An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look forward to hearing from you Nancy

Strategies of Both Compani es By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU has agreed to sell its MW coalfired West Burton power station near Retford Nottinghamshire England to London Electricity Group for GBP million US millio n In another transaction TXU also announced the sale of Eastern Electric ity its UK distribution business and its percent interest in seven the company that operates and maintains the distribution network to Lond on Electricity for GBP billion US billion London Electrici ty a distribution company that serves three million customers across Brita in is a subsidiary of Electricite de France EDF the stateowned and lar gest energy firm in France London Electricity already owns the other pe rcent of seven Analysis Its rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two ener gy companies involved in the transaction but that appears to be the case i n this deal between TXU and EDF Both companies are pursuing different stra tegies but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their respective niches in the European market The transfer of both TXUs gener ating station and the entire distribution business in the United Kingdom to the French conglomerate EDF should help both companies increase market sha re in their respective markets The divestiture enables TXU to obtain its g oal of accumulating a total of about billion in available capital to gro w its energy merchant business across Continental Europe For EDF which ai ms to gain percent of the market in Britain the sale solidifies the com panys position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its generation assets both through its London Electricity subsidiary Althou gh the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies one stu mbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingerin g frustration over EDFs expansion in other countries while the French mark et remains comparatively restricted Before moving on to the individual strategies of TXU and EDF lets establi sh what is included in the current transactions As noted the sale of the generation assets includes only the coalfired West Burton plant for which London Electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue gas desulphurization process The transaction also includes a longterm con tract for TXU to supply the station with coal TXU Europes distribution bu siness is actually the largest in the United Kingdom and includes the asse ts and wires that deliver electricity through a mile network in East Anglia and southeast England Both transactions must obtain regulatory app roval from the European Union and US regulators may review the sales as well Lets now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these t ransactions TXU Corp First it is important to note that the European expansion of Dallasbased TXU Corp is driven by the companys TXU Europe subsidiary TXUs divestitu re of its UK power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company h as been pursuing for over a year In a nutshell TXU Corp has sought to ga in billion from selling off nonstrategic assets owned by TXU Europe to support further growth of the companys core trading and merchant energy bu sinesses across the Continent In February TXU Europe announced the s ale of its gasfield assets in the North Sea to Consort Resources which wa s the first indication that the company was moving away from a hardasset s trategy TXU believes it only needs to have access to power supply through various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in Europ e Toward this end TXU Europe also recently announced the sale of its p ercent stake in Spains Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico In June TXU complet ed the divestiture of its MW Rugeley coalfired power station to Inte rnational Power In August TXU sold two gasfired power plants in Eastern England totaling MW to Centrica a British gas and home services supp lier for million Under the current sale of its UK assets TXU exits the regulated pipes an d wires business in the United Kingdom and gains available capital to suppo rt further growth in its trading business across the Continent Specificall y from both sales TXU reportedly will reach its total of billion in ava ilable financial resources and substantially exceed its previously establis hed GBP billion debtreduction target In other words proceeds from the sales reportedly will allow TXU to strengthen its financial position by red ucing debt and TXU says it expects to cut its net debttocapital ratio to percent by early However the sale of the distribution assets inc ludes a onetime writeoff of million that TXU is taking associated wi th transaction and debt restructuring The writeoff has caused TXU to redu ce its earnings by cents a share The company now expects to earn b etween to a share next year With the divestiture proceeds in hand TXU Europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading a market in which the company holds a topthree position throughout the Continent Further the asset sales ext ricates TXU from the distribution sector which it acknowledges is a busine ss that provides lower returns and declining profitability The bottom line for TXU in this and related sales is to recycle capital into the faster g rowing merchant energy business in the words of TXU Europes CEO enablin g the company to derive more than threefourths of its subsequent proceeds from this business It is important to note that TXU Europe includes genera ting trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy merchant operations TXU Europe will probably remain involved in Britains retail market where the company retains the powersupply contract to serv e million customers but the company is no longer interested in the dis tribution sector of this market Moreover it is clear that energy trading is now the core of TXUs European operations TXU Europe holds a trading volume of approximately GWh an d earlier in the parent company TXU Corp reported a percent jump i n its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading busin ess both in Europe and the United States TXU Europe still hopes to contro l physical assets in Europe as represented by its purchase this year of a percent state in Germanys Kiel utility which in terms of volumes and c ustomer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in Germany However it is clear that TXU is moving out of the UK power distribution market and its sights are more clearly focused on Continental Europe Upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the ne xt three years TXU shares fell about percent on Nov to close at In early morning trading on Nov TXU shares were priced at However Wall Street analysts indicate that the sales should increase TXU s longterm attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acqui sitions enabled by these sales Electricite de France As noted London Electricity is buying the generation and distribution asse ts from TXU but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by the Frenchgovernment owned Electricite de France Londons Electricitys parent company EDF which still maintains a practical monopoly status in F rance purchased London Electricity in for million British pounds billion from Entergy Corp Based on comments from EDF over the last year the company plans on expanding its products and services and investi ng in further strategic alliances to become a multienergy company In fact London Electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the companys strategy to consolidate its position within the United Kingdom Thus while the UK market no longer appears to be a core focus of TXU it obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a m arket share in Europe Upon completion of the transactions EDF London El ectricity will increase its share of the UK generation market to perc ent from percent and reduce the gap that currently exists between its market share of generation versus distribution in the United Kingdom Londo n Electricity already owns the Cottam power station a MW coalfired generating plant located near the West Burton plant However London Electr icity will still own far less generation capacity in the United Kingdom whe n compared to the market leaders Powergen which controls MW and In nogy which controls about MW Thus the true focus of these purchases by London Electricity may be on the distribution sector Upon completion of the transactions London Electrici ty will own Britains largest power distribution network and control about percent of the countrys distribution business Analysts have suggested that EDF overpaid for TXUs West Burton plant the buying price represented a percent premium over the plants book value but got a fair price fo r the distribution assets The point here may be that EDF was arguably will ing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock on distribution in the United Kingdom and is attempting to expand further b y gaining control over generation assets Representatives from London Elect ricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top five players in the United Kingdom and have a goal of gaining percent o f market share in the region London Electricity has been named as a conten der for the UK supply company Seaboard which current owner AEP plans to put for sale next year Seaboard serves around two million customers in Eng land in the towns of Kent Sussex and Surrey The involvement in EDF in this UK expansion has added a renewed spark to an old debate namely the growth of EDF into other European countries while competition in France remains comparatively restricted In other words ED F has been the target of intense criticism across Europe for the last sever al years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have a rgued that EDF has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely pro tecting its own turf For instance while Germany has opened percent of its power market to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and Au gust respectively While France remains rather blocked EDF has freel y admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in England Spain Ital y and possibly the United States This dichotomy may become a factor as th e current transactions with TXU fall under review of the European Union An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers

partnership will create U p to the point of this partnership Caminus and Altra were not considered d irectline competitors as Caminus business model focused on risk manageme nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions However there we re components of the companies businesses that certainly overlapped Camin us Corp has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline TradeSpark Ho ustonStreet etc Altras software which is used in the same energy tradin g portals focuses on naturalgas transactions Headquartered in New York Caminus which went public a year ago is a prov ider of software solutions and consulting services that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat ed with energy trading Toward that end the company offers two software pa ckages ZaiNet software solutions which enables energy organizations to effectiv ely trade and manage energy transactions ZaiNet has been designed to add ress a wide range of energy commodities traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and thirdparty s ystems Nucleus software systems which were designed specifically to meet the trad ing risk management scheduling and accounting needs of utilities genera ting companies power pools gas and oil producers processors pipelines and other energy market participants In other words the Caminus Nucleus s ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize track and manage thei r various energy transactions from generation to enduser delivery One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an d market positions in realtime and consequently determine acceptable risk levels Recently Caminus added the Storefront product which is a Webbased tradin g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet Also just t his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston Caminus unveiled a new so ftware product known as FrontOffice which gives traders of energy physica ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction According to company r eports approximately percent of Caminus revenue comes from software li cense sales In addition Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse s on risk management services for energy clients One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel y is its efforts along with other software companies to establish a commo n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra nsaction risk management systems A few months ago Caminus established t he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet and has since generat ed interest in some companies to participate and help create universal s tandards for energy trading One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro tocol for energy trading platforms The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions In September Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp w hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions Un der the partnership Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing transaction trading and risk management systems to create what they are calling a St raightThrough Processing STP environment for vertically integrated ener gy companies By comparison Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry Altra re portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d irect access load generation dispatch regional transmission organization RTO connectivity integrated OASIS reservations and North American Elect ric Reliability Council NERC checkout and billing Altra boasts a custome r list of about clients mostly in the gas sector but also including po wer and multifuel companies Altras software product suite includes trans action management tools known as Altra Gas Altra Power Altra Pipeline and Altra Web which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity According to Caminus the value of acquiring Altras software suite is to c reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga s and power traders Further the exchange of customers should benefit both companies Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s ervices to Altras customer base and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altras new generation of systems to Caminus customers The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp In fact Cam inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently explo ding According to Caminus CEO David Stoner the global market for wholesa le energy trading which consists of the European market is six to eight t imes the size of retail markets Consequently a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user In terestingly about to percent of the companies to which Caminus has p rovided risk management consulting services are US companies attempting t o expand in the European wholesale trading market Caminus consultants help ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA for the British go vernment due to be implemented by the end of or early Although smaller than the US market Britain has been experiencing privatization a nd various levels of deregulation since providing valuable experience and depth Besides the UK Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy Spain Holland Belgium Germany and the Nordic countries through N ORDPOOL Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently when fallou t from the events of Sept began to impact the companys business For Q Caminus reported that its total revenues increased percent to million compared to million for Q Specifically revenues from the companys software license fees increased percent to milli on during the same quarter However for Q Caminus lost or cents a share on revenue of million due primarily to the fact so me license sales that were expected to close did not Specifically Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter Given the impact that the events of Sept ha d on many companies a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke d as scheduled Moving forward Caminus says that the addition of Altras software should r esult in an increase of its revenue guidance by about percent Cami nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its Q earnings to cents a share compared with a previous estimate of cents a share al though analysts are still projecting cents a share for the fourth quarte r Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions However with these opportunities come considerable risks Hence creating this balance between risk and opp ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a nd Altra operate However the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive Every month new competitors in this space emerge so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list However so me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam inus Altra are Allegro Development KWI and SolArc to name just a few Moreover competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state The whole sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret ail market and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol esale market before it reaches the end user Thus consolidation within the energytrading software space should continue and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings Clarification Statement to IssueAlert on Dynegy In its Q ea rnings statement Dynegy

Analysis News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE shares fell sharply in ope ning trade on Nov after the humbled energy giant warned it could be for ced to pay by next week million in debt triggered by a credit downgrad e last week The shares were down or percent to just over in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange The stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the secondmost active stock on the NYSE As of early morning trading on Nov Enron shares were priced at reportedly their lowest level in nearly years Analysis To paraphrase Shakespeare Oh what a tangled web they weave whe n first they attempt to Wait I better stop When speaking about Enron I am not prepared to finish that sentence at least at this point Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks but at this junct ure an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigation has y et to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the p art of the Houston trader Enron itself has admitted that its financial rec ords from through the first half of should not be relied upon Nevertheless perception is reality and the perception currently in the ind ustry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following yea rs of skirting the truth While negative perception continues to cause dama ge to Enrons stock perhaps of more current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality We know Enron has just lowered its third quarter earnings faces a stiff payment of million due within a week in fact and has cast doubt over its Q earnings potential The question of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a material adverse change in the eyes of Dynegy which still aims to buy Enron but wi sely included an exit clause in its purchase contract The other question i s what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar A termi nated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enrons a lreadyweak credit standing and it is unknown how the company could recove r from another blow to its reputation As has been the case since the first of October the ongoing fall of Enron story is changing by the day For background on Dynegys proposed acquisi tion of Enron and Enrons financial problems that precipitated the proposa l please see my IssueAlert available at wwwscientechcomrci h In the intere st of time let me summarize what is happening at this moment Dynegy rode in as Enrons white knight and plopped down a billion offer a share to buy the company which at the time represented a steal of a price cons idering that Enron was priced at almost a share little more than a year ago To some extent this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga In other words the company had gone through a tumultuous year hit its r ock bottom but still planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy Inc its muchsmaller rival The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fa ct interrupt the nuptials between the two companies For starters on Monda y Nov Enron submitted its Q report to the SEC which was five day s late by the way In the report Enron dropped what have turned out to b e several bombshells First Enron disclosed that due to recent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moodys Standard Poors and Fi tch it has to pay off or refinance by Nov debt it owes to a third part y with which it has a partnership or face nearly billion in additional payments Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt Enron would not disclose who owns the note but we know that the limited partnership includes holdings in CEG Rio a Brazilian natural ga scompany that Enron had planned to sell to raise about million in cas h Note that just last week various credit services lowered Enrons senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned that further down grades may occur which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment Reportedly if Enron does not make the million payment by Nov inv estors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for a n amount equal to the note payable Enron is presently scrambling to establ ish a mutually acceptable amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent paymen t of million Enron said that any further drop in its credit rating mi ght necessitate further payments of billion to other partnerships the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Also in the new SEC filing Enron increased its Q loss by cents a s hare to cents Enron originally reported a Q loss of million but has now raised that figure to million As a minor bright side Enron d id increase reported earnings for the first nine months of by a penny to cents a share attributed to adjustments made after the quarters end However looking forward Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings Enron also claims that even still the numbers co ntained in the Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen the companys external auditor Thus further revision of the numbers could take place Interestingly there does not seem to be a big question about whether or no t Enron can pay the million debt obligation Enron apparently has secu red an additional billion in loans from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week In fact within the current SEC filing Enron says that i s has billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and n et collections Thus some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the million payment if it is unable to r enegotiate terms with lenders According to the SEC filing Enron also inte nds to sell off billion in noncore businesses that are performing belo w acceptable rates and would use the proceeds to pay off debts although t his money would probably not be immediately available Again however there is a perception element to this development that shou ld be noted Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past i n such a way as to keep them off the companys balance sheets Apparently this nondisclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addin g too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock As has been well documented Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inve stigation regarding potential conflictofissues involving its former CFO News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nervous about Enrons stock As I said the question of the hour is whether or not Enrons new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer As usual the answer all depends on who you ask Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enrons financial status to Enron Investors are rather mixed on the questi on Some say that the facts disclosed in the Q report do not dramaticall y change Enrons position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisi tion and that the current drop in Enrons stock is just a kneejerk respons e to the media hype surrounding the story Further those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money com ing in from various sources Thus it should have no trouble making the million payment From a broad perspective so one theory goes Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock pri ce and the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combined company as North Americas biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity In contrast other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agre ement was signed Enrons stock has fallen an additional percent whic h weakens the original acquisition agreement In addition if Enron follows through with the million payment next week or secures additional fina ncing to front this cost both options alter the companys financial positi on from when Dynegy made its original offer which could be construed as a material adverse change Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the c ompany that Dynegy agreed to purchase New reports indicate many energy tra ding companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the companys credit concerns Such companies are now particular ly reticent to sell power to Enron for nextday delivery What this means i n practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enrons ma rket share which could diminish the value in the trading market that had a ttracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place In addition Enrons oncestel lar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse altogether Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to hel p Enron out of its financial mess Of course under the acquisition agreeme nt Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate billion assetba cked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financ ial woes which will be followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco which owns percent of Dynegy However some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done an ything about Enrons diminishing ability to secure power on the open market Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron in a strategy known as sleeving The fact that Dynegy h as not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some observers th at it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron In addition Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov in state cour t in Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consi deration of other alternatives Enron said it will defend its decision in c ourt Moreover Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agr eement The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC investigat ion possible litigation against Enron balance sheet strengths and earnin gs forecasts Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enrons Q f iling with the SEC impact the companys balance sheet strengths and earning s forecasts so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to term inate the acquisition Clearly this pending deal hinges on the development s that will take place over the next few weeks Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and determin e if the oncegolden company still represents a great deal or if pursuing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved Astoria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York Ci ty clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria Energy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa ration before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a p rivately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro blems that have been identified within this region Like California New Yo rk also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t o take their own toll on the stability of the market In other words trans mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York states siting boar d to proceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it sho uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government This could be easier said than done as other planned powe r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p lant construction The problems within the New York power market have been well documented Th e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years s ince a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states abil ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin g new plants in the state However at the same time environmental and com munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem app ears to be particularly acute in New York City A November report issu ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Investigati on of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people T hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffer ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Lon g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi ssion lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily residen tial it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added De mand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyefficient and envir onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area The company is a s ubsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy development company forme d in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit will be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdN ew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b e million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on th e local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered following the experience of Sithe Energ ies the options to resolve New York Citys supply demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches including c onservation

AEP Entergy Corp and Southern Company told by FERC to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactions News item from Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FER C voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market FERC commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads If youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said FERC Cha irman Pat Wood Analysis Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERCs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend This is a mammoth ruling on FERCs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions In addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations While FERC has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the California market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions RTO Further the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition The objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading Put into a nutshell FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions I nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved RTO must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices Columbus Ohiobased American Electric Power NYSE AEP Atlantabased Sou thern Company NYSE SO and New Orleansbased Entergy Corp NYSE ETR ha ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions Note that Mirant Corp a former subsidiary of Southern Company has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent The commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate Under FERCs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power This is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of FERCs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l evel There are some important exceptions to the ruling First FERC has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a FERCapproved RTO This is signific ant as I will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in FERCs new ruling In addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved In other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling However the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary Also note that the Western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June was not inclu ded in the new ruling The three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposal s to FERC outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer Specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems OASIS the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a hour period Moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces The new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third party The new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under FERCs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases Purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own The final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid For instance if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MWh the transact ion price would be MWh Assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm What this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers Some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers price Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all US sellers nationwide What this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets Reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power The investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide FERC with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred I made a previous reference to the big stick that FERC is carrying relate d to participation in RTOs Remember that a few months ago Chairman Wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market With this in mind note that only Southern Compan y Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following FERCs consolidation mandate regarding n ational RTOs so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out This must be particularly painful for Souther n Company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five years Interestingly Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling Breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets This issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE stock sustained further he avy losses on October as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years The energy giants stock was off or percent a t per share at midday trade on Oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a thirdquarter loss of mi llion As of early morning trading on Oct Enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new Securities and Ex change inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest ors Analysis Enrons first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa rture many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci IssueAlert I argu ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re sidential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp urt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa ny operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and t he companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another

article Australia Jewel in the Crown for Some US Investors at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Oil and NaturalGas Shortages Will They Create a Winter of Discontent By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD US retail energy fuel costs already high by historical standards are expected to remain high this winter due to crude prices that are projected to remain at levels unseen since the Gulf War said the Department of Energ y on Friday In addition households that use natural gas are likely to see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills as well accord ing to the Energy Information Administration EIA The agency said US reside nts can expect heating expenditures to increase by percent for heating oil and propane and percent for natural gas ANALYSIS Despite common belief to the contrary there is a direct correlat ion between the price cycles of oil and natural gas The fact that there are legitimate concerns surrounding the availability of both power sources gives validity to the warnings of price increases this winter When fuel prices are low and naturalgas supplies are abundant there is arguably little connection between the two However the present situation as we head into winter is the exact oppositehigh oil prices and a comprised supply of natural gas leaving the two unquestionably intertwined As energ y users opt to switch from oil to natural gas this affects natural gas suppl y and raises gas prices How did we arrive at this alarming situation which may have been justifiab ly labeled an energy crisis Regarding oil in the worldwide oil indust ry witnessed a decline in oil pricesspawned in part by the economic proble ms in Asiawhich hit a low of less than a barrel in March Oil pro ducers voluntarily initiated decreased production which unsurprisingly started a swift climb in prices in as demand started to increase in a rejuvenated Asia and the United States Together this has created a volatile mix of substantially higher crude oil prices lower inventories and increased demand Even though OPEC has made promises of up to million additional barrels of crude oil per daya result of political pressure put on it by the United States and other countriesit may not be able to force its me mbers to increase production as obviously its in the best interest of oil producers to keep supplies tight and prices high In addition even if they materiali ze these increases promised by OPEC may not be enough to meet growing demand This is alarming as the United States is very reliant on foreign oil which already accounts for about half of US oil use The high price of oil has sent many customers looking for natural gas only to find that it is also in questionable supply Most reports suggest that natural gas heats about percent of all US homes The imbalance between supply and demand found in the oil industry is also found in natura l gas resulting in a projected to percent increase in heating bills this winter Over the last month prices for naturalgas futures have climb ed to record levels of more than per million Btus Yet unlike oil most of the blame placed on low supply for natural gas focuses on the United States rather than other countries A reported percent of federal lands have been placed off limits to naturalgas drillers leaving as many as million acres out of a total of billion available but restricted for naturalgas expansion The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibite d drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground At the same time EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years placing an increasingly high dependence on natural gas even though alternative fuels are not necessarily available to serve as a substitute Given the connection between oil and natural gas any successful attempt to lower oil prices would in turn help to lower naturalgas prices The ability to rely more heavily on oil once again would decrease the need for fuel switching thus reducing the present burden on natural gas Toward this end in late September President Clinton authorized the release of million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR the nations emergency oil stockpile The presidents action caused additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc y supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies Others said the million barrels would do little to ease the problem and that it would take between and million barrels a day for one month to reduce current crude oil prices So what is the solution As noted the issue has become politically polariz ed Within their campaign proposals Gov Bush proposes spending billion to open up US energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources Specifically Bush has proposed among other things opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Range which probably contains about billion barrels of oil Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the United States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell sav e a million barrels of oil a day which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to develop fuel cells alternat ive energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve But what is the answer now as winter fast approaches Unfortunately natur al gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into The degree to which the oilgas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter will depend on the weather The colder the temperature the greater the need for heating power sources which will drive up the cost for both oil and natural gas Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter one that in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past winters which were unusually mild due to La NiFa Already temperatures are dipping to surprising lows across the country Considering that it is only early October warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply will be stretched to meet demand which unquestionably will drive up the price of energy bills Looking forward much of what happens from here will depend on which candid ate is elected in November Most within the energy industry agree that more production is the only answer to supply concerns Yet expanding production will not be an easy task especially in an election year This is not an issue that is gaining high priority within Congress as politicians aim to end their session before the presidential election With such exceedingl y opposed candidates the impact that the imminent election will have on future energy policy cannot be underestimated

last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE custom ers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure tempor ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it contin ues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Online Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass Utilities By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester consumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas rates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising energy costs ANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage will send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next few months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy announced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heatin g bills that are to percent higher than their bills last winter Domini on East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to pay about more per month for natural gas from November through January And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastwhere low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearbut in the West as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about to an average bill of compar ed to last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in productio n It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand in general has grown to surprising levels Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing opportuni ty and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about per month compared Con Edisons Under its new promotion SmartEnergys plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current naturalgas rates for the next months This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to percent on their energy through the winter months The startup company also is offering United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles credit and signup bonus to entice customers away from Con Edison Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke t prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current rates for months but many others will stick with the company that they know even if their rates increase I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothi ng that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of deregulation In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu lt to beat The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is myHomeKeycom which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use the ir energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only servi ce of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that myHomeKeycom just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check energy efficiency in their homes Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the onlin e providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom Utilitycom has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilityco m plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continue s to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager to grab their own share of the retail market I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital ize on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider s DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Read about SCIENTECHs new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba Chairman and CEO of the

Winner s and Losers at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy Inc announced the launch of Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree BB portal and trading site for energy and communications commodities Dynegydirect will be introduced to Dynegy customers in a phasedin rollout that started on Oct with online trading commencing over the next sever al weeks Through the portal Dynegy customers will have selfservice access to Dynegys bid and offer prices across US power natural gas and naturalgas liquids products UK power and natural gas as well as coal emission allowances weather derivatives international naturalgas liquids and bandwidth will be offered in the coming months ANALYSIS This is a major undertaking for Dynegy but perhaps not very surprising as the company is following many of its competitors into the bigleague online trading market Dynegy is following a trail blazed by the likes of EnronOnline Entergy AEP etc in establishing a portal to enhance liquidity improve customer control and create greater trading efficiency Of the various online trading sites that have been announced Dynegydirect appears most similar to EnronOnlineclearly the leader in the fieldbecause it is principalbased In other words Dynegy will be a participant in all of the transactions either as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect will allow customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone during and following the launch of the site Over the last year Dynegy has identified its strategy as wanting to become a leader in the converging energy and communications business In addition according to Dynegys CEO Chuck Watson the companys goal is to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five years by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others Along with a strident strategy of buildin g merchant plants in areas where demand is growing significantly Dynegy presumably plans to now use its trading portal to market the power it has either generated itself or bought on the wholesale market I spoke late yesterday afternoon with Blake Young Dynegys chief informati on officer and president of Dynegy Global Technologies about the new site and how it will compete against such stiff competition First Young said that Dynegydirect is a component of a broader strategy to support Dynegy s comprehensive electronic business efforts What this means is that Dynegydirect ultimately will be much larger than just a trading portal including such other electronic businesses as eprocurement and energy supply chain management The portal will be particularly customerdriven in that it should provide many windows of opportunity for Dynegy customers to maximize their manageme nt capabilities Dynegy has been planning a trading operation for some time its growth as a power generator and marketer has been an indication that Dynegy recognized new trends in the energy industry You may recall that a few months back Dynegy teamed with Williams in investing million each for minority equity stakes in eSpeed Inc As noted in SCIENTECHs IssueAlert from Sept eSpeed is investing million in TradeSpark which plans to create electronic marketplaces for natural gas electricity coal weather derivatives nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission credits TradeSpark is using the infrastructure and capabilities of eSpeed In other words eSpeed is TradeSparks enabler As an investor in eSpeed Dynegy stands to profit from TradeSparks prelaunch market valuation of million At this point it is not clear if Dynegy intends for Dynegydirect to be a competitor to TradeSpark as Dynegy stands to profit from both trading operations How does this all relate to Dynegydirect According to Young Dynegy is pursuing commodity trading along two venues The first is a proprietary onetomany format in which Dynegy will participate in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller This operation will be conducted on the Dynegydirect portal The second venue is an anonymous manytomany format in which Dynegy will participate along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation will take place on TradeSpark which became operational in early October Dynegy is a participating member in TradeSpark along with Coral Energy Dominion Koch Energy Trading TXU Energy Trading Willi ams Energy Marketing and Trading and Cantor Fitzgerald Entergy also plans to come on board as a member and investor once its venture with Koch closes later this year Other key attributes to Dynegydirect as identified in the announcement of the site are that its highly configurable floors will enable customers to group products in a customized fashion for convenient access In additi on customers can trade on multiple floors simultaneously and the sites realtime price updates will allow them to see prices on all of their floors enablin g them to make immediate decisions on prices and volumes Young said that Dynegy is extremely confident that the portals technology will be well accepted as it is JAVAbased meaning among other things that it is flexible enough to operate between MACs and IBMs and objectoriented While these are important from an IT perspective as would be important to CIO Young perhaps more importantly is that the site offers an opportuni ty for Dynegy to support the growth of its businesses and offers a costefficiency tool for customers In August Dynegy announced that it is acquiring Extant a privately held Coloradobased communications solutions and ecommerce company Extants primary line of business is in providing connectivity solutions and broadba nd capacity to communications businesses and information providers enabling them to exchange information and provide voice data and video services to their customers The acquisition will mark Dynegys first significant penetration into the telecommunications sector While not directly related to this new portal the acquisition of Extant is relevant because Dynegy intends to eventually trade broadband capacity on the site Extants broadb and capacity will help to support Dynegys trading of this commodity While the move to online trading is a smart and almost inevitable decisio n for Dynegy and other energy companies wanting to remain competitive the competition and risk associated with this venture are formidable Clearly Dynegy has found a market edge with its eSpeed TradeSpark affiliation TradeSpark is already up and running as compared to many announced trading sites that have launch dates next year In addition TradeSpark is creating a large liquidity pool by bringing together several mediums including the Internet voice brokering and eSpeeds millisecond private global network The manytomany format which Dynegy is pursuing through TradeSpar k is an obvious route for the company to follow and one with considerably less risks associated with it On the other hand building its own Dynegydirect in which Dynegy is the principal player sounds like a Herculean task For perspective Enron was the first company that came out of the gate with an online energy trading portal EnronOnline has a month leadal ong with transactions in excess of billionahead of Dynegy or any comp any that is just now developing a trading portal It appears that Dynegy plans to build Dynegydirect from the ground up unlike its involvement in TradeSpark which is already up and running This could become a lengthy and costly endeavor As I finished writing this analysis Dynegy reported thirdquarter earnings of per share In particular Dynegy reported that recurring net income from Dynegy Marketing and Trading increased to million representing percent of Dynegys consolidated net income compared to million in the third quarter of Obviously Dynegys commodities marketing and trading operation is on a very significant growth mode The launch of Dynegydirectalong with ongoing participation in TradeSparkis a k ey element of this growth DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Chairman President and CEO of American Electric Power is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Department of Energy will have more than million for fuel cell related programs in the new fiscal year million above the presidents request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed upon million for stationary fuel cells million more than request ed and approved the full request of million for transportation fuel cell research and million for buildings ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than expect ed should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel cells Although generally considered the favorite of low zero emission energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently availab le in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since batteries were discovered years ago but the high cost of producing them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest million in Energy Conversion Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals significant support from the federal government In addition warnings about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as oppose d to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without burni ng producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need recharg ing although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero pollution are very appealing Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of generation available for widespread use by or Under the DOE grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In addition the funding allocates million to transportation fuel cell research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile application s The million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy pe fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator for buildings and other research and development Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As custom ers possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional busine ss of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have drama tic financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabam a Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity at a reported efficiency of about percent compared with percent for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system of MercedesBenz Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about million in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the partnership Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke ts for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through distribu ted generation products such as fuel cells These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential for the automotive fuel cell market at billion annually by and as high as billion cumulative for the stationary power markets withi n years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers Yet the distributed generation market should become much tighter once fuel cells become commercially available something that this hefty new grant from the US government should push forward DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD El Paso Global Networks plans to spend up to billion in the next few years on telecom acquisitions Find

latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one o f New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts t o support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO which has run the states wholesale power market since The NYSEG report titled New York States Electr ic Energy Crisis and NYSEGs Comprehensive Solution criticizes the NYISO fo r not giving power consumers price certainty in the transition from local monopolies to an open competitive market Analysis New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener gy markets as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou t an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season However unlike California which basically faces a power supply problem th at can be improved over time New York arguably suffers from a more severe and permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved Like its West Coast counterpart New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance a nd local resistance that thwarts new generation development However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin ue to take their own toll on the stability of the market Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o n each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe r As noted in its new report NYSEG a subsidiary of Energy East NYSE EAS is especially critical of NYISO which it says has contributed to soaring wholesale prices in New York NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining unrealistic goals for new power supply not providing accurate price signal s to energy customers and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems Yet beyond the finger pointing some essential facts can be established o n which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree According to data included in the NYISO report between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state increased only by MW New York has not brought a new plant online sin ce when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven year s since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate In addition New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks Deficie nt transmission systems in central New York around New York City and at the outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than can be imported into the state New York City is relatively isolated from t he transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o n citybased power supply New York Citys load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incity capacity along with imports t o meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall These projections presume normal weather conditions If New York experiences a warmerthannormal summer th e outlook gets even worse Further according to a report from New Yorks State Attorney General between and capital improvements to New Yorks transmission syste m dropped from million per year to million per year At the presen t time only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is scheduled A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut would provide Long Island with about MW of additional power and increas e its import capacity by about percent Unless this transmission expansion is expedited it is not scheduled for operation until Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York most certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th e use of air conditioners pushing demand to annual highs While NYSEG and th e NYISO may agree on the nature of New Yorks problems a contentious debate has emerged with regard to finding a solution In its own proposal release d in early March the NYISO focused on building new generation expediting siting processes improving transmission lines and conservation efforts I n one of its key proposals the NYISO urged the creation of MW of new electricity roughly percent of New Yorks peak demand by with up to MW of that generation being made available by the end of NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for falling short in its assessment o f the magnitude of the crisis and issued its own proposals in its recent report For instance NYSEG officials said that NYISO had grossly oversimplified the situation and that considering the tenuous state of power construction in New York the objective of establishing MW by was extremely unrealistic In turn NYSEG says that a robust wholesa le electric market will not materialize in New York until assuming that measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately In earl y March NYSEG released the NYSEGPlan outlining six steps which it believe s contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition to a competitive market in New York In summary the NYSEGPlan includes Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants Adding to the states transmission capacity Adding to the states naturalgas supply infrastructure Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers by encouraging interruptible load where feasible and building the technological infrastructure necessary for realtime pricing Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan in which electric rates would be frozen for seven years by July However while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals the same obstacles inherent in New Yorks market might also thwart its own ener gy plan For instance topping the list of NYSEGs six steps is an emphasis on establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and approval process This may be easier said than done As I mentioned in my IssueAlert the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th e lobbying force that community groups in California wield In that column I discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in Ramapo NY from an MW combinedcycle facility to a MW peaking unit due to opposition raised by local residents In addition just yesterday a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort s by the New York Power Authority NYPA to build two MW gasfired generators in the borough of Queens The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to cease all construction on the units and ruled that the power authority violated state environmentalreview laws to its efforts to rush the plant into service by June In response NYPA has said that the plantsalong w ith nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York Cityare need ed to prevent power outages this summer NYPA continues to face fierce opposition from community groups many of them launching lawsuits who do not want the generation units in their neighborhoods Consequently the supply demand imbalance in New York is a very serious matter and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless blackouts occur Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines surrounding New York State and New York City are solved adding new power supply assuming that generation development can move past community opposition would not be enough to bring more balance to the market In the interim conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c an user to abate power outages this summer but again the general public may n ot fully understand the need to reduce their power usage New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for nearterm problems First expedite the building of new generation sources including distribution generation alternatives This assumes that gas lines will be sufficient to import necessary fuel Second allow the economy of New York City to stagnate as a result of the supply demand imbalance which will drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand And third focu s on conservation efforts which again may not work until residents are directly impacted by outages The city may choose a combination of all thre e approaches or decide to focus on just one However to address the immediat e concerns it does not appear that New York has any options besides this threetier approach One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne w York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture Although it is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated divestiture utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur e to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most of their power plants NYSEG the author of the new report on New Yorks power problems is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will remain only in the transmission business This most likely creates a heightened sensitivity on NYSEGs part with regard to the power supply shortages presently facing New York Again we now have two states that represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility model becomes dismantled Of course it is not fair to say that divestiture is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York but taking away a utilitys ability to effectively control is own power supply costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters California Gov Gray Davis billion dollar plan to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators Legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill One Assembly official called the SCE bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years Analysis Even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too farfetched to be possible The only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between Gov Davis and SCE is the cashstrapped utility California energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems Thus despite the hype with which Gov Davis announced this rescue plan for SCE California legislatorsboth Republicans and Democratsare saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands As it becomes apparent that the California Legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that Gov Davis offer to SCE is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to California residents For background on the details of Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE please reference my IssueAlert from In a nutshell the state of California agreed to buy SCEs mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the systems book value SCE would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability Both the California Legislature and the CPUC need to approve this deal by Aug or else the agreement is terminated In the highly politicized climate under which the California energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses For instance keep in mind that Gov Davis political career has been severely damaged by the states energy crisis and the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Co Californias largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governors standing Perhaps more than any other goal Davis wants to keep SCE from also filing for Chapter protection In addition Davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the states transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent Normally a measure supported by the Democratic governor could be easily approved by Californias Democratcontrolled legislature However the energy issue has divided support for Davis even within his own party Consequently the governor needs the support of both Republicans and Democrats in order to see his rescue plan for SCE pass For its part there was very little reason why SCE should not have agreed to the governors terms From multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governors offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings Under the agreement SCE gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years Further its parent company Edison International gets to hold on to a reported billion that SCE has provided to the corporate operation since The exception to this is a million tax refund that Edison International would give back to SCE While Davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that SCE has taken the governor to the cleaners Meanwhile California customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets The state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to SCE customers It is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase In addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down SCEs debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators Consequently California customers would bear the responsibility for prices that FERC has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable Ultimately however it is the California Legislature and CPUC that will have the authority to approve the agreement between Gov Davis and SCE These two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders Presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan For instance what value would there be in the California government owning only one portion of the states interconnected transmission system PGOCorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state No agreement with Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas Electric has been reached either Thus if the Gov Davis SCE agreement is approved the state of California would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state Many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along PGEs portion of the grid The counterargument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings PGOmay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state The bankruptcy judge would make this decision Thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining PGEs transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with SCE The second fundamental problem is that causing California legislators to turn their back on the governors plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for SCE and its parent company Some reportedly believe that Gov Davis rushed into an overly generous offer for SCE out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with PGE As noted the billion offer for SCEs assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb Currently SCE customers pay a FERCapproved transmission rate based upon a costplus formula If the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines In addition some legislators including former Democratic allies of Gov Davis have suggested that SCE should be forced to enter bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co has done Naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan Looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that SCE declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for California customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates This will be a major political challenge for California legislators to resolve if the governors plan becomes sponsored as a bill If I pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case I would predict that there is little chance that Gov Davis rescue plan for SCE will pass in its current form The energy crisis in California has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return It is Gov Davis personal agenda to obtain control over the states transmission assets but I dont see this as being a priority for other California lawmakers Thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning SCEs transmission assets in the states best interest Considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area I dont see this occurring Consequently the game is by no means over for SCE and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent One large California utility is already in bankruptcy court We could be only

IssueAlert October Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one

Reuters Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN agreed on Nov to acquir e rival Enron Corp NYSE ENE for some billion in stock underlining t he dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houstonbased energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly billion Enrons stock fell sharpl y in the past month due to investors concerns about murky transactions tha t sparked an investigation by US regulators and damaging downgrades by cr edit rating agencies The merged company will retain the Dynegy name It wi ll have annual revenues of more than billion and assets worth bill ion including more than megawatts of electricity generating capacit y and miles of naturalgas pipelines It will be North Americas big gest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity positions previous ly held by Enron Analysis Well its now official The announcement of what presumably will be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end o f last week It is indeed a dramatic end Enron the maverick and innovativ e company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated m arkets in the energy industry will no longer exist after what has been a v ery quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months Dy negy the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach toward success is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and l ocking in much of the industry market share of Enron Can there be any doub t that this is the energy industrys manifestation of the tortoise and the hare parable Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy but is making a sm art choice to be bought considering its desperate circumstances and the un likelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own For Dynegy this acquisition is a major win as the combination will create the biggest and strongest energy merchant in the world There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal Before addre ssing some issues related to the approval of the deal lets establish some of the key points of the merger agreement There have been some mixed repo rts but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about a share quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was tra ding at close to a share and had a market value of nearly billion Under terms of the agreement Enron shareholders will receive Dynegy shares per share of Enron common stock Dynegys current stockholders inc luding ChevronTexaco Corp which currently owns percent of Dynegy will own approximately percent of the combined company while Enrons stockh olders will own approximately percent of the combined companys stock at closing In addition Dynegy will provide an immediate billion assetbacked equ ity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined comp any by ChevronTexaco Chuck Watson chairman and CEO of Dynegy will retain his position at the new company Steve Bergstrom president of Dynegy and Rob Doty chief financial officer will retain their positions at the new company It is not presently known what role if any Ken Lay current CEO of Enron will hold at the new company Of course this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fal len into a very vulnerable spot this year Quite literally Enron was pushe d into this deal because it was running out of cash its stock had tanked a nd its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels all within the last several weeks Enrons decline over the course of has been the result of losses in its telecom sector losses from its involvement in India the departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling a Securities and Exchange Co mmission SEC investigation into some of its business practices and lack of investor confidence about Enrons honesty in its financial reporting Th is last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had ov erstated earnings by percent over the last four years and investors shou ld disregard the companys financial statements from through the first half of The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced million from Enrons reported profits In addition Enron revised its debt upward in each year from to At the end of Enrons de bt was billion million more than it had previously reported B y not reporting this debt earlier Enron presumably was able to maintain a stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been dis closed The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enrons successful energy t rading business In addition Dynegy could also find synergies in Enrons r etail unit Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline the companys electronic trading unit Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect whi ch was launched after Enron gained the firststrike advantage in this marke t space Details are still emerging but it would make sense if Dynegy opte d to not purchase other units under Enrons business structure such as the companys water and telecom businesses which are losing money Dynegy has its own telecom unit which has also lost money this year so it may not w ant to expand in this slowgrowing sector at this time Vivendi Environneme nt a French company that has expanded into various lines of business has reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix Enro ns struggling water subsidiary Note that Enron sold Azurix North America to American Water Works The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dyn egy and Enron shareholders Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent u pon any possible downgrades on its longterm debt that Dynegy could encount er with the purchase of Enron At this juncture it does not appear that Dy negy will be downgraded but this is a fastchanging story and conditions c ould change abruptly Financing the deal may also be an issue even with th e infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco Dynegy reportedly has billion worth of debt and has a market capitalization of billion Thus Enron s own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb a concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal This issue co uld be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enrons assets and if there is some repair work done on Enrons balance sheets The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult as the combination of the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market po wer and antitrust issues The review of this merger will be unprecedented considering that the wholesale naturalgas and electricity trading market i s still fairly young Certainly a deal of this magnitude has not previousl y occurred in the deregulating energy industry It is not presently clear w hich regulatory agency will be involved in the review although the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department could all be involved FERC would most likely become inv olved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset su ch as a pipeline FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured so lely as an exchange of stock Not involving FERC would be more advantageous for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly s horter An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items fo r regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dyne gy would hold market power in the naturalgas trading space which could pr eempt market entry by other competitors The combined company would be con siderably larger than its nearest competitors Scope and scale are consider ed the top competitive assets in the trading sector and the combination of Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance It will fa ll on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it p recludes other competitors from emerging into the same space To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatem ent The two rival companies followed very different paths to success Enro n under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular espoused an unor thodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order to achieve success in the energytrading space Dynegy on the other hand approached the market from the opposite perspective and diligently acquir ed diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally t o support its trading operation Up until the start of it appeared th at Enrons strategy was the more successful of the two Enron with bi llion in revenues and billion in profits in ranked fifth on Fortun e s list of largest US companies In contrast Dynegy ranked on th e same list and had billion in revenues and million in earnings H owever turned out to be Dynegys year and the success continued into the very year that would bring Enrons downfall Enrons problems cul minated in million in losses in the third quarter after taking billion in charges associated with several of its noncore businesses Take n with the other factors plaguing the company Enron became exceptionally v ulnerable and prone to a takeover which has now provided Dynegy with a str ong gain The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegys size and should imm ediately provide an accretive earnings contribution Further Dynegy claims that it expects a to percent annual earnings growth over the next t hree years following its planned acquisition of Enron If it gains all of t he necessary regulatory approvals Dynegy will become the undisputed market leader in the energy industry with annual revenues of billion and billion in assets The company will have MW of generating capacity which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating MW by In other words the combined company will dwarf any oth er competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its neare st competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size resources an d assets Word of the acquisition caused Enrons shares to increase some one of the few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months S hares of Enron rose cents or percent to in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov As of early morning trade on Nov Enron shares were priced at Shares of Dynegy gained or percent to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

Winner s and Losers at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Dynegy Launches BB Portal and Trading Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Dynegy Inc announced the launch of Dynegydirect an Internetbased commissionfree BB portal and trading site for energy and communications commodities Dynegydirect will be introduced to Dynegy customers in a phasedin rollout that started on Oct with online trading commencing over the next sever al weeks Through the portal Dynegy customers will have selfservice access to Dynegys bid and offer prices across US power natural gas and naturalgas liquids products UK power and natural gas as well as coal emission allowances weather derivatives international naturalgas liquids and bandwidth will be offered in the coming months ANALYSIS This is a major undertaking for Dynegy but perhaps not very surprising as the company is following many of its competitors into the bigleague online trading market Dynegy is following a trail blazed by the likes of EnronOnline Entergy AEP etc in establishing a portal to enhance liquidity improve customer control and create greater trading efficiency Of the various online trading sites that have been announced Dynegydirect appears most similar to EnronOnlineclearly the leader in the fieldbecause it is principalbased In other words Dynegy will be a participant in all of the transactions either as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect will allow customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone during and following the launch of the site Over the last year Dynegy has identified its strategy as wanting to become a leader in the converging energy and communications business In addition according to Dynegys CEO Chuck Watson the companys goal is to gain a percent share or MW of the US electric market over the next five years by acquiring plants building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others Along with a strident strategy of buildin g merchant plants in areas where demand is growing significantly Dynegy presumably plans to now use its trading portal to market the power it has either generated itself or bought on the wholesale market I spoke late yesterday afternoon with Blake Young Dynegys chief informati on officer and president of Dynegy Global Technologies about the new site and how it will compete against such stiff competition First Young said that Dynegydirect is a component of a broader strategy to support Dynegy s comprehensive electronic business efforts What this means is that Dynegydirect ultimately will be much larger than just a trading portal including such other electronic businesses as eprocurement and energy supply chain management The portal will be particularly customerdriven in that it should provide many windows of opportunity for Dynegy customers to maximize their manageme nt capabilities Dynegy has been planning a trading operation for some time its growth as a power generator and marketer has been an indication that Dynegy recognized new trends in the energy industry You may recall that a few months back Dynegy teamed with Williams in investing million each for minority equity stakes in eSpeed Inc As noted in SCIENTECHs IssueAlert from Sept eSpeed is investing million in TradeSpark which plans to create electronic marketplaces for natural gas electricity coal weather derivatives nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission credits TradeSpark is using the infrastructure and capabilities of eSpeed In other words eSpeed is TradeSparks enabler As an investor in eSpeed Dynegy stands to profit from TradeSparks prelaunch market valuation of million At this point it is not clear if Dynegy intends for Dynegydirect to be a competitor to TradeSpark as Dynegy stands to profit from both trading operations How does this all relate to Dynegydirect According to Young Dynegy is pursuing commodity trading along two venues The first is a proprietary onetomany format in which Dynegy will participate in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller This operation will be conducted on the Dynegydirect portal The second venue is an anonymous manytomany format in which Dynegy will participate along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation will take place on TradeSpark which became operational in early October Dynegy is a participating member in TradeSpark along with Coral Energy Dominion Koch Energy Trading TXU Energy Trading Willi ams Energy Marketing and Trading and Cantor Fitzgerald Entergy also plans to come on board as a member and investor once its venture with Koch closes later this year Other key attributes to Dynegydirect as identified in the announcement of the site are that its highly configurable floors will enable customers to group products in a customized fashion for convenient access In additi on customers can trade on multiple floors simultaneously and the sites realtime price updates will allow them to see prices on all of their floors enablin g them to make immediate decisions on prices and volumes Young said that Dynegy is extremely confident that the portals technology will be well accepted as it is JAVAbased meaning among other things that it is flexible enough to operate between MACs and IBMs and objectoriented While these are important from an IT perspective as would be important to CIO Young perhaps more importantly is that the site offers an opportuni ty for Dynegy to support the growth of its businesses and offers a costefficiency tool for customers In August Dynegy announced that it is acquiring Extant a privately held Coloradobased communications solutions and ecommerce company Extants primary line of business is in providing connectivity solutions and broadba nd capacity to communications businesses and information providers enabling them to exchange information and provide voice data and video services to their customers The acquisition will mark Dynegys first significant penetration into the telecommunications sector While not directly related to this new portal the acquisition of Extant is relevant because Dynegy intends to eventually trade broadband capacity on the site Extants broadb and capacity will help to support Dynegys trading of this commodity While the move to online trading is a smart and almost inevitable decisio n for Dynegy and other energy companies wanting to remain competitive the competition and risk associated with this venture are formidable Clearly Dynegy has found a market edge with its eSpeed TradeSpark affiliation TradeSpark is already up and running as compared to many announced trading sites that have launch dates next year In addition TradeSpark is creating a large liquidity pool by bringing together several mediums including the Internet voice brokering and eSpeeds millisecond private global network The manytomany format which Dynegy is pursuing through TradeSpar k is an obvious route for the company to follow and one with considerably less risks associated with it On the other hand building its own Dynegydirect in which Dynegy is the principal player sounds like a Herculean task For perspective Enron was the first company that came out of the gate with an online energy trading portal EnronOnline has a month leadal ong with transactions in excess of billionahead of Dynegy or any comp any that is just now developing a trading portal It appears that Dynegy plans to build Dynegydirect from the ground up unlike its involvement in TradeSpark which is already up and running This could become a lengthy and costly endeavor As I finished writing this analysis Dynegy reported thirdquarter earnings of per share In particular Dynegy reported that recurring net income from Dynegy Marketing and Trading increased to million representing percent of Dynegys consolidated net income compared to million in the third quarter of Obviously Dynegys commodities marketing and trading operation is on a very significant growth mode The launch of Dynegydirectalong with ongoing participation in TradeSparkis a k ey element of this growth DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Chairman President and CEO of American Electric Power is now available Find out more at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD The Department of Energy will have more than million for fuel cell related programs in the new fiscal year million above the presidents request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed upon million for stationary fuel cells million more than request ed and approved the full request of million for transportation fuel cell research and million for buildings ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than expect ed should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel cells Although generally considered the favorite of low zero emission energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently availab le in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since batteries were discovered years ago but the high cost of producing them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest million in Energy Conversion Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals significant support from the federal government In addition warnings about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as oppose d to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without burni ng producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need recharg ing although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero pollution are very appealing Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of generation available for widespread use by or Under the DOE grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In addition the funding allocates million to transportation fuel cell research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile application s The million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy pe fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator for buildings and other research and development Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As custom ers possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional busine ss of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have drama tic financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabam a Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity at a reported efficiency of about percent compared with percent for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system of MercedesBenz Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about million in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the partnership Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke ts for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through distribu ted generation products such as fuel cells These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential for the automotive fuel cell market at billion annually by and as high as billion cumulative for the stationary power markets withi n years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers Yet the distributed generation market should become much tighter once fuel cells become commercially available something that this hefty new grant from the US government should push forward DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD El Paso Global Networks plans to spend up to billion in the next few years on telecom acquisitions Find

<6867947.1075846347498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,issuealert@scientech.com,2000-10-30 03:22:00,SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch SCIENTECH IssueAlert October SCE California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans FERC to Meet This Week By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Southern California Edison SCE filed a fourpoint plan calling on the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to act by years end to settle the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting from Californias dysfunctional electricity market This follows a separate measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy purchases FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov to discuss the California power market and remedies for the states troubled move to deregulate retail service which caused drastic price spikes this summer ANALYSIS This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding Californias energy market FERCs meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market First lets establish what SCE is proposing SCE has petitioned the CPUC to take four immediate steps Support market reform by providing utilities with greater freedom to contract for longerterm supplies of power completing review of SCEs bilateral contract proposals and rectifying market structure problems that have become apparent Confirm that utilities will be able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers Implement a postratefreeze rate stabilization plan instead of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile wholesale power costs and provide for a modest rate increase beginning Jan to avoid larger future increases and End the uncertainty about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets I think this can all be translated as follows SCE and presumably PGE want to overturn Californias strong resistance against bilateral contracts Under California restructuring law the local distribution company must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange Bilateral contracts with generators are largely prohibited meaning that currently in California suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities as is allowed in other states such as Texas SCE and PGE are both in severe debt due to accumulated undercollection resulting from the disparity between the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service territories SCEs debt is about billion while PGEs debt could be as much as billion Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their debt SCE and PGE want to avoid the skyhigh prices that San Diego Gas Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to marketbased prices this summer SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase rates by less than percent keeping rates at levels when adjusted for inflation SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more formal proposal to the CPUC but believes that the lessthan percent increase would be sufficient to recoup its billion debt if it were in place for four to five years AB strongly encouraged that the California IOUs divest their power plants as part of the agreements for stranded cost recovery SCE sold naturalgas plants and presently has two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of plants currently in escrow and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed The California ISOs proposal is more specific but also geared toward market stabilization The CalISO wants to implement a MWh bid cap reduced from MWh on electricity purchases in the ISOs spot market However the CalISOs plan includes several exemptions including those generators that can prove they will lose money at the rate generators that contract percent of their supply to serve California customers and generators producing less than MW renewable power imported power etc Thus the current rate cap of MWh would remain in place and serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from the payment cap Further the CalISO wants to require that generators contract percent of their capacity in forward markets and that users schedule at least percent of their load in forward markets The CalISO contends that California IOUs should be easily able to schedule percent of their load by entering into contracts with generators The CalISO wants to affix a realtime deficiency charge on both generators and users that do not use the forward markets The CalISO submitted its plan to FERC because it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California but on a national basis Although the CalISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its own state The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden on the CalISOs RealTime Market which was designed to handle only percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets but in fact is handling about to percent The CalISO proposal seems to be taking into account the problem of an outofsync wholesaleretail market by encouraging generation to stay in the state Otherwise capped generators may sell power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed per megawatt hour in the neighboring states Should FERC approve this national rate cap however it will be precedent setting and will signal that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated As noted FERC plans to meet on Nov to examine the California market in detail FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late August with its investigation focused on the summers price spikes the states market structure including the CalISO and the Power Exchange as well as marketbased sellers in California The meeting this week reportedly will disclose findings from FERCs investigation and consider proposed remedies SCEs proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on FERCs agenda for approval However it is likely that whatever FERC decides will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCEs plan In particular FERC will be examining the issue of market power and whether or not any generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system by withholding generation to drive up energy prices And the problem is by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer Even though the summer demand season has now ended wholesale prices remain high a problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural gas across the country SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple questions to complex problems

connection to EnronOnline and receives equity investmen t from PGE Find out more about SCIENTECHS ECommerce InfoGrid at DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Discover a world of utilities information in our new ezine SourceBook Online

bills every yearbut in the West as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see their winter bills increase by about to an average bill of compar ed to last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in productio n It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand in general has grown to surprising levels Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing opportuni ty and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about per month compared Con Edisons Under its new promotion SmartEnergys plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current naturalgas rates for the next months This promotion comes at an ideal time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can expect to save up to percent on their energy through the winter months The startup company also is offering United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles credit and signup bonus to entice customers away from Con Edison Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke t prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current rates for months but many others will stick with the company that they know even if their rates increase I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothi ng that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of deregulation In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu lt to beat The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is myHomeKeycom which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use the ir energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only servi ce of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that myHomeKeycom just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check energy efficiency in their homes Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the onlin e providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom Utilitycom has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilityco m plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continue s to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager to grab their own share of the retail market I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital ize on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider s DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Read about SCIENTECHs new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba Chairman and CEO of the

last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE custom ers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure tempor ary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans fer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it contin ues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

article Australia Jewel in the Crown for Some US Investors at webrciwebnsfWebPagesSBEntrancehtml DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October Oil and NaturalGas Shortages Will They Create a Winter of Discontent By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD US retail energy fuel costs already high by historical standards are expected to remain high this winter due to crude prices that are projected to remain at levels unseen since the Gulf War said the Department of Energ y on Friday In addition households that use natural gas are likely to see the largest yearonyear percentage increase in their bills as well accord ing to the Energy Information Administration EIA The agency said US reside nts can expect heating expenditures to increase by percent for heating oil and propane and percent for natural gas ANALYSIS Despite common belief to the contrary there is a direct correlat ion between the price cycles of oil and natural gas The fact that there are legitimate concerns surrounding the availability of both power sources gives validity to the warnings of price increases this winter When fuel prices are low and naturalgas supplies are abundant there is arguably little connection between the two However the present situation as we head into winter is the exact oppositehigh oil prices and a comprised supply of natural gas leaving the two unquestionably intertwined As energ y users opt to switch from oil to natural gas this affects natural gas suppl y and raises gas prices How did we arrive at this alarming situation which may have been justifiab ly labeled an energy crisis Regarding oil in the worldwide oil indust ry witnessed a decline in oil pricesspawned in part by the economic proble ms in Asiawhich hit a low of less than a barrel in March Oil pro ducers voluntarily initiated decreased production which unsurprisingly started a swift climb in prices in as demand started to increase in a rejuvenated Asia and the United States Together this has created a volatile mix of substantially higher crude oil prices lower inventories and increased demand Even though OPEC has made promises of up to million additional barrels of crude oil per daya result of political pressure put on it by the United States and other countriesit may not be able to force its me mbers to increase production as obviously its in the best interest of oil producers to keep supplies tight and prices high In addition even if they materiali ze these increases promised by OPEC may not be enough to meet growing demand This is alarming as the United States is very reliant on foreign oil which already accounts for about half of US oil use The high price of oil has sent many customers looking for natural gas only to find that it is also in questionable supply Most reports suggest that natural gas heats about percent of all US homes The imbalance between supply and demand found in the oil industry is also found in natura l gas resulting in a projected to percent increase in heating bills this winter Over the last month prices for naturalgas futures have climb ed to record levels of more than per million Btus Yet unlike oil most of the blame placed on low supply for natural gas focuses on the United States rather than other countries A reported percent of federal lands have been placed off limits to naturalgas drillers leaving as many as million acres out of a total of billion available but restricted for naturalgas expansion The Clinton administration and environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibite d drilling for natural gas or oil in states like Alaska where some trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground At the same time EPA standards have become so pronatural gas over the last decade that few coalfired plants have been built in the last years placing an increasingly high dependence on natural gas even though alternative fuels are not necessarily available to serve as a substitute Given the connection between oil and natural gas any successful attempt to lower oil prices would in turn help to lower naturalgas prices The ability to rely more heavily on oil once again would decrease the need for fuel switching thus reducing the present burden on natural gas Toward this end in late September President Clinton authorized the release of million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR the nations emergency oil stockpile The presidents action caused additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc y supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies Others said the million barrels would do little to ease the problem and that it would take between and million barrels a day for one month to reduce current crude oil prices So what is the solution As noted the issue has become politically polariz ed Within their campaign proposals Gov Bush proposes spending billion to open up US energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources Specifically Bush has proposed among other things opening percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Range which probably contains about billion barrels of oil Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal land and instead aims to protect the US environment increase reliance on lowpollution fuels and focus on energyefficiency lower consumption programs Articulating the Democratic position on this issue Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential debate There are more resources within the United States If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a millionwell sav e a million barrels of oil a day which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produceWeve got to develop fuel cells alternat ive energy Weve got to encourage people to conserve But what is the answer now as winter fast approaches Unfortunately natur al gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into The degree to which the oilgas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter will depend on the weather The colder the temperature the greater the need for heating power sources which will drive up the cost for both oil and natural gas Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter one that in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past winters which were unusually mild due to La NiFa Already temperatures are dipping to surprising lows across the country Considering that it is only early October warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply will be stretched to meet demand which unquestionably will drive up the price of energy bills Looking forward much of what happens from here will depend on which candid ate is elected in November Most within the energy industry agree that more production is the only answer to supply concerns Yet expanding production will not be an easy task especially in an election year This is not an issue that is gaining high priority within Congress as politicians aim to end their session before the presidential election With such exceedingl y opposed candidates the impact that the imminent election will have on future energy policy cannot be underestimated

to Exelon Sale Supports Strategies of Both Companies By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PRNewswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU and Exelon Generation ann ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gasfired electric generating pla nts to Exelon Generation a subsidiary of Exelon Corp NYSE EXC for million The transaction involving two DallasFort Worth plants with a co mbined capacity of MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres ence in the Texas region enhancing its geographic and market diversity wh ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas Analysis Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st rategies of both companies particularly well TXU one of the largest gener ation companies in the world has been attempting to expand out of its home state of Texas for some time following competitive opportunities as they are presented by electric deregulation The company which will maintain a presence in the Texas market has already expanded internationally into cou ntries such as Australia and Europe and will mostly likely use the proceed s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni ted States For Exelon the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex as market which becomes fully competitive next week and provides a partic ularly valuable inroad into the highdemand region of DallasFort Worth Lets first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is selling to Exelon As noted the combined capacity of the two plants is abo ut MW One of the plants is the MW Handley Steam Electric Stati on which is located southeast of Fort Worth According to TXU bar rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oilgas units at the plant Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington The first unit was put into operation in with the additional units coming on line in and The other plant being sold is the MW Mountain Creek St eam Electric Station which is located about two miles west of Loop in D allas With the first oilgas unit established in four more units wer e added in and Both sales include the generating un its of the plants along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo r them to operate land water rights transmission interconnections gas p ipeline interconnections production facilities and emission allowances The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr etty straightforward From TXUs perspective the sales will reduce the com panys generation concentration in a single US market which up to this p oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas Proceeds from the sale apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke ts outside of Texas In addition proceeds from the sale will be used to st rengthen TXUs balance sheet by reducing debt something that has become in creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s pace since the bankruptcy of marketleader Enron It is important to note t hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market and still intends to operate in the state as a generation company and retailer Note that according to Texas restructuring law there must be a wall between the two operating uni ts which must function as separate companies In essence the divestiture is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w ill support growth into other markets and reduce the amount of potential m arket power that the company may have in Texas The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l atter half of this year considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene rgy Regulatory Commission FERC have forced several other companies to cha rge costbased prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to hold market power in their particular service territories Texas law allow s a company to own and control no more than percent of capacity within t he Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT and TXU claims that it is within this cap However TXU acknowledges that it had an overconcentrati on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar kets Excluding the sold facilities TXU will now own MW of net capa city which are still located primarily in Texas However it is becoming c lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market From Exelons perspective the sale expands the companys generating capaci ty by about percent which is an important increase considering that Exe lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industrys largest assetbased traders Exelon which was created as a result of the merger b etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison is known mostly for its strong nuclear capabilities In fact Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry owning a total of reactors that produce about MW of power Exelon may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio Exelo n Power which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU ov ersees Exelons portfolio of coal natural gas oil landfill gas and hydr o generating assets which include intermediate and peaking units in Pen nsylvania and Maryland capable of producing MW of net generating cap acity Thus Exelons purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e ffort to diversify both regionally and from a powersource perspective fr om the companys previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast Perhaps equally important the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas market which represents the secondlargest energy market behind Californ ia offering a market value of about billion Now that California is n o longer a competitive energy market there are high hopes that Texas will prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state next week On Jan most customers of investorowned utilities in Te xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider REPth e company that provides their electricity As a whole the Texas energy mar ket represents MW of generation operating on a mile transmiss ion network One of Exelons main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as sets and position itself as one of the nations toptier energy suppliers Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon which up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago to Pennsylvania This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into the Texas market In the summer of Exelon began operating a new MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston Prior to that Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from two other plants in Texas MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and M W from the Wolf Hollow plant It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma rket especially on the wholesale side of the business and thus there are fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract Unde r the sales agreement Exelon Power Exelon Generations power plant operat ion arm will assume operation of the plants The transaction includes a to lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe r during summer months for the next five years at marketbased rates Consi dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement it is presumed that TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the summer months of the fiveyear contract and then purchasing the electric o utput of the plants during that time Interestingly TXU is able to abide b y Texas requirement that it not own and control more than percent withi n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants However realisti cally TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants at least in the summer months during its fiveyear contract with Exelon T his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas

Californias Intrastate NaturalGas Pipelines By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Associated Press California state power regulators voted D ec to deregulate further the transmission of natural gas within Souther n California a decision hailed by the industry and derided by consumer adv ocates The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC voted to appr ove a proposal that allows Southern California Gas Co the nations larges t gas utility and San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE to sell space on th eir backbone transmission pipelines These pipelines carry natural gas fr om out of state to a smaller distribution system in California that then tr ansports it to homes businesses factories and power plants Analysis This controversial vote by the CPUC took place last week but has not received a great amount of industry analysis This is rather surprisin g because the vote carries enormous potential impact for the way in which n aturalgas capacity is bought and sold along pipelines owned by Southern Ca lifornia Gas Co and SDGE in the southern part of the state Considering t he fiasco that opening the states electric market became over the last yea r it is a risky move for Californias regulators to open a competitive mar ket for the right to transport gas along these pipelines at this time even though the issue has been under debate at the commission for years Howeve r the rationale for the decision is that the new system will allow custome rs to better control the point from which their naturalgas supply originat es which theoretically should lower costs and preserve space along the pip elines that the customers dont need Critics of the plan especially The U tility Reform Network TURN say that allowing competition along the natur algas pipelines in California could allow fewer companies to control most of the pipeline space which could in fact cause the opposite of the intend ed effect and drive up energy costs A case that has been used by both side s of the debate is that of El Paso Corp which found itself in a lengthy l awsuit this year when it was charged with giving preferential access to its pipeline to one of its affiliates which allegedly played a role in drivin g up energy costs in the state Before analyzing the potential impact of the CPUCs ruling lets first est ablish specifically what the ruling entails and some background of the comp anies involved Put into a nutshell the ruling creates a competitive marke t for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owne d by Southern California Gas and SDGE which are both subsidiaries of San Diegobased Sempra Energy NYSE SRE As noted Southern California Gas is ranked as the largest naturalgas distribution utility in the country and serves a territory of squaremiles that ranges from central Californ ia to the Mexican border Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines i ncluding the ones that transport power into California both of these compa nies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their intrastate backbone pipelines giving customers firm transportation right s on the pipelines The pipelines are referred to as backbone because the y are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to fact ories and power plants along with homes and businesses It is important t o note that the CPUCs ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas i n California which includes electric generating plants Residential and sm all business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated gastransmission costs Under the new auction system power producers and industrial naturalgas cu stomers of the two companies will bid to buy pipeline space with preferenc e being given to those bidders that intend to reserve space for the longest period of time According to the CPUC the ruling creates three tiers of accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines The first tier includes re sidential and small business customers who are not included in the new com petition and will automatically have about million cubic feet per day of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use The second tier inclu des industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competi tion and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity The thi rd tier includes all other market participants including naturalgas marke ters which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left Both South ern California Gas and SDGE reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the end of for their largest customers to transport natural gas The aucti ons will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the b idding process As one option bidders can pay a fixed price of cents p er million British thermal units MMBtu that would cover all of the capaci ty on the pipeline that they have reserved regardless if it is ultimately used or not As a second option bidders can pay for only percent of the reserved capacity at the fixed price of cents per MMBtu and percen t at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately use In addition the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space an i mportant point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control o ver the pipeline than allotted in the ruling As noted the measure passed the CPUC in a vote The ruling will remain in place until at which time the commission can decide to renew it The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas Henr y Duque and Geoffrey Brown Loretta Lynch president of the CPUC and Carl Wood voted against the measure Wood said he opposed the measure because it was based on data accumulated before naturalgas prices dramatically incre ased during the winter of Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure wa s a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to ke ep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using inte rstate pipelines which are not regulated by the CPUC An exodus among indu strial users from intrastate pipelines according to the three commissioner s could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs a ssociated with maintaining the pipelines However regulators were quick to qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cos t of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total deregulation Instead the commissioners said that the ruling simply amount s to less regulation As I mentioned the case against El Paso Corp NYSE EPG was used as an e xample to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among the naturalgas intrastate pipelines The case against El Paso Corp is a v ery complicated one but it essentially comes down to one core issue The c ase revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November El Paso improperly shared marketsensitive information with one of its affiliates which drove up naturalgas prices preempted competition from nonaffiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range of billion for Californians El Paso Corp has consistently maintaine d that it engaged in no wrongdoing According to a report issued by the sta te Assembly naturalgas prices in California increased from billion i n to billion in to billion for only the first three mo nths of In October El Paso Corp was absolved of the charges of mani pulating naturalgas prices in California but an investigation continues r egarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates The releva nce of this case is that those opposed to opening up Californias intrastat e pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company t o step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be ab le to drive up price Those in favor of the CPUCs new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso case are unfounded For starters the ruling restricts companies from ownin g more than percent of the pipeline which theoretically should prevent a company from gaining an ability to control prices Critics however say that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space which could poten tially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than percent of pipeline capacity The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of t he remaining questions that only time will be able to answer Critics of th e ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the naturalgas pipeli nes creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the states electri city market which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulati on In other words TURN argues the CPUC ruling opens the door for one com pany to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along the intrastate gas pipelines thereby giving that company the opportunity t o control prices As the new ruling wont take effect until another year wh en Southern California Gas and SDGE begin receiving bids for capacity spac e on their pipelines we wont know any time soon if prices will be impacte d However critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in Californ ia during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indica tor of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energ y prices Moreover the opening of competition along capacity space on Californias i ntrastate naturalgas pipelines is a surprising departure from the states discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector It is too early to tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices and of course this ques tion is the source of great debate with one side saying that prices will d rop and the other side saying that prices will increase Perhaps the large r issue however is the control over the states pipelines that could be i mpacted by this ruling Even percent capacity control the amount that t he CPUC is opening to competition would be considered excessive by some ot her states For instance in Texas percent control is considered a maxim um standard Again whether or not the allowance of competition will spark the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that remains to be seen We do know that electric competition in California bec ame a disastrous experiment but even with this history the state is moving forward with bringing competition to its intrastate naturalgas pipelines An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one o f New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have enough megawatts t o support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure The report challenges a market appraisal by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO which has run the states wholesale power market since The NYSEG report titled New York States Electr ic Energy Crisis and NYSEGs Comprehensive Solution criticizes the NYISO fo r not giving power consumers price certainty in the transition from local monopolies to an open competitive market Analysis New York can now officially be added to the list of troubled ener gy markets as market projections and fundamental structural problems spell ou t an alarming prognosis for the state as it heads into the summer season However unlike California which basically faces a power supply problem th at can be improved over time New York arguably suffers from a more severe and permanent set of conditions that cannot be easily resolved Like its West Coast counterpart New York also suffers from a supply demand imbalance a nd local resistance that thwarts new generation development However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin ue to take their own toll on the stability of the market Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o n each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe r As noted in its new report NYSEG a subsidiary of Energy East NYSE EAS is especially critical of NYISO which it says has contributed to soaring wholesale prices in New York NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining unrealistic goals for new power supply not providing accurate price signal s to energy customers and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems Yet beyond the finger pointing some essential facts can be established o n which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree According to data included in the NYISO report between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generating capacity under contract in the state increased only by MW New York has not brought a new plant online sin ce when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven year s since a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate In addition New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks Deficie nt transmission systems in central New York around New York City and at the outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than can be imported into the state New York City is relatively isolated from t he transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o n citybased power supply New York Citys load should reach MW this summer alone requiring MW of incity capacity along with imports t o meet demand and provide a reserve margin With a current capacity of MW there is a potential MW shortfall These projections presume normal weather conditions If New York experiences a warmerthannormal summer th e outlook gets even worse Further according to a report from New Yorks State Attorney General between and capital improvements to New Yorks transmission syste m dropped from million per year to million per year At the presen t time only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is scheduled A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut would provide Long Island with about MW of additional power and increas e its import capacity by about percent Unless this transmission expansion is expedited it is not scheduled for operation until Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York most certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th e use of air conditioners pushing demand to annual highs While NYSEG and th e NYISO may agree on the nature of New Yorks problems a contentious debate has emerged with regard to finding a solution In its own proposal release d in early March the NYISO focused on building new generation expediting siting processes improving transmission lines and conservation efforts I n one of its key proposals the NYISO urged the creation of MW of new electricity roughly percent of New Yorks peak demand by with up to MW of that generation being made available by the end of NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for falling short in its assessment o f the magnitude of the crisis and issued its own proposals in its recent report For instance NYSEG officials said that NYISO had grossly oversimplified the situation and that considering the tenuous state of power construction in New York the objective of establishing MW by was extremely unrealistic In turn NYSEG says that a robust wholesa le electric market will not materialize in New York until assuming that measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately In earl y March NYSEG released the NYSEGPlan outlining six steps which it believe s contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition to a competitive market in New York In summary the NYSEGPlan includes Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants Adding to the states transmission capacity Adding to the states naturalgas supply infrastructure Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers by encouraging interruptible load where feasible and building the technological infrastructure necessary for realtime pricing Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan in which electric rates would be frozen for seven years by July However while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals the same obstacles inherent in New Yorks market might also thwart its own ener gy plan For instance topping the list of NYSEGs six steps is an emphasis on establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and approval process This may be easier said than done As I mentioned in my IssueAlert the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th e lobbying force that community groups in California wield In that column I discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in Ramapo NY from an MW combinedcycle facility to a MW peaking unit due to opposition raised by local residents In addition just yesterday a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort s by the New York Power Authority NYPA to build two MW gasfired generators in the borough of Queens The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to cease all construction on the units and ruled that the power authority violated state environmentalreview laws to its efforts to rush the plant into service by June In response NYPA has said that the plantsalong w ith nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York Cityare need ed to prevent power outages this summer NYPA continues to face fierce opposition from community groups many of them launching lawsuits who do not want the generation units in their neighborhoods Consequently the supply demand imbalance in New York is a very serious matter and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless blackouts occur Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines surrounding New York State and New York City are solved adding new power supply assuming that generation development can move past community opposition would not be enough to bring more balance to the market In the interim conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c an user to abate power outages this summer but again the general public may n ot fully understand the need to reduce their power usage New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for nearterm problems First expedite the building of new generation sources including distribution generation alternatives This assumes that gas lines will be sufficient to import necessary fuel Second allow the economy of New York City to stagnate as a result of the supply demand imbalance which will drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand And third focu s on conservation efforts which again may not work until residents are directly impacted by outages The city may choose a combination of all thre e approaches or decide to focus on just one However to address the immediat e concerns it does not appear that New York has any options besides this threetier approach One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne w York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture Although it is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated divestiture utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur e to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most of their power plants NYSEG the author of the new report on New Yorks power problems is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will remain only in the transmission business This most likely creates a heightened sensitivity on NYSEGs part with regard to the power supply shortages presently facing New York Again we now have two states that represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility model becomes dismantled Of course it is not fair to say that divestiture is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York but taking away a utilitys ability to effectively control is own power supply costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and

Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Powergen of the United Kingdom and LGE Energy Corp of Louisville Ky have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations LGE will maintain its headquarters in Louisville which will serve as the headquarters for Powergens North American operations LGE Energys utility subsidiarie s Louisville Gas Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company will continue as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with headquarters in Louisville and Lexington Ky respectively ANALYSIS Although referred to as a merger Powergen actually has acquire d LGE a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all three core sectors of the electric utility business generation transmissi on and distribution Powergen which generates about percent of the electricity used in England and Wales is a company with clear intentions to expand internationally The company currently has electric and gas operations in Europe India Asia and Australia Together the Powergen LGE combination reportedly will have assets of nearly billion and total revenues of billion serving four million customers worldwide The partnership marks the third acquisition of a US electric utility by a foreign company following ScottishPowers purchase of PacifiCorp and National Grids purchase of the New England Electric System NEES both in It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition of a US utility the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have become easier to pass Powergens reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise from needs similar to its UK counterparts In the last ten years that have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of electricity in the United Kingdom the electric sector has become completely competitiv e in all areas including domestic customers Just as in US deregulation concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of UK companies which is compounded by the limited size of the UK energy marke t Consequently companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through opportunities abroad Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the US market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan ies in this country including Cinergy and Houston Industries now Reliant which all fizzled LGE is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the UK companys desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market LGE should be a good partner for Powergen as the latter gains access to approximately million customers In addition LGE owns equity in and operates nonutility power plants in six states as well as in Spain owns interest in three naturalgas distribution companies in Argentina and owns CRCEvans Pipelin e International a provider of specialty equipment to the naturalgas and oil pipeline construction industry Altogether LGEs two utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about billion in assets which should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind Perhaps Powergens primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan y values LGEs comparatively lowcost power production and high standards regarding reliability and customer service Yesterday Dec marked LGE Energys last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange Shareholders on record should receive letters of transmittal from Powergens paying agent Computershare Trust Company of New York containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the agreedupon cash payment of per share An additional payment of per share will also be paid to LGE Energy shareholders on record as of Dec Powergen reportedly paid about billion for LGE and assumed an additional billion in LGE debt During the merger process there was a lot of speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LGE despit e its disclosure of divesting key assetssuch as overseas interests its metering business and two UK power stationsto generate liquid capital During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition Standard Poors kept Powergens debt position under scrutiny although its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any significant downgrades in its ratings Moving forward it will be interesti ng to see how the companys rating changes now that the acquisition has been completed We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of US utilities and all are still fairly newso consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu re of two foreign corporate cultures will work As an example of difficulties that Powergen might face ScottishPower encountered a multitude of difficulties assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of PacifiCorp In addition although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have claimed that they intend to become major players in the US markets throug h their acquisitions of US companies that has yet to materialize Where the combined company goes from here is unknown It is possible that Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed that this will be a key area of expansion Another possible strategy is developing its telecom business Powergen announced its move into the UK telecommunications sector earlier this year Powergens joint venture with Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc ts and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with multiutility billing solutions Thus speculation has been raised that the company may develop this area of its business in the United States as well It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa ny attempts an acquisition of a US utility Consequently many eyes will remain on the Powergen LGE combination as it should be a good indicator of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants Match for Entergy in New York By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced that Constellation Nuclear will buy percent of Unit and percent of Unit Constellation will own a total of MW of Nine Mile Points MW of total generating capacity The total purchase price including fuel is million The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the Nuclea r Regulatory Commission NRC and the New York Public Utilities Commission still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase but Constellation Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid ANALYSIS This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever al reasons First the purchase of the plants expands Constellations generati on assets which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the last year Secondly the location of the plants is a critical factor Constellation has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region and New York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing field for nuclear assets Third owning the Nine Mile Point plants will elevate Constellations stature moving it ever close to become on par with its nearest competitor in the New York market Entergy Corp Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move for Constellation Nuclear let me establish some of the important factors of the deal Nine Mile Point is a twounit boiling water reactor site Nine Mile began producing electricity in Nine Mile began producin g electricity in The two units are both located in Scriba NY which is about miles north of Syracuse The Nine Mile Point units have had rather spotty histories but over the last two years have shown signs of becoming strong performers Niagara Mohawk operates both units Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several different utility owners Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of Unit Unit is owned by a group of coowners Niagara Mohawk percent New York State Electric Gas percent Rochester Gas Electric Corporation percent and Central Hudson Gas Electric Corporation percent It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase percent of Unit because the Long Island Power Authority an additional coowner that controls percent of Unit has opted not to sell its share of the plant at this time The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market value of their plants through an open competitive process This is part of an overall effort to separate generation transmission and distribution activities within the state With that established I will continue to support my case that the acquisit ion of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energys growth strategy In early Constellation began a restructuring of its corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclea r and the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of and the company is committed to expanding this growth The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over MW of electric generation facilities by Toward that end Constellatio n Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest their generation plants Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group a unit within Constellation Nuclear was established when Baltimore Gas Electric another Constellation Energy subsidiary created a new area for its lifecycle license renewal activities Thus most likely Constellat ion will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units and has a core group of people with expertise in this area License renewal s in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC so there shoul d not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process The only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe nt in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC Presently Constellations generation assets are based in a mixture of coal and nuclear The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the foreseeable future buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases Thus Constellation could be in a prime position if the desire for nucleargenerated power continues to rise as the company anticipates While Constellation will most likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company is clearly moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio Constellation has justified its move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are quite robust once they are calculated out A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea ses is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a year contract to provide electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices Specific terms of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell percent of its share of the Nine Mile Point plants output back to the sellers at an avera ge price of nearly MWh until This alone should provide a solid rate of return for Constellations merchant energy business In addition as I indicated the New York location is key factor in this deal Aside from its large population the state of New York is home to a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently For these two reasons alone New York stands out as the center within Constellations focus on the Northeastern United States Yet Constellations competitors also have the same plan and have all fought to gain assets in the region Just within the last few months Entergy Corpwhich also has based its strategy to a large extent on nuclearhas been aggressively making its own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State In fact Entergy was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders for the Nine Mile Point plants I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor d an Entergy spokesperson back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was actively attempting to purchase the two plants However despite the loss of the two Nine Mile Point plants Entergy retains a very strong nuclear presence in New York In late November Entergy closed the sale on the New York Power Authoritys two nuclear power plants Indian Point Unit in Westchester County and the James A Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County In fact the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest acquisition to date in Entergys nuclear strategy and also represented the highest purchase price million ever of a nuclear asset Earlier in the same month Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point plant from Con Edison Altogether Entergy now controls over MW of nuclear generatio n in the state of New York Consequently since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of the top nuclear power producers in the industry it will need to match Entergy along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke with regard to its nuclear portfolio There is only a limited number of nuclear plants that will become available for purchase and thus any acquisition of an operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in this particular market As a sidenote I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants percent of Unit and percent of Unit It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir ed by National Grid a UK company that is considered one of the worlds largest independent transmission companies The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk is supporting National Grids strategy of becoming a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of the US energy industry Generation is not a high priority for National Grid and the sale of Niagar a Mohawks nuclear assets resulted from this strategy Moreover once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawks current strategy it is a key component for Constellation Energy There are certainly risks associated with both approaches but the bottom line on this deal from my perspective is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets in a strong market Its pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be a contender in the nuclear arena especially in New York and owning the two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert December LADWP Continues to Shine Despite Californias Dark Period By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California Independent System Operator CalISO on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency for the second consecutive day The CalISO is calling on all California electricity customers to increase their energyconservation efforts and urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after pm Responsib le for the reliability of Californias electricity grid the CalISO declares a Stage One emergency when the states power reserves drop to percent In contrast the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP the municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area announced that its more than million businesses and residences are enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into the holiday season ANALYSIS What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman LADWPs genera l manager Just two years ago the municipal utilitythe largest cityowned utility in the United Stateswas ridden with massive debts and faced an uncertain future Now LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another Lets take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself from the California crisis Back in Freeman was brought on board at LADWP from the CalISO no less to essentially save what was thought to be a sinking ship Straddled with billion in debt the need to cut about jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident ial and industrial customers Freemans decision to take on the role of managin g LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP with an aggressive reorganization in mind including the primary goal of lowering rates and becoming debtfree by Early on Freeman made a critical decisionone that in hindsight appears to be flawlessfor LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the states th ree IOUs PGE SCE and SDGE continued down the treacherous path of restructuring While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means of averting market power issues due to agreements established with the CPUC LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State s electing to keep the integrated utility model In addition Freeman blocked ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWPs trading unit and thus maintained control over the munis generation assets Enter the summer of Californias discontent With demand on an unexpected increase and supplies in questionable availability LADWP found itself having the upper hand The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl y has favored generators and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand Critics accuse d LADWP of profiteering but Freeman contended that the utility was just taking advantage of Californias flawed market The truth is that LADWP was in the right place at the right time and maximized its ability to generate cash via power trading which it used to drive down its debt A shrewd move by any estimation The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season illustrated by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards Some report s indicate that LADWP earned about million just from surplus power over the course of the summer These profits only added to what LADWP had made in the previous year Fiscal year wholesale energy marketing and transmission services generated million which along with other sources of wholesal e revenue marked a growth of percent over The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped with the onset of cooler temperatures Ongoing structural problems within the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and warnings of sudden increases in prices As noted the state continues to face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has been forced off including a substantial amount from plants that had expire d air emissions credits A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwesta nother carry over problem from the summeralso has complicated the situation in California And while the state IOUs evaluate longterms contracts with energy provide rs based on todays high prices LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv e generation plan Among its objectives are to add MW of power generati on within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin The end result of this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant supply available at times of peak demand Also high on the list of Freeman s priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative energy sources Already demonstrating a good record for green power LADWP wants to cut its NOx emissions at its inbasin plants by percent by Toward that end just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte d for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los Angeles area The first kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver ed in the fourth quarter of and the second in the first quarter of A previously ordered kW fuel cell power plant announced last year is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of Along with having no worries about supply LADWP customers also can look forward to a percent rate reduction that should take effect by followed by a percent rate reduction that has been proposed for As criticism continues to mount against Californias competitive wholesale market it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free daily IssueAlert Let us know if we can help you with indepth

new survey at specialpagesMultiClientas p and contact Jon Brock at for more details IMAGE IMAGE October Private Investors Align to Upgrade Californias Path Project Causes New State Federal Conflicts By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from Reuters The federal government has reached a deal with a c oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo rnia under a million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state Construction on the socalled Path project which was announced by Ener gy Secretary Spencer Abraham will begin in the spring of and could be completed by as early as summer Analysis The California energy crisis which clearly subsided over the sum mer of due to new generation that came online in the state mild weath er patterns and conservation efforts is generally considered the result of a severe supply demand imbalance While this may be true what often get s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the statethe lines that actually transport power from point A to point Balso played a primar y role in creating the tremendous instability of Californias energy market This problem still persists today and as California heads into the winte r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing The Dep artment of Energy DOE has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to Californias main transmission line While this is a positive step the upgrade creates a new level of state federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th e hands of private companies which creates a whole new set of potential co nflicts Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path upgrade there a re some things that we know for sure First Path which is owned by Pac ific Gas Electric Co is a mile highvoltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif ornia During the peak of the energy crisis in California Path became r ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks points at which transmission c ould not transport high volumes of power This preempted any transport of power from Southern California and Arizona and Mexico to the north whic h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor nia cities As noted these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand which is obviously a concern as w inter approaches The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat es energy market Ironically power supply is no longer seen as an imminen t problem New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou ld have operating reserves of between and MW this winter which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season However the report on the states transmission system is n ot as positive If the Northwest continues to experience a drought then No rthern California will still need to import more power from the south Heav y dependence on the strained Path could once again cause reliability pro blems for California Thus deficiencies along Path can be seen as a symptom of larger problem s that continue to plague California and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months if not years In fact there is a history here that is worth noting especially as it relates to f ederal state jurisdiction When President Bush released his national ener gy plan in April of this year he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path Following through with this order Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo nses from companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path The current contract which will add a new line to the existing Path is the result of that previous directive At present it appears that PGCorp NYSE PCG the parent of Pacific Gas Electric Co and six other companies have signed on to financially supp ort the upgrade The six other companies that will spearhead the project ar e the Transmission Agency of Northern California TransElect Inc Kinder Morgan Power Co PGNational Energy Group Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA a federal agency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in western st ates and operates miles of transmission lines Presently Path connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t he states largest generation facilitiesPacific Gas Electric Cos Diabl o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energys Morro Bay naturalgas power pla nt The upgrade will reportedly include a new kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about MW from these two plants Further when t he upgrade is finished in Path should be able to carry a total of MW of power Of course the first question that I asked was Who is going to pay for the upgrade The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line The rema ining percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade The exact percentages of i nvestment and ownership have yet to be defined but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next days You may ask why these comp anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California Th e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr ough fees charged to use the new transmission line This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project who presumably ant icipate that California will remain a highdemand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported As I mentioned there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th is upgrade plan First there is the issue of potential state federal reg ulatory conflicts Presently state governments have jurisdiction over powe r line siting Thus the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path prior to Secretary A brahams call for privatecompany bids Specifically the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas Electric Co which it regulates to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path As seems to be a growing occurrence we may find that there is a state federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali fornia Gov Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t he states prerogative and have issued strong criticisms over the DOEs ve nture into this territory However in his energy plan President Bush seem ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca pacity If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE it is n ot known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area In an y event representatives from TransElect one of the participating compani es have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state and public and private interests will be one of the key challenges for th e upgrade project Note that TransElect was the company that had unsuccess fully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California Edison earlier this year Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOEs upgrade plan for Path are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of Californias transmission grid The DOEsponsored upgrade u nlike the one that the CPUC has directed reportedly would not be subject t o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC Further bec ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n ew line these companies will be able to charge tolls to the power market ers that use the lines to transport power This is most likely a point of c ontention for California officials especially Gov Gray Davis who has sou ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p rivatecompany ownership of generation facilities in the state The positiv e side of this issue is that according to the DOE the bids from private c ontracts enable the upgrade of Path to proceed without any increase to either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am erica As a side note in addition to Path the CPUC is also proceeding with a n ew transmission line in Southern California known as the ValleyRainbow In terconnect transmission line Although the timetable has been delayed until San Diego Gas Electric is proceeding with a volt transmiss ion line that would connect Southern California Edisons Valley Substation near Romoland Calif with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo w Calif area just south of the RiversideSan Diego county line The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDGEs an d SCEs transmission systems The first interconnection is at the San Onofr e Substation near San Clemente Calif The project is designed to deliver a pproximately MW Moreover the expansion of Path is a necessary step to help California l ower its risk for further reliability problems Due to generation developme nt the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors The state government still has its hand in power purchases which represe nts a huge part of the states energy market The state has accrued b illion in debt to buy power for the states utilities the recovery for whi ch remains an unresolved issue While Gov Davis has preferred to increase the states role in Californias energy infrastructure this new DOEsponso red project on Path puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies An archive list of

Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from Reuters Software company Caminus Corp Nasdaq CAMZ anno unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C orp Caminus said it would swap shares of its stock and pay milli on cash for Altras software business That values the deal at about mi llion based on Caminus closing price of on Oct Analysis The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry particularly impacting thos e companies that are involved in the trading sector On their own both com panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche Now that Caminus is acquiring Altras software suite which is primarily focused on the naturalgas trading sector the synergy between the two comp anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading Essentially Altra has two core businessesan energy tr ading exchange and a software business Caminus has entered into an agreeme nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio ns Together the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges Lets first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create U p to the point of this partnership Caminus and Altra were not considered d irectline competitors as Caminus business model focused on risk manageme nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions However there we re components of the companies businesses that certainly overlapped Camin us Corp has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline TradeSpark Ho ustonStreet etc Altras software which is used in the same energy tradin g portals focuses on naturalgas transactions Headquartered in New York Caminus which went public a year ago is a prov ider of software solutions and consulting services that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat ed with energy trading Toward that end the company offers two software pa ckages ZaiNet software solutions which enables energy organizations to effectiv ely trade and manage energy transactions ZaiNet has been designed to add ress a wide range of energy commodities traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and thirdparty s ystems Nucleus software systems which were designed specifically to meet the trad ing risk management scheduling and accounting needs of utilities genera ting companies power pools gas and oil producers processors pipelines and other energy market participants In other words the Caminus Nucleus s ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize track and manage thei r various energy transactions from generation to enduser delivery One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an d market positions in realtime and consequently determine acceptable risk levels Recently Caminus added the Storefront product which is a Webbased tradin g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet Also just t his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston Caminus unveiled a new so ftware product known as FrontOffice which gives traders of energy physica ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction According to company r eports approximately percent of Caminus revenue comes from software li cense sales In addition Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse s on risk management services for energy clients One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel y is its efforts along with other software companies to establish a commo n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra nsaction risk management systems A few months ago Caminus established t he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet and has since generat ed interest in some companies to participate and help create universal s tandards for energy trading One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro tocol for energy trading platforms The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions In September Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp w hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions Un der the partnership Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing transaction trading and risk management systems to create what they are calling a St raightThrough Processing STP environment for vertically integrated ener gy companies By comparison Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry Altra re portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d irect access load generation dispatch regional transmission organization RTO connectivity integrated OASIS reservations and North American Elect ric Reliability Council NERC checkout and billing Altra boasts a custome r list of about clients mostly in the gas sector but also including po wer and multifuel companies Altras software product suite includes trans action management tools known as Altra Gas Altra Power Altra Pipeline and Altra Web which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity According to Caminus the value of acquiring Altras software suite is to c reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga s and power traders Further the exchange of customers should benefit both companies Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s ervices to Altras customer base and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altras new generation of systems to Caminus customers The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp In fact Cam inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently explo ding According to Caminus CEO David Stoner the global market for wholesa le energy trading which consists of the European market is six to eight t imes the size of retail markets Consequently a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user In terestingly about to percent of the companies to which Caminus has p rovided risk management consulting services are US companies attempting t o expand in the European wholesale trading market Caminus consultants help ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA for the British go vernment due to be implemented by the end of or early Although smaller than the US market Britain has been experiencing privatization a nd various levels of deregulation since providing valuable experience and depth Besides the UK Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy Spain Holland Belgium Germany and the Nordic countries through N ORDPOOL Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently when fallou t from the events of Sept began to impact the companys business For Q Caminus reported that its total revenues increased percent to million compared to million for Q Specifically revenues from the companys software license fees increased percent to milli on during the same quarter However for Q Caminus lost or cents a share on revenue of million due primarily to the fact so me license sales that were expected to close did not Specifically Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter Given the impact that the events of Sept ha d on many companies a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke d as scheduled Moving forward Caminus says that the addition of Altras software should r esult in an increase of its revenue guidance by about percent Cami nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its Q earnings to cents a share compared with a previous estimate of cents a share al though analysts are still projecting cents a share for the fourth quarte r Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions However with these opportunities come considerable risks Hence creating this balance between risk and opp ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a nd Altra operate However the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive Every month new competitors in this space emerge so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list However so me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam inus Altra are Allegro Development KWI and SolArc to name just a few Moreover competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state The whole sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret ail market and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol esale market before it reaches the end user Thus consolidation within the energytrading software space should continue and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings Clarification Statement to IssueAlert on Dynegy In its Q ea rnings statement Dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and d istribution company Illinois Power was million versus million in Q In the column we incorrectly stated that Illinois Power had taken a loss of million The loss of million was reported by Dynegy s

extraordinary meeting set for Oct clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES Analysis AES expansion in Latin Americas telecommunications market was a lways seen as a risky move and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi g bite out of the companys strategy CANTV which was an appealing takeove r target for AES due to its longstanding monopoly over the telecom market in Venezuela has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications NYSE VZ which holds a percent stake in the company Verizon came out in support of the percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV whic h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES efforts to gain c ontrol over the company The repurchase could be seen as a power play with Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV which many analysts m ight see as a more appropriate synergy However this story also highlights the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ a especially since CANTVs resistance comes on the heels of AES pulling o ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador For background it is important to note that AES already owns percent o f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas Venezuel as largest private electricity company Thus the takeover effort is an at tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from Verizon CANTV which was privatized a decade ago is a fullservice telec ommunications provider offering switched and local domestic and internatio nal longdistance service throughout Venezuela Company CANTV also offers m obile cellular services wireless services Internet access and other value added services and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nation al network of public telephone lines CANTV became privatized about year s ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixedline telep hone service in Venezuela The company has a market capitalization of billion AES had bid in cash for each of the million USlisted shares in CANTV and in cash for each of the million shares of CANTV traded in Venezuela AES offer for CANTVs American shares represents a perc ent premium over CANTVs closing price of on Aug the time at wh ich the takeover effort was launched From the start of the offer some cri tics charged that this bid was too low but AES has maintained that the off er is fair AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTVs mobile services which account for about a quarter of the companys revenues and distribute the proceeds to shareholders CANTV was never very receptive to AES bid and did consider it to be a hos tile takeover In fact workers representatives at CANTV circulated a stat ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES stating that the deal would s everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers CANTV employees hold a per cent interest in the company Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock Note that CANTV wil l most likely issue the buyback program at compared to the that AE S had offered Thus the challenge for AES if it still wants to gain contr ol over CANTV will be to increase its already percent premium offer T he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi th its takeover attempt and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem pts AES rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw ofold in nature First AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil Chile and other countries Just this week AES announced its penetration of the A rgentina market by inking a million deal to purchase distribution and generation assets in that country from New Jerseybased Public Service Ente rprise Group PSEG In another recent announcement AES launched a cash te nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile a company that c onsists of MW of generation and kilometers of transmission In fa ct AES reportedly rivals Spains Endesa as the regions most dominant powe r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t hroughout Latin America Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni ted States Asia Europe and Latin America many investors now perceive th e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America which constitute s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou s Latin American countries However AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a million ta keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor Currently Edelnor which is one of the largest electrical generators in Chile is controlled by Mirant Corp one of AES direct competitors in the independent power producing market Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region Mirant has announc ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles s it can be assured of repayment AES did not give a reason for its decisio n to terminate the Edelnor takeover but one can surmise that investor reac tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor Further on Sept AES cut its earnings estimate for to a range of to per share from a previous range of to AES blam ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and US dollar lower UK power prices and the companys inability to replace earnings a nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant The drop in AES earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp any needed to purchase Edelnor AES shares were priced at prior to the earnings revision After the announcement at least as of early morning trading on Sept AES shares were priced at significantly down from the week high of whi ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago As of early morning trading on Oct AES shares were priced at Moreover investors did not react positively to AES plan to increase its s take in CANTV In fact after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug a day on which many stocks fell AES stock closed down or pe rcent to a month low of on the New York Stock Exchange AES CEO Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase did not represent a change of strategy for AES which he says will remain f ocused on power In addition Bakke noted that the purchase does not repres ent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Br azil and Bolivia Further Bakke clearly stated that AES is not going to a nnounce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world Nevertheless so me investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sec tor which is already significantly troubled and becoming too heavily entr enched in Latin America a market that is prone to political volatility On e investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date has not been terribly successful This coupled with the general market dow nturn for most companies with telecom exposure does not make for a good re cipe from an investors perspective at least as of today In fairness to AES penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver y strategic move from a longterm perspective With a population of mi llion Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r elated services In addition Venezuela is an assetrich country particula rly with regard to oil resources According to the Department of Energy Ve nezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil re serves of billion barrels plus billions of barrels of extraheavy oil a nd bitumen Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of US o il imports and is among the top crude oil producers in the world In add ition as noted AES investments in Latin America are not exclusively focus ed on Venezuela as the company also is present in Argentina Brazil Chile etc Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Lati n America and play a larger role in the drop in AES stock especially when we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time Only little more than a year ago the telecom sector was at its peak with bill ions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic ex pectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market Howeve r a massive downturn has ensued impacting not only companies operating in the telecom space but the nations entire economy as well The bottom of t he telecom sector has fallen out due in large part to the fact that the in crease in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand As Ive said before when analyzing this company the further that AES depar ts from its core strategy the more likely it is that we will continue to s ee volatility in the companys stock Up until these recent announcements AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses which were all equally important to its strategy power generation network delivery services and retail energy marketing Generation always appeared to be the main core of the companys business model as AES controls some facilit ies totaling over gigawatts of capacity worldwide This business model w orked well for AES and was well received by investors Any perceived deviat ion from this successful strategyespecially if it includes expansion into the dangerous territory of telecomcould mark a new and risky era for AES Nevertheless one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunit y that is worth exploring Latin America has low electrification and Intern et usage statistics Some analysts project high growth in the next to years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use which in t urn involves telecommunications The telecom industry is struggling at the moment Thus if one believes that telecom will make a comeback then buyin g now may make a wise strategy for those involved An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

IMAGE October Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from PR Newswire Conectiv NYSE CIV an energy provider locat ed in the MidAtlantic announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Atlanti c City Electric Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in t hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company The ownership interests were sold for approximately million excluding re imbursement of estimated fuel inventory subject to adjustment Analysis This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week but I di d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development The transfer of ownershi p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b ecause of its relation to Conectivs unique competitive strategy and the ro undrobin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat es Further despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation s nuclear facilities we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectivs owne rship in the plants which Conectiv shares with other companies who also h appen to be the buying partners in this sale The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows A percent interest MW in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U nits and sold in equal shares to coowners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon Pri or to the transaction PSEG Nuclear an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi ce Enterprise Group Incorporated and Exelon each owned about percent of the Peach Bottom plant Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit y A percent interest MW in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un its and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which prior to the sale owned about percent of the facility PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla nt A percent interest MW in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U nits and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which is the operator of the plant a nd prior to the sale owned percent of the facility As noted the significance of these transactions relates to Conectivs comp etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector Lets look at Conectiv first According to Conectivs President and COO Thomas Shaw the divestiture of t he nuclear assets is consistent with the companys focused business strateg y on two core energy businesses Conectiv Energy the companys integrated generation and asset optimization group and Conectiv Power Delivery the c ompanys regulated delivery business To support this twotiered focus Con ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t o expand a generation portfolio that includes only midmerit plants units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns Midmerit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant s and peaker units Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent a midmerit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent to percent From Conectivs perspective the value of the midmerit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op erate only when demand is comparatively high Further the company believes that midmerit units are ideally suited to support the companys energy tr ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of MW of bas eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power Light a subsidiary of Conect iv to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectivs telecommunications busi ness Conectiv Communications to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond Va for million In addition Conectiv sold its percent stake in a MW co generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP a nonut ility electric generator for million Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own ership of some MW of midmerit generation in the MidAtlantic region The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r epay debt and fund Conectivs development of additional midmerit assets C onectivs immediate goal is to build more than MW of midmerit power generation within the MidAtlantic region by Toward that end Conecti v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon ey to support a million MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S tation which is currently a MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur al gas The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge neration supports Conectivs strategy of refocusing on its core businesses which are power trading and wholesale marketing through midmerit units only and a regulated delivery business Conectiv Power Delivery provides e nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey Delaware M aryland and Virginia Given the fairly distinct line between Conectivs re gulated and unregulated businesses I have previously speculated that Conec tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand alone company a trend represented by AEP Reliant and UtiliCorp Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring so it is unlikely that any such sp in off of its generation business would take place in the near term Howeve r as far as I know Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e xclusively on midmerit plants Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco a partnership t hat is scheduled to close in April In this deal Pepco is acquiring Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at billion Both c ompanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date The partnership between these two relatively small and regiona lly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity delivery company in the MidAtlantic region By combining their two electri city delivery businesses Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doub le their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times In the nuclear sector it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con ectiv despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj ority ownership in the plants Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclearpower space and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li cense exchange on these three plants Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind ustry owning a total of reactors Earlier this year Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years and did not rule out the fact that his company migh t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility As noted PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente rprise Group Inc which in was split into PSEG a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power an unregulated US power generation company As noted PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek NJ and oversees PSEG Powers ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station located in Delta Pa When the Conectiv transaction is completed PSEG Power will own percent of Hope Creek percent of Salem and percent of Peach Bottom In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear Entergy Corp is another company th at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector Since Enter gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block Recently Entergy bought Con Edisons Indian Point Unit s and nuclear power plants in Westchester County NY In addition Ent ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat ion to purchase the MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon Vt for million With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale Enterg y will own a nuclear fleet that includes reactors Also note that the N ew York State Public Service Commission PSC just approved the sale of Nia gara Mohawks Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about million The purchase prices for the MW Nine Mile and percent of the MW Nine Mile are about million and mil lion respectively Constellation is another company that has consistently increased its nuclear power assets Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate d with coalfired generation many industry analysts have debated whether o r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence Exelon for example is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucl ear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR Supporters of PBM R believe its relatively small size MW anticipated short constructio n time months and cost kW can once again make nuclear power a n acceptable option In February of Exelon filed an application with the US nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the Uni ted States

Maps IMAGE IMAGE October NRC Approves Yucca Mountain as Nuclear Waste Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from Reuters The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC signed off on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevadas Yucca Mountain to hold radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants Yet another step in a lon g approval process the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by the Department of Energy DOE The Bush administration must still submit t hat plan for congressional approval The DOE in August gave a favorable saf ety assessment to the proposed project which may face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen Harry Reid of Nevada the new Senate assistant majority leader Analysis This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the na tions repository for spent nuclear fuel but the NRC approval of the site could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress Since Sept new secur ity issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washi ngton DC pause and support ongoing efforts to block the site Neverthel ess after a decade of study planning commissions and public debate the N RC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will side on the issue For background since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted be lief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioact ive materials is to store them deep underground From this starting point the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in and charged t he DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials coul d be stored From the beginning it was understood that the NRC would need to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional approval would also be necessary In the DOE selected nine locations in six states for consideration as possible depositories and at that time President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive s cientific study known as site characterization The three locations were Hanford Wash Deaf Smith County Texas and Yucca Mountain Nev In Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to onl y study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location based on the finding from th e earlier report In other words since that time no other location besides Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nucl ear waste in the United States The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear e nergy and weapons has become increasingly limited The Bush administration s national energy plan released last April demonstrated strong support fo r the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources Thus the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considera bly in the near future and the location of an acceptable repository has be come a top priority for the federal government What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location According to the vast amo unt of research compiled over the last decade there are several characteri stics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository sit e it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population miles from Las Vegas it is located in a very dry climate with less than six inches of water per year and the location offers an extremely deep w ater table to feet below the level of the potential repository In addition Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air Force Range and the Nevada Test Site where atomicbomb tests once took pl ace Thus it is considered a very secure area Based on these characterist ics over the last years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioact ive waste Under the evolving plan the site reportedly would store underground thousa nds of tons of radioactive materials from the nations nuclear plants for a n estimated years Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be us ed as the repository by but a delay in feasibility studies caused tha t date to be extended several times It is presently expected that assumin g the site gains all the necessary approvals Yucca Mountain would be used as a repository starting in However while scientists may have been generally in agreement reaching co nsensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult From a fe deral perspective President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository This belief has been sh ared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham However Nevada state leaders hav e demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the s torage of nuclear waste which has caused state federal conflicts for the last several years Specifically Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn and the Nevada A ttorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to usi ng Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire is sue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely considering the recent national events Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials In fact the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to is sue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate Nevada had gra nted water rights to the federal government but only for the study purpose s and not the actual use of the site The issue is still working itself thr ough various courts The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federa l court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized under federal law Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently out lined their concerns in public meetings Basically the top concern is that the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and in to the aboveground environment Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a fault line which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the po tential repository could be subject to shifting The location of Yucca Moun tain while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan has also bee n used by opponents as an argument against the plan Specifically opponent s say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor locate d about miles away and that a large number of military flights routine ly cross over the site In addition the events of Sept certainly have heightened concerns abou t potential targets for terrorist activity and despite reassurances from s cientists that the site is secure opponents believe that no site would be attackproof Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountai n The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsib le for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site because the transportation would be handled by private companies Critics of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the co untry The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the pre viously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca Mountain site All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will s ide with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and after n early two decades of study the pros of using this site outweigh the potent ial risks Regardless of the ultimate decision action on nuclear waste is necessary The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States However if we take the range of estima tes it would equate to a football field ranging from to feet deep T hat estimate takes into account all highlevel nuclear waste generated in t he United States since the start of a nuclear program in the s Compare d to other hazardous materials the amount of nuclear waste generated per y ear is very small In the United States all of the nuclear plants produce about tons of spent fuel a year whereas million tons of chemica l waste are generated per year Correction to IssueAlert on Dynegy vs Enron EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed billion in notional value The word

earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric Tlines in as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled i n that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale o f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Likewi se in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies Enro n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and u nlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional generati ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its m ost recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission En ron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint owner ships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o perating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lea dership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui ckly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten i nto the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too muc h too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red ucing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies Correction statement to IssueAlert on European trading According to a news report from Reuters the USowned EntergyKoch Tradin g was listed as a publicly traded company

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from Reuters USowned EntergyKoch Trading NYSE EKT is boo sting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands After a successful start we plan to subst antially increase our volume of European power power options and weather t rading next year said Uday Narang managing director of European trading EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in Fr ance and Austria although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Net herlands Analysis The announcement from EntergyKoch Trading that it will significa ntly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique In fact a recent scan of announcements from US power firms tells a similar story Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to stren gthen its European operations in an effort to replicate its strong US e nergy trading platform in Europe TXU said that it expects sharply higher profits this year from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent For the first nine months of TXU reportedly traded terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in con tinental Europe mostly in Germany which compared to terawatt hours in all of Further still UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity the fourthlarg est regional electric utility in the United Kingdom which in addition to miles of electric distribution lines owns a MW power plant The unrelated announcements have a common denominator US power firms are pl unging into the European energy trading market in droves despite some inhe rent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric compe tition among some European countries A new model in the United Kingdom kn own as the new energy trading agreement NETA rules appear to be facilita ting more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard acr oss the Continent The appeal of Europes power market for US energy companies is perhaps ob vious According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year de mand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to b e built an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT i n Texas In addition like other developed areas of the world Europes en ergy consumption has grown over the last two years US power firms who p erhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country have expanded operations in Europe where electric privatization i s occurring on a countrybycountry basis Consequently the companies ment ioned above join Williams Enron Duke AEP and Mirant to name a few wh ich have established London trading offices Moreover many of the US power firms that expand into Europe start by acc umulating generation assets in the United Kingdom as represented by the Ut iliCorp and Dynegy announcements Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early s and completed the process in May after Norway but well ahead of ot her European countries However there is a more important reason why US energy firms may be drawn to UK power trading and that is related to th e areas unique rules for energy transactions which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules it is important to fi rst understand the context of the European market as a whole and the tradin g system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this ye ar The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition Toward this end the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches allowing endusers the right to select an alternative provi der giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power sup pliers transmission and distribution network otherwise known as thirdpar ty access and the introduction of energy trading which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market This last point is significant because some of the European countries have dismantled previo usly integrated stateowned utilities and mandated the divestiture of gene ration assets At the end of approximately percent of the European Union EU e lectricity market was open to competition Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries at least those that a re open That is the good news However the basic problem with this appro ach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the t ransition to a fully competitive marketplace and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables For instance Germany is fully privatized while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide thirdpa rty access to competitors In practice this often means that one country m ay have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neig hboring country may have not developed any standards at all The other prob lem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient which makes it difficult to transport power across borders As a result wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneo us and lacking in comprehensive trading standards The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for thirdparty acce ss to the national grids on the Continent While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved the U nited Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more ef ficient market because it offers one grid system one balancing and settlem ent code and one contract format However even the power trading market i n the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start Up until March of th is year the UK power market operated under a pool auction system Unde r that model generation companies offered electricity for sale which was then pooled into an auction system where dayahead bids were made and power was sold in halfhour increments The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive marke t for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight However the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for m arket manipulation Given the concerns with the pool format the United Kin gdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October which culminated in the NETA model that started this year The key tenets that ma ke NETA different from the previous pool model are Forwards and futures markets which allow participants to form power sale d eals using standardized contracts either ontheday or several years in adv ance as opposed to only dayahead bids More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers c an negotiate bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the Unite d Kingdom A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co operating in a role similar to an ISO which facilitates the var ious transactions to ensure reliability The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand rep resented by individual meters and the threat of strict penalties for part icipants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity In a nutshell NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power tradi ng in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming The system i mprovements have been successful and more international power firms appare ntly believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kin gdom due to the NETA rules Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a percent increase in the number of contracts traded a perce nt drop in wholesale prices and a sixfold increase in the variety of produ cts offered As of early summer about new participants had regist ered to participate under the NETA system as compared with about under the former model As noted many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the C ontinent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale m arkets to competition In addition to the UKs model there are several a ctive trading exchanges in Europe presently although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive The Nord Pool with about members organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures market s The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about members and operates a s pot market for electrical power Smaller European exchanges offering both spot and futures contracts include the Switzerland Exchange and Germanys Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt In the meantime I think we will conti nue to see additional US power firms expanding into the

SCIENTECHs Issue sWatch IMAGE IMAGE October Enrons Departure from Core Business Takes a Toll on Performance By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGE News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE stock sustained further he avy losses on October as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years The energy giants stock was off or percent a t per share at midday trade on Oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a thirdquarter loss of mi llion As of early morning trading on Oct Enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new Securities and Ex change inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest ors Analysis Enrons first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa rture many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci I argued that the company is really struggling fro m a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leadi ng retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of cu stomers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases p rompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting fro m a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several o f the states in which the company operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and the companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available atwwwscientechcom We encourage our readers to

IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE November Updates on Enron Dynegy Mer ger SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Francisco By Will McNamara Direc tor Electric Industry Analysis Todays column includes analysis on three separate news items EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge News item from Energy Info Source Online energy trading EnronOnline will merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp agreed to a billion takeover by Dynegy Inc The integration of the two platforms w ill take about six to nine months Dynegy said In the meantime the two wi ll continue to operate separately On both EnronOnline and Dynegydirect tr aders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy respectively Analysis This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging integration of t he various businesses between Dynegy and Enron Although the merger makes s ense for both companies especially considering Enrons financial instabili ty and its limited options at this juncture it must be acknowledged that t he two companies have very different corporate cultures and the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task The companies hav e developed two distinct approaches to online trading as illustrated by th eir independent electronic exchanges Although it will be interesting to se e how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two sepa rate customer accounts one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegydirect have i n common is that they rely on principalbased transactions It is importa nt to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage when it developed E nronOnline the first electronictrading exchange well ahead of its compet itors Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydirect about a ye ar later The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has r ecorded transactions that exceed billion in notional value Since its inception in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notion al transactions Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnline led by el ectricity and natural gas but also including bandwidth and paper EnronOnl ine is a proprietary trading exchange In other words in every transaction that takes place on EnronOnline Enron participates as either a buyer or a seller Dynegydirect was launched in October a year after EnronOnl ine became operational Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline alth ough it is growing The exchange recorded nearly billion in transaction s in the third quarter Like EnronOnline Dynegydirect is also principalba sed In other words Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions ei ther as a buyer or a seller Unlike EnronOnline which is completely online Dynegydirect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy o ver the telephone It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved in two different kinds of online trading The first is the propri etary onetomany format on Dynegydirect in which Dynegy participates in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller The second venue is an anon ymous manytomany format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and sellers This operation takes place on TradeSpark Dynegy had p reviously invested million in eSpeed the trading systems developer tha t created the infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates As a whole th e online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a major growth spu rt A study conducted by AMR Research showed that energytrading exchan ges existed in April This number grew to by September A s eparate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that online tradin g in wholesale markets increased percent from to The same re port projects that online trading volume will continue to grow leaping fro m a billion market in to a trillion market in Without question the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a market edge in many sectors of the energy industry including the online trading market SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan News item from Energy Info So urce A federal judge on Nov refused to delay a settlement between South ern California Edison SCE and state regulators designed to allow the util ity to recover billion of its debts and to keep it from bankruptcy U S District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying the deal as requested by a cons umer group would risk harming the states secondlargest utility its cred itors and the public Judge Lew who approved the settlement on Oct cal led the arguments for a stay advanced by consumer group The Utility Reform Network TURN repetitive and without merit Analysis This is a vict ory for SCE in the painstaking process of establishing a rescue plan for th e utility with the state of California Two weeks ago a federal appeals co urt had temporarily blocked a settlement between SCE and state power regula tors that would keep electric rates at record highs for the next two years The th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN two weeks to argue agai nst the settlement The settlement would help SCE the states secondlarge st utility pay more than half of its estimated billion debt by continui ng to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed last May The judges de cision now has blocked any additional counter claims by TURN at least on t he current judicial level and it appears that SCE is free to move forward with its CPUCendorsed rescue plan It is important to note that the ori ginal settlement deal between SCE and the state of California emerged out o f negotiations that had taken place between SCE and the CPUC in an effort t o resolve previous litigation SCE had sued state regulators at the CPUC af ter they refused to allow the utility to raise rates and recover billions o f dollars it had spent buying power on behalf of customers at soaring price s in the wholesale market SCEs lawsuit argued that the regulators broke f ederal law and unconstitutionally took its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their electricity At the present time SCE s total debt is marked at about billion in power procurementrelated liabilities due to state law that prohibited it from recovering the high co sts of wholesale electricity through retail electric rates Under the agree ment reached between SCE and the CPUC SCE would be allowed to pay down abo ut billion of its back debt of billion In exchange for being pr otected from bankruptcy proceedings SCE agreed to a rate freeze and a prom ise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off SCEs rates were raised by approximately percent in a nd will remain frozen through unless the utility pays off its debts so oner In exchange SCE agreed it would use cash on hand and any revenue bey ond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts pay no dividends on its common stock through or until its back debts are fully paid and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC h ad violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the und erlying cost of wholesale power From its perspective officials at Edison International the parent company of SCE expressed confidence that the set tlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate enough cash and gain fin ancing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of to pay its debt to banks bondholders and power generators Tally of Absentee Ballots Chan ges San Francisco Municipalization Vote News item from Reuters Two ball ot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in San Francisco an d unplugging utility Pacific Gas Electric Co have gone down in defeat o fficials said on Nov Analysis The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov municipalization vote in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election As noted in a previous IssueAlert Proposition I which sought to set up a Municipal Utility District in San Francisco and n eighboring Brisbane was defeated However originally it was believed that the separate measure known as Proposition F which would have established a Municipal Water and Power Agency in San Francisco alone had passed by a slim margin Upon counting the absentee ballots the San Francisco Departme nt of Elections announced that this measure was defeated by a scant vot es Obviously Pacific Gas Electric Co is quite pleased with the rev ised outcome of this election In response to the finalized vote represent atives from the utility said This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentiment in favor of the takeover of PGEs distribution system in San Fr ancisco There may be some validity to this statement considering that on e could argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas Electric and the re cent California energy crisis conditions could have favored a promunicipa lization vote and yet the measure still failed However lets not forget that it was defeated by only votes which indicates that the issue rega rding the establishment of a public power system in the area is far from ov er The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be att ributed to several factors First it must be acknowledged that PGCorp t he parent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas Electric spent about millio n on advertising to defeat the measure However arguably voters responded to claims by Pacific Gas Electric Co that the municipalization plan was unrealistic The utility claimed that a MUD Municipal Utility would be il lequipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Ga s Electric has managed for years and that a cityrun bureaucracy would n ot be able to compete with big league energy players In addition the new MUD would have to purchase Pacific Gas Electrics transmission assets and also buy wholesale power without the benefit of longterm contracts which represent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom We encourage our readers to contact us with their c omments We look forward to

IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE November Dynegy and Enron Announce Mer ger By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item fro m Reuters Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN agreed on Nov to acquire rival Enron Corp NYSE ENE for some billion in stock underlining the dramatic r eversal of fortunes for the Houstonbased energy trading giant that was val ued last year at nearly billion Enrons stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by US regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating a gencies The merged company will retain the Dynegy name It will have annua l revenues of more than billion and assets worth billion includin g more than megawatts of electricity generating capacity and miles of naturalgas pipelines It will be North Americas biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity positions previously held by En ron Analysis Well its now official The announcement of what presumabl y will be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end of last week It is indeed a dramatic end Enron the maverick and inn ovative company that has often been credited for literally creating deregul ated markets in the energy industry will no longer exist after what has be en a very quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several mont hs Dynegy the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional ap proach toward success is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and locking in much of the industry market share of Enron Can there be an y doubt that this is the energy industrys manifestation of the tortoise an d the hare parable Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy but is makin g a smart choice to be bought considering its desperate circumstances and the unlikelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own For Dynegy this acquisition is a major win as the combination will create the bigg est and strongest energy merchant in the world There are so many interes ting dimensions to this mammoth deal Before addressing some issues related to the approval of the deal lets establish some of the key points of the merger agreement There have been some mixed reports but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about a share quite a steal c onsidering that just over a year ago Enron was trading at close to a sh are and had a market value of nearly billion Under terms of the agreem ent Enron shareholders will receive Dynegy shares per share of Enro n common stock Dynegys current stockholders including ChevronTexaco Corp which currently owns percent of Dynegy will own approximately per cent of the combined company while Enrons stockholders will own approxima tely percent of the combined companys stock at closing In addition Dynegy will provide an immediate billion assetbacked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by Chevro nTexaco Chuck Watson chairman and CEO of Dynegy will retain his position at the new company Steve Bergstrom president of Dynegy and Rob Doty ch ief financial officer will retain their positions at the new company It i s not presently known what role if any Ken Lay current CEO of Enron wil l hold at the new company Of course this acquisition could not have tak en place if Enron had not fallen into a very vulnerable spot this year Qui te literally Enron was pushed into this deal because it was running out of cash its stock had tanked and its credit ratings were slashed to near jun k levels all within the last several weeks Enrons decline over the cours e of has been the result of losses in its telecom sector losses from its involvement in India the departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling a Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigation into some of its business practices and lack of investor confidence about Enrons honesty i n its financial reporting This last point gained validity last week when E nron announced that it had overstated earnings by percent over the last four years and investors should disregard the companys financial statement s from through the first half of The restating of its earnings f or the last five years sliced million from Enrons reported profits I n addition Enron revised its debt upward in each year from to A t the end of Enrons debt was billion million more than it had previously reported By not reporting this debt earlier Enron presu mably was able to maintain a stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been disclosed The key value for Dynegy in this acq uisition is Enrons successful energy trading business In addition Dynegy could also find synergies in Enrons retail unit Enron Energy Services an d EnronOnline the companys electronic trading unit Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect which was launched after Enron gained t he firststrike advantage in this market space Details are still emerging but it would make sense if Dynegy opted to not purchase other units under Enrons business structure such as the companys water and telecom busines ses which are losing money Dynegy has its own telecom unit which has als o lost money this year so it may not want to expand in this slowgrowing s ector at this time Vivendi Environnement a French company that has expand ed into various lines of business has reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix Enrons struggling water subsidiary Not e that Enron sold Azurix North America to American Water Works The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dynegy and E nron shareholders Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent upon any p ossible downgrades on its longterm debt that Dynegy could encounter with t he purchase of Enron At this juncture it does not appear that Dynegy will be downgraded but this is a fastchanging story and conditions could chan ge abruptly Financing the deal may also be an issue even with the infusio n of capital from ChevronTexaco Dynegy reportedly has billion worth of debt and has a market capitalization of billion Thus Enrons own mo re substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb a concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal This issue could be he lped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enrons assets and if there is some repair work done on Enrons balance sheets The issue of regulato ry approval could be difficult as the combination of the two huge companie s may cause regulators to be concerned about market power and antitrust iss ues The review of this merger will be unprecedented considering that the wholesale naturalgas and electricity trading market is still fairly young Certainly a deal of this magnitude has not previously occurred in the der egulating energy industry It is not presently clear which regulatory agenc y will be involved in the review although the Federal Energy Regulatory Co mmission FERC the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department co uld all be involved FERC would most likely become involved only if the acq uisition includes the transfer of a physical asset such as a pipeline FER C may not become involved if the deal is structured solely as an exchange o f stock Not involving FERC would be more advantageous for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly shorter An issue th at most likely will be at the top of the list of review items for regulator s would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dynegy would ho ld market power in the naturalgas trading space which could preempt mark et entry by other competitors The combined company would be considerably l arger than its nearest competitors Scope and scale are considered the top competitive assets in the trading sector and the combination of Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance It will fall on regul ators to determine if the combined company is so large that it precludes ot her competitors from emerging into the same space To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatement The two rival com panies followed very different paths to success Enron under the leadershi p of Jeffrey Skilling in particular espoused an unorthodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order to achieve success in the energytrading space Dynegy on the other hand approached the market from the opposite perspective and diligently acquired diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally to support its trading operation Up until the start of it appeared that Enrons strategy wa s the more successful of the two Enron with billion in revenues and billion in profits in ranked fifth on Fortune s list of larges t US companies In contrast Dynegy ranked on the same list and had billion in revenues and million in earnings However turned ou t to be Dynegys year and the success continued into the very year th at would bring Enrons downfall Enrons problems culminated in millio n in losses in the third quarter after taking billion in charges ass ociated with several of its noncore businesses Taken with the other facto rs plaguing the company Enron became exceptionally vulnerable and prone to a takeover which has now provided Dynegy with a strong gain The purcha se of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegys size and should immediately p rovide an accretive earnings contribution Further Dynegy claims that it e xpects a to percent annual earnings growth over the next three years following its planned acquisition of Enron If it gains all of the necessa ry regulatory approvals Dynegy will become the undisputed market leader in the energy industry with annual revenues of billion and billion in assets The company will have MW of generating capacity which mo ves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating MW by In other words the combined company will dwarf any other competi tion in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its nearest competi tors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size resources and assets Word of the acquisition caused Enrons shares to increase some one of th e few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months Shares of Enron rose cents or percent to in midday trade o n the New York Stock Exchange on Nov As of early morning trade on Nov Enron shares were priced at Shares of Dynegy gained or percent to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange An archi ve list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at

and European leaders agreed to disagree over a glob al warming treaty as the president sought to reassure allies that sharp polic y differences would not hamper relations between Europe and the United States During several closeddoor sessions Bush and his European counterparts confronted one of their most contentious areas of disagreement the presidents rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming We agreed t o disagree Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters The Europe an Union is sticking to the Kyoto Protocol The United States has chosen anoth er policy Analysis It is rather amazing how prominently energy issues have factored into the first six months of the Bush administration In contrast to the eight years of the Clinton administration when energy policy often took a backseat to other concerns President BushFa result of California blacko uts a national shortage of natural gas skyhigh electricity prices and a controversial energy task planFbeen comparatively consumed by energy iss ues Now in a political legacy from the previous administration President Bush finds himself grappling with another contentious energy problem that has global ramifications Departing from what appears to be an international consensus President Bush has declared the Kyoto Protocol an ineffective treaty and has instead decided to further examine the greenhouse gas proble m which has raised further questions about the presidents commitment to environmental issues First let me provide some background The Kyoto Protocol developed out of meetings held in December in Kyoto Japan during which time the Unite d Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in principle to a series of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions About governments of various countries including the United States participated in the Protocol and agreed to reduce their aggregate carbon dioxide CO equivalent emissions by at least percent below levels by Noticeably exempt from the Protocol were developing countries such as China and IndiaFof the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the worldwhich resisted taking on any sort of formal reduction plan until industrialized countries proceeded with their own This marked the central flaw in the Protocol in that participants such as Europe Japan and the United States argued that it would be impossible to reach the Protocols goals without th e active and controlled participation of developing countries Consequently the United States could not garner twothirds support from the Senate whic h would be required to ratify the Protocol despite endorsement from the Clinton administration The United States is the largest emitter of CO accounting for onequarter of the world total per year and thus its participation in the Protocol has been considered essential The Protocols emissions targets include all major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide NOx and greenhouse gases created by industrial processes which are artificial chemicals called halocarbons CFCs HFCs and PFCs and longlived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride SF The Protocol requires the main developed countries to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gases by varying amounts percent for Europea n Union countries percent for the United States and percent for Japan With the onset of his new administration President Bush announced last Mar ch that the United States would not support the Kyoto Protocol again arguing that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic Further Bush has voiced the concern that ratifying the Protocol would severely damage the US economy as it would restrict industrial production The president has also pointed out that although European nations espouse support for the Protocol none of the EU members has yet to ratify the treaty Instead President Bush has adopted a goslow approach toward global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem and work with other nations to produce a better plan A new report from the National Academy of Sciences requested by the Bush administration found that global warming is indeed occurring as the result of human activity Specifically the report found that the Earths temperatures could rise between and degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century On the other hand the report could not reliably establish ho w much of the warming trends result from natural variations how fast future warming will occur or how corrective actions might correct it Thus the president asserted that these unanswered questions warranted further investigation into the greenhouse gas problem The president has come under fire both domestically and abroad for what is perceived as a policy that gives preference to business over the environmen t In addition to his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol President Bush also announced in March that he opposes any domestic restrictions in CO emissio ns from the nations power plants retracting on a pledge that he had made during his campaign Carbon dioxide is not classified as a pollutant by the Clean Air Act and thus the White House said that Bushs original promise w as a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production Toward that end the Bush administration has focused on the construction of some new power plants across the count ry to resolve a growing supply demand imbalance On the other hand business groups have applauded the presidents approach echoing his belief that the Protocol would harm the nations economy and that domestic technologybase d solutions represent a better solution This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th e debate I wont use this space to criticize or defend President Bushs environmental stand Instead I think it will be useful to clearly identify the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto Protocol European leaders have vowed to enact the Protocol without the United States which may not be possible The Protocol can only be enacted if nations that produced percent of the industrialized worlds carbon dioxi de in decide to ratify it Japan could be the wild card in the debate as it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it I f Japan does participate proponents of the Protocol would have percent of emissions enough for ratification Nevertheless here is how the two approaches shake out The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside nt Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal expected some time th is summer in a recent radio address With new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment the president said The Bush administrations previously released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nations energy supply through the expedited construction of new generation including nuclear power plants Further the president has said that energy production and environmental protection are not competing priorities and c an both be achieved with new technology While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions for limiting CO emissions from existing or new plants the new technology to which he has referred most likely includes cleancoal technologies that can be implemented to reduce emissions from coalfired plants As noted in the IssueAlert new cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed by various companies throughout the United States One example is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More tha n percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada As coal remains the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves muc h of the nations plan for reducing emissions will focus on coalfired generation It is important to note however that most of the cleancoal technologies currently being developed eliminate SO pollutants and NOx bu t may do little to address CO emissions which is the primary focus of the Kyoto Protocol President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi ve years and help developing nations such as China and India to match the US commitment The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has said that the European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the Kyoto Protocol As noted the participation of another large industrialized country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol If the Protocol is enacted an international conference will be held in Bonn Germany this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b e reached Toward this end French President Jacques Chirac recently commente d that Now is not the time to conduct new studies These studies have alrea dy been done We have to set objectives Specifically European countries wil l proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc h as CO produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels The EU has said that if ratified it will comply with the Protocols standards for emissio ns reduction by and go significantly further to reduce emissions beyond that date Yet interestingly across the Continent nuclear power which produces no CO emissions has undergone a resurgence and presently generat es an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and Germany However we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio ns that took place during the Clinton administration Most of the emissions targets of the participating countries will be reached through emissiontrading mechanisms Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price commonly agreed In other words industrialized countries that do not meet emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d o better than required This may encourage reductions to be made where they a re most needed However critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant reductions Moreover the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe an Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse gases There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan d and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol Without US participation the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large industrialized country such as Japan decides to join On his own President Bush now moves forward with constructing a plan for the United States that attempts to balance the reduction of emissions while aggressively expanding the countrys generation supply This will be a difficult balance to achiev e but the president remains confident that environmental protection and industrial expansion do not need to be mutually exclusive An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEOwners of transmission systems across Alabama Florida Georgia Mississippi and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding MOU to develop a regional transmission organization RTO f or the Southeast A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end of this article Two of the largest members of this new organization are Southern Company NYSE SO and Santee Cooper If the transmission owners prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity the RTO would be one of the nations largest covering more than miles o f transmission with an investment in assets in excess of billion Analysis The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern Company However the development of this muchanticipated RTO illustrates how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating answers questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives a nd raises speculation about possible impact on the regions alreadyestablishe d RTO GridSouth Further as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the country much of the commissions focus has been placed on the Southeastern United States along with the West The Southeast is dominated by large IO Us that control massive transmission assets Thus seeing that Southeastern transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for FERC You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo rm its own RTO the organization that will manage a transmission network withi n a particular region FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth er than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy In addition it is FERC s general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country and the commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous if it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity Thus FERC unequivocally told Southern Company to not reapply for RTO status until it had explored joining forces with neighboring companies Simultaneously FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth an RTO formed by Carolina Power Light Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas SCANA Southern Companys neighbors to the north The conditional approva l came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the SeTrans Gridco Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority TVA about joining GridSouth Again FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to see a single large RTO serving the entire Southeast region Nevertheless now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit h seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate entity from GridSouth I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what impact if any the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on GridSouth However as of press time representatives for GridSouth had not prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity I spoke with John Sell a Southern Company spokesperson on June Sell informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with GridSouth upon FERCs directive but determined that GridSouth was too far down the road in terms of its development and that Southern Company plann ed on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets For instance while both entities are forprofit operations the new Southeast RTO plans to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Further althoug h the term Southeast RTO is being used in the press release Sell told me that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as SeTrans the name of Southern Companys rejected entity Sell stressed tha t the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern has majority power over the RTO In fact the name will be changed to something else later this year On a related note one statement that I found particularly interesting in t he press release about the new RTO is that the companies have also made it clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi on owner but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which they will operate and make decisions This is clearly a veiled reference t o Southern Company which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in its original RTO filing When I spoke with John Sell he volunteered that Southern is not the driver behind this RTO Santee Coopers involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha t precarious fashion As noted FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w ay to incorporate Santee Cooper a stateowned utility located in South Carolina into its RTO As Santee Cooper controls about miles of transmission lines covering percent of South Carolina it is no wonder that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was conjoined in some way to developing RTOs There was just one problem with this plan the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from joining forprofit enterprises The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi c power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations to join RTOs New reports indicate that if the SeTrans RTO is approved by FERC it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power entity However it is important to note that Desert Star an RTO based in Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states includes the Western Area Power Administration WAPA which owns about onethird of the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to of of the states municipal electric systems Naturally as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a forprofit entity th e question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a member given the South Carolina law I spoke with Stephen Pelcher associat e general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper about this conundrum There is an important distinction that should be understood GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents Caroli na Power Light Duke and SCANA The obstacle facing Santee Coopers participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder in a private corporation Under the SeTrans RTO in which Santee Cooper is now a participant none of the participating companies will have ownership over t he transmission entity As noted this was one of Southern Companys main interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Pelcher told me that the SeTrans RTO is still in a preliminary stage and thus it appears at this time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe nt third party Interestingly Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper and b y extension the SeTrans RTO remains in consultation with GridSouth for a coordination and implementation service agreement that would in some way interconnect the two entities One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems Specifically FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o ne RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO s could become speed bumps in the flow of electricity In fact the commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy related to these seam issues Part of the reason that Southern Companys original independent RTO plan was rejected was FERCs concern that the utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive interconnected system in the region At this point it appears that FERC favors standardization in h ow adjacent RTOs will relate to each other and thus has instructed developing RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements FERC reportedly is planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this year Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether or not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist Thus as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow it will need to determine how i t will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida and any other adjacent RTOs In addition Southern Companys John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement At this point TVA has made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and in fact as a federal agency is under no obligation to join an RTO The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for the commissions deadline of being formed by Dec of this year If the SeTrans RTO or whatever it is ultimately called gains FERCs approval it will represent a significant part of the Southeasts development into a functionally competitive electric market If FERCs stated policy of consolidating RTOs is effectively applied ultimately we could see that GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO which now includes Southern Company Santee Cooper and through a seam agreement TVA Moreover the development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of conjoining companies that transcend federal state and municipal levels

Editors Note Yesterdays IssueAlert incorrectly identified Las Cruces as the town used for an energy management pilot project The correct town is Laredo Texas IMAGE IssueAlert for February Florida Study Recommends Wholesale Deregulation by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Floridas political and business leaders moved cautiously toward deregulati ng the states electric industry in a move last week while vowing to avoid problems such as those in California Floridas Energy Study Commissio n unanimously recommended that the Florida Legislature consider deregulating wholesale electricity The move could spark construction of a number of pow er plants in the state Analysis Florida Gov Jeb Bush created the Energy Study Commission wi th the intent of submitting an initial deregulation proposal for consideration in this springs legislative session Floridas energy market represents a billion industry so obviously there has been great interest on the par t of new energy suppliers that want to begin serving the state Florida continues to move slowly toward deregulation across all levels Competition on the retail side may take several more years especially as t he California crisis is causing many states to adopt a more cautious approach to removing state regulations The commissions recommendation to initiate deregulation on the wholesale side is considered a small step toward reachi ng the ultimate goal of total deregulation in the state Specifically the commission has endorsed a plan that would allow outofstate companies to build new merchant power plants in Florida and se ll wholesale electricity to the states utilities Florida law forbids outofstate electric utility companies from providing yearround service t o utilities and customers but merchant plants can provide backup service to existing utilities when energy reserves are stretched thin to avoid power outages and rolling brownouts Also under the commissions plan instate utilities would also be allowed to sell their regulated plants at depreciat ed values to affiliated companies that would compete headtohead on the wholesale market In addition the states utilities could engage in longterm power contracts with suppliers instead of relying on the open market a major difference from Californias original plan and state regulators would still review all wholesale contract prices The commission s plan must still be approved by the Florida Legislature and the commission readily admits that approval may not be easily obtained due to the ongoing crisis in California At the present time no official start date for electric competition in Florida has been announced The states go slow approach is characteristi c of other Southeastern US states many of which continue to enjoy comparatively low electric rates Floridas renewed interest in deregulatio n is being driven by the belief among several commission members and other officials that competition eventually will result in lower rates for consumers Or at the very least competition should prevent rates from continuing to increase as they reportedly would under a regulated structure The commissions plan also is intended to prevent power supply problems in Florida similar to those in California by allowing for new generation to b e built in the state by external companies Florida law requires power companies to hold percent of their power supplies in reserve to that the y can handle periods of extreme usage However both the commissions chair a nd Gov Bush have suggested that Florida will face a shortage of electricity i n the next decade unless outofstate companies build new plants Consumer groups and municipal electric providers have resisted the commissions recommendation In general such groups fear that deregulating Floridas wholesale market would lead to higher electricity bills since big utilities in the state would be allowed to earn higher profits that may or may not result in benefits for consumers In fact the Florida Municipal Electric Association recently argued that annual electricity prices in Florida would rise by between million and billion if the commissions plan to initiate wholesale deregulation is approved In addition Floridas utilities have been rather effective in persuading stat e officials to move slowly toward deregulation perhaps out of concern about losing their monopoly status Walter Revell the chairman of the Energy Study Commission denied that the group is considering any plan that would be partial to the states largest investorowned utilities which include Florida Power Light Tampa Electric Florida Power Corp and Gulf Power The commissions recommendation supports what is already a fastgrowing wholesale business in the state of Florida with outside power companies su ch as Duke Enron Calpine Corp and others aggressively trying to penetrate t he state and gain a foothold for when deregulation emerges in full force Such power suppliers may be accurately surmising that Florida is headed toward a supply demand imbalance as has occurred in California An imbalance of this sort would offer competitive opportunities for power suppliers in the state According to a report in the St Petersburg Times merchant power companies have announced plans to build some plants across Florida just over the last year or so However the article stated that the Floridas bi g utility companies still have enough clout to block any plant proposal For instance Florida Power Florida Power Light and Tampa Electric joine d forces last year to block Duke Energy from constructing a plant near Dayton a Beach Yet Duke pushes forward and recently said that it would revive plan s to build a merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach Fla Dukes plans to build t he plant had previously been blocked by a Florida Supreme Court ruling that su ch plants were prohibited under state law Enron unveiled plans for two peaker plants in Pompano and Deerfield Beach Fla several weeks ago Construction on both sites is pending city and sta te environmental department approval but Enron hopes to have both MW facilities running by summer Enron expects the Department of Environmental Protection to license each peaker plant for days each yea r with roughly days powered by natural gas and the rest by oil Enron is also in the preliminary stages of planning a mile liquefied natural gas LNG pipeline between the Bahamas and Port Everglades Fla The company ha s an option on a acre site in the harbor of Grand Bahamas Island where it hopes to build a conversion and treatment terminal for LNG Calpine received approval to build a MW natural gasfired plant to supp ly electricity to Seminole Electric Cooperative The plant will be part of the proposed Osprey Energy Center in Aurburndale Fla next to an existing Calpine MW cogeneration plant According to Calpine beginning in June Seminole Electric Cooperative will distribute electricity from Osprey for years to member electric cooperatives Reliant Energy is also finding its own way to penetrate the new openings in to the Florida market Just last week Reliant Energy Services an unregulated wholesale power subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced that it has entered into agreements with affiliates of El Paso Energy Corp to purchase future supplies of power from several new facilities to be built in Florida Under the tolling agreements Reliant Energy Services has secured the right to utilize and dispatch electric generating capacity totaling approximately MW The electricity will be generated by two new naturalgas fired simplecycle peaking plants to be owned by El Paso Energy that will be located in Pasco and Hardee counties The new plants are scheduled to be completed by the spring and summer of These are just a few examples of the many companies that plan to take competitive advantage of the anticipated opening of Floridas market While Florida clearly has no plan to open deregulation on the consumer level any time soon competition in the state does appear to be gaining momentum at least on the wholesale level Of course the commissions plan has not yet been fully approved by the Florida Legislature and critics claim that the states big utilities still wield a great deal of influence over the extent to which competing power suppliers will be allowed to participate in the states market There are many debatable nuances within the Florida commissions plan Yet one positive thing is that Florida does appear to b e making valuable steps to increase its own power supply addressing a proble m that many have accused California of ignoring Having learned the lesson fr om California Florida seemingly acknowledges that there is simply no guarante e that power will be readily available at tolerable price levels on the open market Thus this plan to increase the availability of power supply within the state through increased merchant plants seems to be a prudent approach An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a sponsorship of

Analysis News Item from The Washington Post March President Bush has decided n ot to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide CO emissions of the nations power plants reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli es on Capitol Hill In a letter to four Republican senators Bush cited a rece nt Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO emissions would result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs I do not believethat the government should impose on power plants mand atory emissions for carbon dioxide Bush said Analysis The sudden change in President Bushs position on CO emissions naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate The extent to which CO contributes to the nations pollution and whether or n ot the government should take an active role in restricting CO emissions has become an intensely politicized issue Democrats and environmental groups responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bushs decision will ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy I wont attempt to debate the political aspects of the presidents decision Rather I will analyze Bushs current position impacts the energy industry and whether or not the lifting of COrestrictions does indeed contribute to a sound energy policy It is true that during his campaign the president made promises to limit C O emissions In a speech in late September Bush said With the help of Congress environmental groups and industry we will require all power plan ts to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time Yet while many critics have claimed that Bushs refusal to place limits on CO is a philosophical turnabout White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that carbon dioxide should not have been included as a pollutant in Bushs campaign position because it is not classified as one in the Clean Air Act Further the White House has said that Bushs original promise was a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production In fact although many scientists believe that CO is a key contributor to global warming it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human health Consequently CO has never been classified as a pollutant under th e Clean Air Act because in the eyes of those determining Clean Air classifications it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact except as it applies to concerns about global warming In his decision to abstain from placing any restrictions on CO emissions Bush noted the incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of and solutions to global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f or removing and storing carbon dioxide The president maintains that he is committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality emissions of NOx SO and mercury which are already regulated as pollutant s but not CO Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce emissions from power plants specifically but that any such strategy would include phasedin reductions and marketbased incentives to help the indust ry meet the targets Moreover the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio ns on CO emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on domestic power supply Clearly any limits on CO emissions would have tremendous impact on coalburning power plants By some estimates coal a relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than percent of the electricity generated in the United States produces about percen t of the nations CO output more than any other fuel Yet industry officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO emissio ns would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production Since Bush took office as president in January it has become increasingly clear that a major component of the presidents imminent energy plan will be efforts to increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa l natural gas and nuclear The president has maintained that he sees a supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar However according to reports out earlier this week Bush is proposing to cut the DOEs renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by to percent In any case establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time and the president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis resulting from a growing supply demand imbalance Aside from power supply concerns the president also acknowledged the curre nt high prices for natural gas and how a reduction in coalfired generation would most likely keep prices at their high levels In fact the president said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba ck away from CO restrictions more than any pressure he might have received from oil and coal lobbying groups as has been reported in many recent news articles Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO emissions would have led to significantly higher electricity prices The translation of this is that if restrictions were to be placed on coalburning plants many power suppliers would turn to naturalgas production as an alternative Naturalgas supplies are already compromised in this country due to increasing demand which has driven prices up to unprecedented levels Bushs decision reflects the concern that if power suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers this wi ll continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high This is important new information that warrants a reevaluation especiall y at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage President Bush said The DOE report also indicated that because coalfired power plants are the major power sector emitters of CO compliance with the emission caps would be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production both nationally and regionally If COcaps were to be put into place substantia l reductions in coal consumption would result according to the DOE with corresponding drops in the projections for coal production Further becaus e coal has a carbon content more than percent higher per Btu than that of natural gas the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to CO caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants uneconomical In addition to the DOE report Bush continues to be counseled by an energy advisory team including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party Many Republican senators including Jesse Helms North Carolina and Chuck Hagel Nebraska expressed alarm over Bushs campaign promises to reduce CO emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying an international treaty regarding pollution control The Kyoto Protocol negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified would commit industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO along with SO and NOx emissions Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last November but are expected to resume this July If ratified the Protocol would limit CO emissions below levels Currently CO emissions in th e United States are about percent over levels Reportedly Sens Helm s and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be directed by an international treaty It is important to note how the presidents new stand on CO emissions relates to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Just two weeks ago t he US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air However the EPA does not currently regulate CO emissions EPA Administrator Christine Whitman in a series of public statements had vehemently defended and supported President Bushs previously espoused commitment to controlling CO emissions Meanwhile the presidents change in policy precedes several bipartisan bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO SO and NOx Given the presidents new stance however the prospects for these bills gaining much momentum may diminish In summary President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to shortterm resolutions to the nations energy crisis over longterm environmental concerns Given the fact that coal presently generates more than half of the nations energy needs the fossil fueldespite its deba ted environmental impactsis a critical component of the US energy supply Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the countrys power supply it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy reliance on coal to continue at least for the near term While some will continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise s and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists an argument can be made that the nations supply problems have worsened since last fall when the president was campaigning After examining the mix of current factors including consistently high naturalgas prices demand that remains on the rise and a continued reliance on coal which remains comparatively inexpensiveit is understandable that the president would take this posi tion However the general consensus among scientists is that CO emissions contribute to global warming and that a longterm solution to curb CO emissions must be enacted As President Bush unveils his energy plan over the next few weeks it will be interesting to see how or if he addresses th e issue of CO emissions from a longterm perspective An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a sponsorship

Pacific Gas Electric Co NYSE PCG the utility unit of PGOCorp on Friday filed for reorganization under Chapter Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco The company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Gov Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Pacific Gas Electric Co reportedly has more than billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases Neither PGOCorp nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing Analysis Despite the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing has been in the making for several months and that its financial insolvency appeared inevitable the actual filing for Chapter protection on Friday caught many by surprise including Californias top officials Ironically the utilitys million customers may end up being the least impacted by the bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co will remain in the business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court However there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of Californias largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and across the country the full impact of which is not presently known There naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major news so I wont waste time regurgitating information that is being widely disseminated Rather I will focus on what I believe to be some of the key elements of this story The bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to PGOthat the state of California would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a price that PGObelieves the assets to be worth In addition a new rate increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of Pacific Gas Electric Cos existing debts The night before the bankruptcy filing Gov Davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated that the rate increases would be contingent on PGOselling the transmission assets to the state In other words if PGOagreed to the states price for the transmission assets a portion of the rate increase would be used to alleviate the utilitys subsequent debts The inside word is that Pacific Gas Electric Co was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to disagreements with Gov Davis regarding the price of the transmission assets which could be anywhere from billion to billion Officially Pacific Gas Electric Co said that its negotiations with the state were going nowhere The CPUC had previously approved rate increases of up to percent for the customers of SCE and Pacific Gas Electric Co but clearly stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing debt In his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy Gov Davis reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for nonresidential customers that would average about percent Davis had fiercely resisted any form of a rate increase to accommodate Pacific Gas Electric Cos debt The official PGOresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to pay off existing debts of the utility operation PGOCorp and other nonutility subsidiaries are not impacted by the bankruptcy measure at least for now Due to a shrewd financial restructuring that was approved by FERC a few months ago see Issue Alert for more information highprofit subsidiaries such as National Energy Group and PGOGas Transmission Northwest Corp were placed into a specialpurpose bankruptcy remote entity known as GTN Holdings LLC Consequently these nonregulated subsidiaries along with the parent corporation may not be impacted by the utilitys bankruptcy filing The US federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits were divided among the parent operation and other nonregulated subsidiaries but for the time being only Pacific Gas Electric Co has declared bankruptcy Power suppliers still owed money by PGOcould likely never get paid Much of Pacific Gas Electric Cos billion debt is owed to power suppliers that sold power to the utility over the last year or so With the onset of lengthy legal proceedings it becomes more unlikely that these power suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon Consequently power suppliers owed more than million by Pacific Gas Electric Co also saw their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement According to a report in Reuters Duke Energy NYSE DUK was down or percent at Dynegy Corp NYSE DYN was off or percent at Williams Companies NYSE WMB was or percent lower at and Reliant Energy NYSE REI lost or percent to In addition there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company even if the state of California remains involved as the buying intermediary For its part PGOCorp Chairman Bob Glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to eventually pay all our debt in full but he did not report a specific figure In addition to the power suppliers banks that have provided loans to Pacific Gas Electric Co such as Bank of America Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase could all be impacted by the bankruptcy Pacific Gas Electric Cos preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as Bank of New York to which it owes more than billion Although some payments may be made after years of litigation such lenders and bondholders may be forced to write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to Pacific Gas Electric Co as losses The blame game is in full force Davis and state regulators have repeatedly blamed outofstate generators for price gouging and federal regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices Also Gov Davis has issued harsh words against PGE Over the weekend Davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate PGOfor awarding an estimated million in bonuses and raises to about midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of the utilitys bankruptcy filing Management at PGOis just focused upon padding their own pockets not in discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California Davis reportedly said Earlier Davis had previously issued a statement saying PGOmanagement is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed In addition California regulators have criticized FERC for not implementing wholesale price caps in the Western region which they believe would help to stabilize the market in California US Sen Dianne Feinstein said that it is inexcusable that FERC has refused to intervene and provide temporary stability and reliability through the use of wholesale price caps Feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price caps for the entire Western region For its part FERC refused to take responsibility for the California crisis saying instead that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing was the unfortunate result of a massive failure by policymakers at all levels PGOblames decisions made by the CPUC and Gov Davis that it believes undermined its ability to return to financial viability and recover its uncollected costs Specifically PGOblames the California government for not allowing it to recover prior wholesale power costs through recent rate increases which essentially has kept the utility in a debt situation PGOalso believed that the governor was not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of PGEs transmission system to the state Consumer groups continue to lambaste the utility and its parent company which they claim has billion in available capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt Could the bankruptcy filing of SCE be far behind The secondlargest utility in California continues to maintain that it intends to avoid bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a comprehensive solution to our current crisis However because the two utilities have been so closely linked through the states energy crisis PGEs decision to declare bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that SCE will eventually follow suit In fact Moodys Investors Service is reporting that Pacific Gas and Electric Cos bankruptcy increases the possibility of an SCE bankruptcy filing Further Moodys is reporting that numerous creditor groups particularly the small generators have become impatient with the time that it has taken to advance settlement discussions with the state of California thereby increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors On April the day of Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing shares of SCE tumbled or nearly percent to finish trading at Surprisingly SCE shares jumped about by midmorning on April to trade at about The reason for the increase is not fully known although SCE continues to remain involved in negotiations with Gov Davis regarding its own outstanding debt This is just the start of a long drawn out legal process The electric utilities that previously declared bankruptcy including El Paso Electric Public Service Company of New Hampshire and El Paso Electric all found themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years Thus although we may not know the ultimate outcome for Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings we do know that the company will be essentially consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial records for the foreseeable future Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco has been assigned the PGOcase Montali will have the ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how PGOreorganizes or arranges to repay its debt Several positive elements of the process that might work to PGEs advantage is that the utility will now be held accountable to only one individual Judge Montali Pacific Gas Electric Co will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and federal lines Second by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are completed market dynamics hopefully will have improved and Californias supply problem should be resolved Consequently Pacific Gas Electric Co could eventually rise again like the phoenix out of its ashes and emerge as a much stronger company than it is today An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

April SCE Agrees to Sell Transmission Assets to California by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis At a joint press conference with Governor Gray Davis Edison International Chairman President and CEO John Bryson announced agreement on a plan to restore Southern California Edison SCE to financial health The negotiat ed resolution with the Governor is far preferable for our company our employe es and for our customers than is going into bankruptcy Bryson said The key part of the agreement is that the state will receive a primary utility asse t SCEs mile transmission system SCE employees will operate and maintain the system through a contractual arrangement with the state Analysis Only days after Pacific Gas Electric Co its California utilit y counterpart declared bankruptcy SCE announced what is being billed as a pact with the State of California that should keep it out of bankruptcy court From all appearances this seems to be a strong deal for SCE as it not only keeps the utility financially solvent but also removes it from a line of business that remains rather uncertain and financially unrewarding First lets establish the key aspects of the agreement Keep in mind that the California Legislature the California Public Utilities Commission CPU C and federal regulators must approve this deal Edison International NYSE EIX the parent of SCE has agreed to sell the utilitys transmission asse ts to the State of California for billion The confirmed price tag that the state is paying for SCEs lines seems like a generous offer because it is about times the systems current book value of billion the origin al cost less any accumulated depreciation OCLD recorded in SCEs books Since transmission rates are based on an allowed rate of return on OCLD it is uncertain that SCEs current transmission rates will provide sufficient revenues for the state to cover its purchase cost The sale includes only SCEs transmission assets It appears that SCE will remain in the distribution business and continue delivering power to customers and running generation Both the state and SCE have agreed to commit to no less than billion of capital investment in utility infrastructure over the next five years which presumably includes upgrades to the transmission system and new generation capacity It is not entirely clear at this time how the billion in capital investment will be shared between the State of California and SCE Edison officials also have agreed to sell costbased not marketbased electricity to the state from power generated at SCE plants Edison Mission Energy the unregulated subsidiary of Edison International is also obligat ed to sell output from its Sunrise power plant exclusively to California under costbased pricing Although SCE divested much of its power assets under agreements with the CPUC it still shares ownership of the San Onofre Nucle ar Plant Units and with San Diego Gas Electric SDGE and shares in the Palo Verde Mohave and Four Corners generating stations SCE also owns hydroelectric facilities and the Pebbly Beach generating facility The Sunrise Mission power project is a gasfired power plant that is currently under construction Reportedly the Sunrise plant is expected to provide about MW of electricity during peak periods of demand this summer According to the Memorandum of Understanding between SCE and the California Department of Water Resources SCEs generation assetsincluding all en ergy capacity ancillary services and any combination thereofwill be commit ted to costbased ratemaking for SCEs bundled service customers In addition SCE is prohibited from selling any of these generation assets until Dec Also included within the agreement is SCEs commitment to dismiss all pendi ng lawsuits against the CPUC related to market prices in California Edison International also has agreed to refund million to the utility unit th at reportedly had been paid in dividends to the parent company The billion that the state is paying SCE for its transmission assets can be used to pay preexisting debt to creditors including power generato rs that have previously sold power to SCE This is the essential benefit that the utility receives in the deal and it is a considerable achievement given that the liquid capital theoretically should stave off bankruptcy proceedings It is also important to note that this is the first revenue stream that has been specifically earmarked for SCEs preexisting debts Recent rate increases that have been approved by the CPUC can only be appli ed to subsequent debts incurred by the utility In addition SCE will be allow ed to issue bonds to recover a substantial portion of the approximate billion in debt that the utility has accrued due to uncollected purchases o f wholesale power The agreement should return SCEs debt to investment grade making it easier for the company to raise money to fund future operations By reducing its debt load Edison CEO John Bryson remains confident that SCE can borrow to pay out remaining debts SCE Chairman and CEO Stephen Frank expressed confidence that a final agreement could be reached before the end of the year although the California Legislature reportedly has agreed to expedite its own review of the agreement and provide approval before summer temperatures begin to wrea k havoc on the California market If for any reason the sale of the transmission assets has not been completed within two years SCE is obligat ed to sell to the state its hydroelectric generation facilities instead at a tobedetermined price Although the deal is expected to proceed some concerns have been raised about federal issues related to interstate commerce In addition the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cowith whi ch SCE has often been intertwinedremains in bankruptcy court could also complicate the agreement between SCE and the state News of the agreement immediately caused Edison shares to increase by about or percent to on April As of the close of trading on April Edison shares were priced at about For its part SCE said that it was racing toward an agreement with the governor to avoid being forced into an involuntary bankruptcy Yet for som e time SCE has been more willing to sell its transmission assets than PGOeve r appeared to be In fact I wrote in the IssueAlert that Gov Davis had reached an agreement in principle with SCE regarding the sale of the transmission lines Most of the key elements of the agreement that has been agreed to by both parties have been in the works for over two months PGOCorp issued a statement that it was pleased that SCE had been able to reach an agreement with Gov Davis but said that the agreement did not change its own direction toward bankruptcy court According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom Fitch analysts have suggested that the sale of SCEs transmission assets to the state of California could in fact lend a framework that might be used in Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings What this might mean is that Federal Judge Dennis Montali the official overseeing Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy might rely upo n the agreement between SCE and the State of California to mandate a similar deal for PGE Gov Davis commented that the SCE deal could serve as a bas is for separate agreements with SDGE and eventually PGE if they choose to come back to the negotiating table In fact the state could submit a plan to Judge Montali outlining a purchase of PGEs transmission assets which the judge could ultimately enforce An argument could be made that the agreement SCE has reached with the State of the California provides benefits to the utility that go beyond protectin g it from bankruptcy One could argue that SCE benefits by being able to exit the transmission business altogether which in many ways can cause tremendo us problems for the companies that choose to remain in this business Transmission operations also typically offer a low rate of return in SCEs case according to its most recent K filing its transmission business resulted in a return on equity of percent SCE had proposed that the return on equity for its transmission assets be set at percent which FERC rejected FERC has ultimate authority over transmission service pricing Thus the question could be raised of why SCE would even want to remain in the transmission business given this low return on equity Behin d the scenes SCE could very well have previously made the determination that its transmission business was not a valuable part of its overall operation This could be representative of an international trend as regulatory agencies in Australia and Great Britain have also set lower limits on the average transmission network charges that utilities can implement Moreover the State of California does not bring extensive operational expertise to its new role as a transmission owner Thus the state is wise to keep SCE employees in charge of the operation and maintenance of the transmission system This substantially reduces the risk for the state whi ch is a prudent move From the states perspective it gets an asset in exchan ge for a bailout which makes its investment in SCE beneficial However the transmission business will present unique challenges for the state such as raising capital for transmission improvements and siting procedures The state may quickly learn why the transmission business is perceived as being so challenging and why it is difficult to entice companies to build new transmission lines especially considering the low rate of return that the transmission business offers On the other hand by assuming the role of a transmission system owner the State of California will be in a position to obtain competitive information about the activities of power generators in the state This could result in a significant advantage for the State of California if it remains in its current powerbuying role An archive list of previous

Source According to a new report from Energy Info Source the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has begun to articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs With several approvals a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO application FERC is shaping RTO participation among investorowned utilities Analysis The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO applications based on decisions that the commission has made up to this point According to Energy Info Source FERC has concentrated its efforts on the Southeast and Western regions Within the Southeast FERC has essentially rejected Southern Companys SeTrans Gridco while conditionally approving GridSouth and Grid Florida In the West the RTO West applicationwhich represents an alliance among nine utilitiesappears to have received FERCs favor and is the preeminent leader among nonISO RTO participation efforts However despite these established trends FERC still remains at odds with many of the leading transmission owners in the nation which foresee a potential conflict between the commissions rulemaking on transmission rates and its potential impact on retail rates which are regulated by individual states For background an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission systems within a particular region The origins of FERCs RTO policy dates back to its December Order in which it strongly encouraged all transmissionowning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO by Oct with actual membership established by December of this year FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received and its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members of the commission hold Over the last year or two FERC has engaged in an ongoing debate between its preference for transco forprofit models for RTOs as opposed to independent system operators nonprofit Chairman Curt Heacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model while other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs However moving forward it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate including the limit of one entity per region As noted FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the Southeast and Western regions In addition to the obvious need to establish stability in the West another explanation for the commissions dual focus is that other regions in the United States namely the Midwest and the Northeast already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO FERC may be focusing on the West and Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established an acceptable level of market independence The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending before FERC The RTO West which FERC has referred to as the anchor of the region has been generally accepted as a broad concept RTO West includes nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest Avista Bonneville Power Administration BPA Idaho Power Montana Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power BPA is by far the largest of the RTO West members controlling about percent of the transmission system in the region For the most part RTO West is an ISO although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella The second western RTO is Desert Star which includes utilities that are located in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas The third proposed RTO for the Western region is the California ISO which has been operational since April and wishes to remain a standalone entity FERCs main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its desire for one RTO in the area instead of three The primary rationale for this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be more easily managed than multiple entities In addition gaming by power generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs which would require additional market rules to control the gaming FERCs general approach has been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed The California ISO has tweaked the commissions patience in particular as this solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join other entities The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps in California whenever reserves fall below percent This has been something that the state has long requested but the price caps come with the condition that California must file an application by June to enter into an RTO with other Western states Otherwise the price caps will be lifted California is currently contesting this condition Under the leadership of Chairman Heacutebert it is clearly FERCs goal to establish only one RTO for the entire Western region which puts the federal agency at odds with the California government once again The Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares Heacuteberts belief that one regional RTO is the best strategy for the West but also has said that proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the new organization up and running Other western governors have stood in unity that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being Across the country there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the Southeast For instance Chairman Heacuteberts preference for minimal RTOs within one region appears to be a national viewpoint Yet there are unique questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in the West The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida RTOwhich includes Florida Power Light Florida Power Corp and Tampa Electricand GridSouth RTO which includes Progress Energy Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas However FERC rejected Southern Companys SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies other than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy The commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo but told Southern Company not to reapply and to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO In addition FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over control of their generation assets The rejection and conditional approval from FERC which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth have been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in the region should join the alreadyapproved entities In fact FERC reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority Santee Cooper and SeTrans GridCo so that they might also join Some reports indicate that because the Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model such as the one in California FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with its own longterm goals which include a single RTO for the area Nevertheless despite receiving approval from FERC GridSouth is taking issue with two aspects of the commissions approval First GridSouth questions FERCs jurisdiction over bundled retail service and specifically wants the commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled transmission rates GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates including the charge for transmission service under FERC jurisdiction which would allow the commission to change the rates in the future FERCs Order which essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States clearly states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would agree to GridSouths interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled transmission rates Despite these isolated disputes the formation of RTOs across the United States appears to be coming together While the industry awaits for further FERC action on pending RTO applications it is clear that certain trends are emerging FERCs longstanding preference for the transco model over the ISO model appears to be diminishing as evidenced by the commissions approval of RTO West and apparent support of nonprofit operations such as the New York ISO and the Midwest ISO Rather FERC has demonstrated a more primary preference for solitary RTO entities within a region regardless of whether the entity operates as a transco or an ISO From a philosophical perspective establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple entities Further a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain intertie problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region However it will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in independent RTOs such as California to relinquish their autonomy and join forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding the operation of a transmission system An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

approached Calif Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal now made public that offered monetary concessions if the state drops lawsuits and investigations into the companys alleged price gouging Duke made the offer in a secret page letter sent in April to Gov Davis office which the governor confirmed on May Davis spokesman called the letter Dukes wish list which included having the state call off investigations of the North Carolinabased generator Although Gov Davis has acknowledged receipt of the proposal he has not officially accepted or rejected the offer Analysis Dukes desire to make a settlement with the state of California stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March At that time FERC put California power sellers including Duke on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification for their prices Duke is considered to be one of four companies along with Dynegy Reliant and Williams that faces the biggest potential refunds to the state of California In fact Duke reportedly faces potential refunds of up to million for the power that it has sold to California since the start of this year We can fast forward from FERCs investigation to Dukes good faith settlement offer that now sits before Gov Gray Davis The plan sets out specific action steps for new generation conservation programs electric and gas infrastructure improvements regional transmission frameworks and environmental goals In addition Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement agreement for which the California government would agree to cease all ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company Dukes appropriate payment is based on fair estimate of the companys alleged overcharges for power that it sold to the state Yet beyond the spin control surrounding this offer Dukes proposal amounts to a mutual backscratching agreement with Duke clearly obtaining the largest benefit Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke made by the governor and others In return Duke will refund to the state some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping the state with its power supply needs However under the offer Duke will admit no wrongdoing Rather the companys proposal is being presented as an altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of Californias flawed market Neither Duke nor Gov Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Dukes settlement offer but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction of the million that the state wants Other specifics within Dukes proposal that are important to note include the companys commitment to work with the state to get MW of additional peaking capacity ready for summer In addition Duke has offered to enter into longterm contracts with the state on reasonable terms and also attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Dukes pledge to share the financial pain of Californias troubled market with other market participants Presently Duke supplies about percent of Californias power needs the majority of which is based on longterm contracts This is a significant point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market in contrast to many of the other power suppliers under FERCs investigation The company also owns the Moss Landing plant located south of San Jose Calif which it is upgrading with a million investment Duke has established that the plant should be able to provide approximately percent of Californias new generation in While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits the companys total wholesale profits soared percent to million for yearend For the year Dukes California power plants generated percent more electricity than they did in In addition in the plants provided million megawatt hours of electricity to the states power grid versus million the previous year Further in January and February Duke charged more for power through credit premiums which were levied because of the risk of nonpayment associated with Californias financially struggling utilities Duke claims that it is still owed about million by the Department of Water Resources Californias power purchaser Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California On May Tulsabased Williams Co also one of the top four companies reportedly owing the most to California announced that it has agreed to pay million to the California ISO to end FERCs investigation into whether the companys plants were kept offline to drive up prices For several months FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the companys alleged shutdown of two power generation units owned by AES which reportedly allowed Williams to sell power from other units at higher prices The stipulation and consent agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties In other words Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing or price manipulation A Williams spokesperson has said that the million will be deducted from the million that Williams is still owed for power sales to the California ISO and the California PX Much like Duke Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year For yearend the company reported unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for In addition the company reported Q unaudited results that were more than double that of Q million or cents per share compared with a restated million or cents per share Moreover the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made from power sales to the state However one benefit of the deals is that they would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation Yet at least as of this writing Gov Davis remains less than enthused about Dukes offer and has not eased off from his accusation that Duke along with the other power generators has bilked millions of dollars from California consumers In fact although the governor has said that he is willing to continue negotiations with the various power generators he has also vowed not to call off the dogs in the state and federal investigation of any price gouging Toward that end the states lieutenant governor has initiated a classaction suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other power generators accused of price fixing This legal claim follows similar suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego All of the suits basically claim the same thing that Duke and four other power generators engaged in unlawful trading practicessuch as shutting down plantsto drive up market prices in California Duke of course maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied Nevertheless Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the companys part could eventually be determined The stakes have also been raised with some California attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price gouging should face civil and criminal penalties which could include incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the price manipulation to take place Consequently despite Dukes offer and any other proposals that subsequently come from power generators it appears that litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Manfred Raschke International Strategic Information Services ISIS Contact Janet Gellici at or wwwwesterncoalcouncilorg IMAGE IMAGE May Presidents Bush Former and Current Speak on Energy Issues By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIntroduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corps CEO Chris Hamilos President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this morning at the th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque NM The st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career and reiterated his strong support for his son President George W Bush whom he affectionately refers to as as in rd president The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy However the former president did field questions from the audience regarding a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he faced in his administration and those that are presently challenging his son Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current presidents justreleased energy task plan a page report that outlines approximately steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia The former president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against Saddam Hussein who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world Further President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his presidency during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress that saw the big picture issues in a different light often made it difficult to find common ground The former president made only brief but rather significant references to his sons new energy policy Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney last evening former President Bush said he was aware that the new broadbased plan focused heavily on new supply along with secondary measures for conservation efforts This is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that if you want to lower energy prices you need to establish more supply In addition the former president offered that additional drilling efforts an element of the plan that has sparked a great deal of controversy has to happen if the nation is truly committed to increasing supply However former President Bush did suggest that the nation must be patient as it will take several years to see any significant decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new development efforts Meanwhile the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate As expected the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge easing of cleanair rules that should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit process for oil refinery expansion and construction These platforms have been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan However new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few days are raising the most eyebrows For instance the extent to which nuclear power factors into the administrations energy plan is perhaps greater than was previously anticipated Specifically the Bush plan proposes the extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of socalled breeder reactors which use spent nuclear fuel Breeder reactors although rather common in Europe and Japan have not been used in the United States since the s when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce nuclear weapongrade plutonium as a byproduct Other key elements of the plan include Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government which would supersede states rights to approve new transmission line capacity Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting and speeding up the relicensing requirements for nuclear plants Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury which are common byproducts of coalfired production In turn the Bush administration supports exploring new cleancoal technologies which should increase production by coalfired generating plants A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air Act which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power plants The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued As has been the case since the start of the new administration the continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts However the specific conservation proposals in the energy plan include providing consumers billion in tax credits through to encourage the purchase of highmileage gaselectric hybrid vehicles In addition President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to cogeneration plants which produce both heat and electricity Others including the current presidents father might argue that conservation efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as market forces high prices already are driving renewed conservation across the country Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that often thwarted his policy measures the current President Bush continues to buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy plan In fact just two days ago a group of House Democrats led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMiss outlined a plan that calls for increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan However Democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles Consequently the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and Democrats to support cooperation in Congress That cooperation may be necessary as Congress must approve President Bushs energy plan in order for it to take effect TOMORROW Summary of CIS Conference and analysis of key IT issues facing the energy

and Republicans since the November elections not for seven years as was incorrectly stated in the column We apologize for any misunderstanding that this error might have caused IMAGE IMAGE May EDF Pursues Italys Montedison Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEPower giant Electricitde France EDF has sent shock waves through Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise its stake in electric firm Montedison to percent from about percent However Romano Prodi the European Union commissioner for competition is considering an intervention in the battle between EDF the French electricity monopoly and the Italian government The latter has passed an ad hoc law restricting EDF to percent of the voting rights for Montedison the Italian electricity supplier spun off by Enel Analysis Once again the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the European power market with EDF playing the staring role For the last year or so as the European Union EU has enacted electric competition across the Continent Frances EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by foreign suppliers Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through its ownership of London Electricity the French power firm has wanted for some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy However the neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market As I have mentioned before in this column France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country As a result EDF which controls approximately percent of the French electric industry may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad until it further opens its own market to competition To date France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the EU and EDF has played a large role in this resistance While other European countries such as Germany have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although other companies such as Spains Endesa have attempted to push through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country Nevertheless EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its holdings in Montedison one of Italys main electricity companies Reports are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison EDF recently said that its stake increased from percent to percent However other reports have indicated that EDF already controls about percent of the capital assets of Montedison Both increases in Montedison were made recently which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market regulatory Consob EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the companys financial assets across Europe However at the same time EDF has also indicated that any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading purposes In other words EDF wants to control the generating assets of Montedison for resale across Europes wholesale market Further with a percent stake EDF would become Montedisons largest shareholder and a major presence in Italys power market even as France remains mostly closed EDFs argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian government The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators In fact EDF has admitted that its strategy is to make percent of its turnover from activities abroad by the end of compared with percent currently Consequently it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its home country for expansion opportunities and these opportunities typically have been in distribution and generation assets Moving forward the company has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation For instance last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for the regional UK electricity company Seeboard which is owned by American Electric Power NYSE AEP Serving about two million connected customers in England Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables An acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDFs overall expansion efforts in Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales which EDF bought from Entergy in In addition EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden Graninge and Germany EnBW and reportedly is Polands largest electricity distributor These acquisitions were made by EDF International which is wholly owned by the French government and thus subject to EU oversight Perhaps due to EDFs size and presence in Europe these previous acquisitions were allowed without a great deal of EU intervention However now that other countries have voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede it is unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny As noted trading appears to be the next wave of EDFs expansion efforts Toward this end EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in to create an energy trading company called EDF Trading The various companies that EDF has invested in across Europe support the companys efforts to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across the Continent For its part the Italian government has responded that it will block any increase of EDFs ownership of Montedison based primarily on the argument that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France Specifically Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison Further outlining its position the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be sold by Enel one of the countrys main power firms As Montedison will be one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel the Italian government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and thus having access to additional power assets in Italy For instance Enel is planning to sell Elettrogen a generation company that produces about percent of the production capacity in Italy If EDF were to increase its stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen then EDF as a foreign entity would gain a lock over the Italian power supply market Italys antiEDF law is an interesting development but it does not mark the first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent Spain also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with regard to the French companys pursuit of Hidrocantabrico Spains fourth largest supplier However despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict any expansion of EDF the laws although they are already in place may ultimately be deemed anticompetitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates antitrust allegations in the United States any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles EDF also remains interested in the Spanishs largest power utility Endesa which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the French electricity market through a percent acquisition of French electricity generator SocieacutetNationale dElectricitet de Thermique Endesa which recently terminated an attempted merger with Iberdrola Spains second largest power firm has been viewed as a takeover target for larger companies such as EDF At last report the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on how far control was being exercised In other words EU intervention will be based on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an increased stake in Montedison The fact that France remains resistant to electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the governments of Italy and Spain An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North

Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEThe City of Dallas has become another of Texas major customers to take advantage of the savings available in the states emerging competitive electric market The city has signed an electricity contract with AES NewEnergy Under the terms of the contract AES NewEnergy will provide electricity to approximately service accounts located at municipal sites throughout the city that are currently served by TXU Electric The city of Dallas one of the nations largest cities has a population of more than million people Analysis The date at which Texas customers will begin to receive power from new suppliers under the states electric pilot program has been pushed back to midJuly but today marks the start of when new suppliers begin turning in their bid forecasts to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT Full electric competition begins in Texas on Jan Thus its a good time to do an assessment of the many interesting dynamics that have emerged in the Lone Star State some of which might pose unique challenges to the states electric market As Texas continues to prepare for full competition its electric pilot program is getting off to a rather slow start at least on the residential side an ongoing debate about incorporating Texas into the national transmission grid continues and ERCOT defends itself against claims that the state should be closely watched this summer At the same time Pat Wood the states highestranking utility regulator marks his departure from Texas to assume a position with FERC In previous columns Ive established the main points of Texas restructuring plan see IssueAlert at wwwscientechcomrcifor a review As incumbent utilities in Texas are allowed to create unregulated energy providers that can compete outside their traditional service territory an interesting game of musical chairs is taking place among the various incumbent competitors For instance Dallasbased TXU is positioning itself to hold on to its North Texas customers while expanding into Houston while Houstonbased Reliant attempts to retain its base in Houston while moving into Dallas At the same time new competitors AES NewEnergy among them have moved into the state attempting to get a jumpstart on securing customers during this pilot phase At last count regional electric providers have registered with the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to provide power to Texas customers Also worth noting is the fact that after much speculation I recently confirmed that AEP has indeed registered as a retail electric provider REP in Texas under the name Mutual Energy representing approximately one million customers First lets look at the electric pilot program After issuing a recent delay in the start date for the pilot originally slated for June to ensure that computer systems were running effectively those Texas customers participating in the pilot should start receiving power from new providers in midJuly State officials had high hopes that most of the percent of the states electric customers eligible to participate in the pilot would select a new electric provider However at last count fewer than percent of the residential customers that are eligible have signed up since enrollment in the pilot began Feb this represents about percent of TXUs residential customers and percent of those currently served by Reliant The pilot officially ends when full competition begins Fears arising from the national coverage of the California situation appear to be dissuading Texas residential customers from participating along with general apathy about electric service Also at play is a percent discount that residential and small business customers receive from their incumbent utilities which may lower the incentive for these customers to seek out a new provider While Texas residential customers appear hesitant or apathetic about electric competition the states large industrial and commercial customers are eagerly embracing the opportunity to sign on with a new electric provider There are about large electric users in the state defined as those businesses that consume more than MW of power at peak usage Ccustomers have filled up many of the slots available in the pilot program for their customer classes and naturally appear to be generating the most competition in the state Within this space AES NewEnergy is gaining momentum In addition to its contract with the city of Dallas NewEnergy also secured a deal with HEB one of Texas leading retail companies with stores in the state AES NewEnergy is a subsidiary of AES Corp NYSE AES which controls more than MW in countries Formed in AES NewEnergy claims to be present in very state where a competitive energy market is emerging I spoke with representatives from the city of Dallas regarding their selection of AES NewEnergy among other providers including those based in Texas Interestingly NewEnergy was the only REP that responded to the citys bid Another large deal was recently announced between Cinemark USA which operates movie theaters around the state and TXU Under the contract TXU will provide energy services to Cinemark theaters outside of its traditional North Texas service territory Unlike the city of Dallas which only received a bid from one REP comparative price was a factor in Cinemarks selection of TXU Whether or not Texas should be forced to join the nations transmission grid is a debate that has been heating up over the last few weeks Ironically although President Bush usually supports free market forces he reportedly is considering a mandate that would force ERCOT into becoming interconnected with the nations two other transmission grids the Western Interconnection and the Eastern Interconnection Presently ERCOT stands independent from the other two grids and wants to keep it that way However because Texas is generally thought to have excess power it is now being considered that the Lone Star State should be made to export some of that supply to powerstarved California Presently this is not possible due to the fact that ERCOT has limited interconnections to surrounding power pools This is not the first time that this issue has been tossed around While President Bush was still governor of the state the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT studied the option of linking Texas to the other grids and found that it would be cheaper for the state to remain disconnected However as the issue of FERCs oversight over regional transmission organizations gains momentum the Bush administration may overrule Texas current sovereignty over its transmission system Further the debate on this issue is related to the policy of eminent domain in the Bush administrations energy plan which would give FERC the power to buy state property for the construction of interstate transmission lines However the question of just how much excess generation Texas might have to give to California has come into question over the last several weeks The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC sparked the controversy recently when it issued a report identifying a number of areas in the United States that should be watched closely this summer due to supply concerns In the same report NERC also mentioned that Texas should be watched closely but out of concern about the states pilot program rather than supply deficiencies ERCOT immediately disputed NERCs claim reiterating the states oftrepeated contention that it is more than prepared for competition and in fact has a percent reserve power margin In addition Texas officials point to the fact that since new plants have started operations in the state generating MW By the time competition begins fully in January more plants and MW are scheduled to come online Nevertheless in response NERC stood behind its assessment which it based on two possible ramifications of the summers pilot NERC is concerned that as Texas consolidates control areas into one and percent of the states utility customers switch to new providers as is hoped by the state this could take a toll on transmission capability Another challenge facing Texas is the shrinkage of its regulatory commission As noted Pat Wood has now officially left his post as chairman of the PUCT to become a FERC commissioner Woods departure leaves only Brett Perlman as the sole PUCT commissioner something that concerns many stakeholders as a number of final decisions on rules that will govern Texas electric market are still pending Texas Gov Rick Perry has made no announcement as to when Wood might be replaced on the PUCT along with Judy Walsh who left the commission last January Moreover the fact that the states pilot program has not attracted a large number of residential customers is not surprising Texas may not have a strong competitive residential market for some time considering the percent discount for residential and small business customers that was included in the states restructuring plan Rather the competitive Cmarket which is where the largest savings can be obtained anyway may be the true test of the success of Texas competitive market This determining factor along with the states ability to retain a strong power supply ultimately will decide the fate of Texas electric industry Because the vast majority of the new generation in Texas is fueled by natural gas there are also some related concerns about competitors being able to beat the fixed rates of utility REPs if naturalgas prices remain high However despite these factors Texas is clearly gearing up for competition and pursuing deregulation in its own independent fashion The eyes of the energy industry remain fixed on Texas as the statewhich by the way will reportedly soon become the largest state in terms of megawatts generatedcontinues its attempts to distance itself from the national debate that has somewhat tainted electric deregulation

approached Calif Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal now made public that offered monetary concessions if the state drops lawsuits and investigations into the companys alleged price gouging Duke made the offer in a secret page letter sent in April to Gov Davis office which the governor confirmed on May Davis spokesman called the letter Dukes wish list which included having the state call off investigations of the North Carolinabased generator Although Gov Davis has acknowledged receipt of the proposal he has not officially accepted or rejected the offer Analysis Dukes desire to make a settlement with the state of California stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March At that time FERC put California power sellers including Duke on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification for their prices Duke is considered to be one of four companies along with Dynegy Reliant and Williams that faces the biggest potential refunds to the state of California In fact Duke reportedly faces potential refunds of up to million for the power that it has sold to California since the start of this year We can fast forward from FERCs investigation to Dukes good faith settlement offer that now sits before Gov Gray Davis The plan sets out specific action steps for new generation conservation programs electric and gas infrastructure improvements regional transmission frameworks and environmental goals In addition Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement agreement for which the California government would agree to cease all ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company Dukes appropriate payment is based on fair estimate of the companys alleged overcharges for power that it sold to the state Yet beyond the spin control surrounding this offer Dukes proposal amounts to a mutual backscratching agreement with Duke clearly obtaining the largest benefit Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke made by the governor and others In return Duke will refund to the state some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping the state with its power supply needs However under the offer Duke will admit no wrongdoing Rather the companys proposal is being presented as an altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of Californias flawed market Neither Duke nor Gov Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Dukes settlement offer but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction of the million that the state wants Other specifics within Dukes proposal that are important to note include the companys commitment to work with the state to get MW of additional peaking capacity ready for summer In addition Duke has offered to enter into longterm contracts with the state on reasonable terms and also attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Dukes pledge to share the financial pain of Californias troubled market with other market participants Presently Duke supplies about percent of Californias power needs the majority of which is based on longterm contracts This is a significant point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market in contrast to many of the other power suppliers under FERCs investigation The company also owns the Moss Landing plant located south of San Jose Calif which it is upgrading with a million investment Duke has established that the plant should be able to provide approximately percent of Californias new generation in While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits the companys total wholesale profits soared percent to million for yearend For the year Dukes California power plants generated percent more electricity than they did in In addition in the plants provided million megawatt hours of electricity to the states power grid versus million the previous year Further in January and February Duke charged more for power through credit premiums which were levied because of the risk of nonpayment associated with Californias financially struggling utilities Duke claims that it is still owed about million by the Department of Water Resources Californias power purchaser Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California On May Tulsabased Williams Co also one of the top four companies reportedly owing the most to California announced that it has agreed to pay million to the California ISO to end FERCs investigation into whether the companys plants were kept offline to drive up prices For several months FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the companys alleged shutdown of two power generation units owned by AES which reportedly allowed Williams to sell power from other units at higher prices The stipulation and consent agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties In other words Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing or price manipulation A Williams spokesperson has said that the million will be deducted from the million that Williams is still owed for power sales to the California ISO and the California PX Much like Duke Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year For yearend the company reported unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for In addition the company reported Q unaudited results that were more than double that of Q million or cents per share compared with a restated million or cents per share Moreover the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made from power sales to the state However one benefit of the deals is that they would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation Yet at least as of this writing Gov Davis remains less than enthused about Dukes offer and has not eased off from his accusation that Duke along with the other power generators has bilked millions of dollars from California consumers In fact although the governor has said that he is willing to continue negotiations with the various power generators he has also vowed not to call off the dogs in the state and federal investigation of any price gouging Toward that end the states lieutenant governor has initiated a classaction suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other power generators accused of price fixing This legal claim follows similar suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego All of the suits basically claim the same thing that Duke and four other power generators engaged in unlawful trading practicessuch as shutting down plantsto drive up market prices in California Duke of course maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied Nevertheless Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the companys part could eventually be determined The stakes have also been raised with some California attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price gouging should face civil and criminal penalties which could include incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the price manipulation to take place Consequently despite Dukes offer and any other proposals that subsequently come from power generators it appears that litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Electric Industry Analysis News item from Reuters Ontario Canadas plan to open its electricity mar ket to competition could happen earlier than the May target date but the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report a spo kesperson for the provinces energy minister said earlier this week Its opening Were just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead said Chris tine Smith a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy Science and Technolog y Ontarios government will make the decision regarding the start date for competition once the readiness report which documents the preparedness of all the agencies involved in the privatization process is completed and r eviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris Analysis The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario Canad as most populous province may actually be on the near horizon is a major development considering that deregulation in the region has been in the wo rksand has encountered several delayssince Shaken by the fiasco of direct access in California along with the sudden price spikes that occurr ed in Alberta Canadas only fully opened market officials in Ontario hav e been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in t his region However it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward with its deregulation plan despite concerns from some of the major players in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become a nother troubled experiment in electric deregulation Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario it is necessar y to establish some key points about Canada as a whole the province of Ont ario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White N orth From a national perspective electric deregulation in Canada is occur ring on a provincebyprovince basis much like the United States is deregu lating its market on a statebystate basis At this point only Alberta h as deregulated its electric market which occurred in January Beyond Ontario none of the other Canadian provinces British Columbia Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island Quebec Sas katchewan or Yukon have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating th eir electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a wait andsee perspective Part of this reticence toward deregulation among othe r Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally l ow energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nat ion are vast and rather isolated from each other thus making the issue of transmission interconnection a challenge Ontario is an exception to this general rule as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is interconnected with other provinces and the United States As noted Ontario is the most populous Canadian province the home to mi llion people with an average power usage of terrawatt hours a year and representing a billion electric market The three main utilities in On tario are Ontario Power Generation the former Crownowned utility that was formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate commercial companies in April and currently controls a total generatin g capacity of approximately MW Ottawa Hydro which is owned by the city of Ottawa and Toronto Hydro which was created as a result of the con vergence between six utility companies serving Toronto Toronto Hydro consi sts of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company but owns no generation of its own Of the three Ontario Power Generation has the market share in the province reportedly serving about percent o f Ontarios power market Deregulation of Ontarios naturalgas market took place in the late s Following plans that had been in the works since at least electric de regulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November a lthough it was postponed another months due to concerns from officials a fter witnessing the welldocumented problems in California Energy Minister Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Albertas experience with e lectric deregulation Competition in Albertas wholesale and retail power m arket began on Jan a time at which wholesale prices for natural g as were staggeringly high High demand and short supply in Alberta caused r ates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian govern ments Naturalgas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dram atically as elsewhere in North America but not before the Alberta governm ent was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sha rp increases Under Ontarios evolving deregulation plan retail markets will remain unde r the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board the provincial power regulator and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets Under th e retail system customers will have the option of arranging their electric ity purchases directly from suppliers at fixedprice contracts or having e nergy purchased for them by distribution companies agents brokers or mar keters at fluctuating prices Most reports indicate that Ontario is well po sitioned to open its market to competition at least from a supply perspect ive in fact Ontario government officials have claimed that the province h as adequate power supply fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy along with planned investments in new generation However other observers have c laimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is servi ng as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region Reports fro m earlier in indicated that Ontario will need an additional MW o f generation in addition to its existing capacity of MW to meet dema nd and only one MW plant had been officially announced In addition despite the assurances from the government some companies hav e claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board is fundamentally uncompetitive For instance one company that appears to have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgaryba sed TransCanada Pipelines Ltd Canadas largest naturalgas pipeline compa ny and a huge player in the countrys regulated marketplace One of the key criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario gove rnment is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontarios highquality generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation leav ing only undesirable plants on the auction block In other words even in a deregulated market Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the mark et share of generation in Ontario TransCanada claims that this approach wi ll diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new gene rating companies from entering the province TransCanada which has previou sly made acquisitions of naturalgas fired plants in Alberta and the northe astern United States does not think that the province will offer a very co mpetitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ont ario electric market Note that in midOctober Mirant Corp NYSE MIR an nounced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of t he gas marketing business of TransCanada making it the largest naturalgas marketer in Canada and the largest naturalgas exporter to the United Stat es Under the Ontario Energy Boards deregulation plan Ontario Power Generatio n must sell or lease MW of its nonnuclear power within months of the opening of the Ontario market Currently Ontario Power Generation owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Obviously the governmental mandate regarding the d ivestiture leaves the bulk of the provinces generating capacity under the control of Ontario Power Generation which is a major point of contention f or potential competitors It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wils on does not share TransCanadas perspective In fact a spokesperson for th e office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system and the gasfired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario both of which Onta rio Power Generation will be divesting represent very valuable assets that should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the d eregulated market Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only a bout opportunities in Ontarios electric market and the company already ha s rather extensive gaspipeline investments in the province Nevertheless enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets curren tly owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ont arios deregulated market Moreover Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market but a good number of concerns about the provinces plan for deregulation remain unresolved There is great anticipation for the report that is expected sh ortly from the Ontario Energy Board which may specifically address the div estiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies su ch as TransCanada Certainly there is great hope that no further delays of the deregulation start date in Ontario and that province officials either maintain or accelerate the May start Just as Canadian officials have closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States US co mpanies continue to monitor Canadas slow provincebyprovince progression toward competition As noted Mirant Corp already has gained a market edg e in the naturalgas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanad a Duke Energy Calpine Corp and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Can adian naturalgas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy Enc al Energy and Anderson Exploration respectively The next horizon for the Canadian energy market is electric deregulation and industry eyes remain o n Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta

Analysis News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE shares fell sharply in ope ning trade on Nov after the humbled energy giant warned it could be for ced to pay by next week million in debt triggered by a credit downgrad e last week The shares were down or percent to just over in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange The stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the secondmost active stock on the NYSE As of early morning trading on Nov Enron shares were priced at reportedly their lowest level in nearly years Analysis To paraphrase Shakespeare Oh what a tangled web they weave whe n first they attempt to Wait I better stop When speaking about Enron I am not prepared to finish that sentence at least at this point Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks but at this junct ure an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigation has y et to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the p art of the Houston trader Enron itself has admitted that its financial rec ords from through the first half of should not be relied upon Nevertheless perception is reality and the perception currently in the ind ustry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following yea rs of skirting the truth While negative perception continues to cause dama ge to Enrons stock perhaps of more current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality We know Enron has just lowered its third quarter earnings faces a stiff payment of million due within a week in fact and has cast doubt over its Q earnings potential The question of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a material adverse change in the eyes of Dynegy which still aims to buy Enron but wi sely included an exit clause in its purchase contract The other question i s what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar A termi nated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enrons a lreadyweak credit standing and it is unknown how the company could recove r from another blow to its reputation As has been the case since the first of October the ongoing fall of Enron story is changing by the day For background on Dynegys proposed acquisi tion of Enron and Enrons financial problems that precipitated the proposa l please see my IssueAlert available at wwwscientechcomrci h In the intere st of time let me summarize what is happening at this moment Dynegy rode in as Enrons white knight and plopped down a billion offer a share to buy the company which at the time represented a steal of a price cons idering that Enron was priced at almost a share little more than a year ago To some extent this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga In other words the company had gone through a tumultuous year hit its r ock bottom but still planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy Inc its muchsmaller rival The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fa ct interrupt the nuptials between the two companies For starters on Monda y Nov Enron submitted its Q report to the SEC which was five day s late by the way In the report Enron dropped what have turned out to b e several bombshells First Enron disclosed that due to recent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moodys Standard Poors and Fi tch it has to pay off or refinance by Nov debt it owes to a third part y with which it has a partnership or face nearly billion in additional payments Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt Enron would not disclose who owns the note but we know that the limited partnership includes holdings in CEG Rio a Brazilian natural ga scompany that Enron had planned to sell to raise about million in cas h Note that just last week various credit services lowered Enrons senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned that further down grades may occur which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment Reportedly if Enron does not make the million payment by Nov inv estors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for a n amount equal to the note payable Enron is presently scrambling to establ ish a mutually acceptable amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent paymen t of million Enron said that any further drop in its credit rating mi ght necessitate further payments of billion to other partnerships the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust Also in the new SEC filing Enron increased its Q loss by cents a s hare to cents Enron originally reported a Q loss of million but has now raised that figure to million As a minor bright side Enron d id increase reported earnings for the first nine months of by a penny to cents a share attributed to adjustments made after the quarters end However looking forward Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings Enron also claims that even still the numbers co ntained in the Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen the companys external auditor Thus further revision of the numbers could take place Interestingly there does not seem to be a big question about whether or no t Enron can pay the million debt obligation Enron apparently has secu red an additional billion in loans from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week In fact within the current SEC filing Enron says that i s has billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and n et collections Thus some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the million payment if it is unable to r enegotiate terms with lenders According to the SEC filing Enron also inte nds to sell off billion in noncore businesses that are performing belo w acceptable rates and would use the proceeds to pay off debts although t his money would probably not be immediately available Again however there is a perception element to this development that shou ld be noted Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past i n such a way as to keep them off the companys balance sheets Apparently this nondisclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addin g too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock As has been well documented Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inve stigation regarding potential conflictofissues involving its former CFO News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nervous about Enrons stock As I said the question of the hour is whether or not Enrons new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer As usual the answer all depends on who you ask Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enrons financial status to Enron Investors are rather mixed on the questi on Some say that the facts disclosed in the Q report do not dramaticall y change Enrons position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisi tion and that the current drop in Enrons stock is just a kneejerk respons e to the media hype surrounding the story Further those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money com ing in from various sources Thus it should have no trouble making the million payment From a broad perspective so one theory goes Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock pri ce and the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combined company as North Americas biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity In contrast other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agre ement was signed Enrons stock has fallen an additional percent whic h weakens the original acquisition agreement In addition if Enron follows through with the million payment next week or secures additional fina ncing to front this cost both options alter the companys financial positi on from when Dynegy made its original offer which could be construed as a material adverse change Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the c ompany that Dynegy agreed to purchase New reports indicate many energy tra ding companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the companys credit concerns Such companies are now particular ly reticent to sell power to Enron for nextday delivery What this means i n practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enrons ma rket share which could diminish the value in the trading market that had a ttracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place In addition Enrons oncestel lar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse altogether Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to hel p Enron out of its financial mess Of course under the acquisition agreeme nt Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate billion assetba cked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financ ial woes which will be followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco which owns percent of Dynegy However some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done an ything about Enrons diminishing ability to secure power on the open market Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron in a strategy known as sleeving The fact that Dynegy h as not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some observers th at it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron In addition Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov in state cour t in Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consi deration of other alternatives Enron said it will defend its decision in c ourt Moreover Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agr eement The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC investigat ion possible litigation against Enron balance sheet strengths and earnin gs forecasts Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enrons Q f iling with the SEC impact the companys balance sheet strengths and earning s forecasts so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to term inate the acquisition Clearly this pending deal hinges on the development s that will take place over the next few weeks Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and determin e if the oncegolden company still represents a great deal or if pursuing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

item from Energy Info Source New York states siting board approved Astoria Energys plans to build a megawatt power plant in New York Ci ty clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January Astoria Energy hopes to have the naturalgasfired combinedcycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa ration before it can begin construction and still must receive some local permits from New York City Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC a p rivately owned energy development company based in Concord Mass Analysis The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro blems that have been identified within this region Like California New Yo rk also suffers from a supply demand imbalance However even if or when power supply can be increased in New York the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t o take their own toll on the stability of the market In other words trans mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York states siting boar d to proceed with this New York Citybased plant is significant but it sho uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government This could be easier said than done as other planned powe r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p lant construction The problems within the New York power market have been well documented Th e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since when a MW plant opened in Brooklyn It has been almost seven years s ince a MW unit in Oswego NY marked the last plant to open upstate Further New York expects only a percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years Consequently concerns about the states abil ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin g new plants in the state However at the same time environmental and com munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages the problem app ears to be particularly acute in New York City A November report issu ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC entitled Investigati on of Bulk Power Markets Northeast Region highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York CityLong Island community of million people T hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the states grid the study said Like Northern California which suffer ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints New York City and Lon g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi ssion lines Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York but cannot reach the city Being both densely populated and heavily residen tial it is difficult to site new power plants in the area Consequently percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another MW by summer Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N ew York City and New York State Demand in the state rose by MW from to or times as fast as new generation capacity was added De mand over the course of was expected to reach MW or about percent above regulators earlier forecasts It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energyefficient and envir onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area The company is a s ubsidiary of SCS Energy a privately owned energy development company forme d in for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant As noted the MW unit will be a natural gasfired facility which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEdN ew York facility pipeline The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b e million Commercial operation pending the necessary approvals on th e local level is scheduled for the fourth quarter of Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions However despite this optimism the community opposition factor should not be discounted and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos ition that Astoria Energy could face Take Sithe Energies for example whi ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year Sithe Energies originally planned a MW combinedcycle facil ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo NY Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t ime to meet demand and as a result would use local water resources for coo ling purposes Community resistance thus became an issue for the company w hich altered its plans and began to consider a MW peaking unit also po wered by natural gas that would only be operated in times of increased dem and As another example environmental and community groups won a victory in cou rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p lants in the South Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Long Island areas Each is a MW plant though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than MW A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority claimi ng among other things that the state had failed to perform adequate envir onmentalreview studies The groups claim that the state should test the pl ants for their output of fine particulate matter A lower court had ruled i n favor of the state but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups The new ruling which reportedly cannot be appealed further says that the state mu st do unprecedented air tests at the plants or shut them down by Jan In a report issued earlier this year New York State Electric Gas Corp NYSEG one of New Yorks seven utilities said the state will not have eno ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti l NYSEG in a report issued late Wednesday warned there are serious problems with New Yorks generation supply and a lack of transmission an d pipeline infrastructure According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO which manages the states transmission grid between and while statewide demand in New York rose by MW generat ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by MW Consequently given all of these factors power supplies in New York remain ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n ew generation capacity However Astoria Energy which seeks to bring new g eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c onstruction of any new plants in the region with the exception of peaker u nits whose output would be closely regimented If plans for this plant ar e blocked or significantly altered

AEP Entergy Corp and Southern Company told by FERC to charge costbased p rices instead of marketbased prices for wholesale spot transactions News item from Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FER C voted last week to adopt new rules to measure market power as a con dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe r in the wholesale market FERC commissioners said the new test would impro ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base d on supply margin assessments which examines a companys importance in se rving peak electricity loads If youre big enough to control the market a t the time we look at it youll have mitigation put on you said FERC Cha irman Pat Wood Analysis Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERCs new ruling which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend This is a mammoth ruling on FERCs part however and it holds tre mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lions share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions In addition state reg ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin king profits in their wholesale operations While FERC has presented this r uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience d in the California market the new limits on wholesale transactions can al so be seen as another example of the big stick that the commission is usi ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat ions RTO Further the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m arkets while still attempting to support competition The objective represe nts a tall order and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading Put into a nutshell FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg e unregulated marketbased rates for spot market wholesale transactions I nstead companies identified as having market power and that arent part of an approved RTO must charge costbased prices for power that isnt committ ed in a longterm contract and publicly disclose those costbased prices Columbus Ohiobased American Electric Power NYSE AEP Atlantabased Sou thern Company NYSE SO and New Orleansbased Entergy Corp NYSE ETR ha ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply ing its new standards for wholesale transactions Note that Mirant Corp a former subsidiary of Southern Company has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s eparate from its former parent The commission has essentially determined t hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate Under FERCs new market power test a gener ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici ty is pivotal during peak demand which enables the company to demand a p rice above competitive levels Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a companys market power This is a d ramatic departure from previous standards by which under one of FERCs ma in criterions a company that supplied less than percent of the power ne eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l evel There are some important exceptions to the ruling First FERC has not elim inated the utilities ability to charge marketbased rates in areas where t he grid and markets are controlled by a FERCapproved RTO This is signific ant as I will expand upon subsequently because it indicates that there ar e secondary objectives in FERCs new ruling In addition the current rulin g only impacts shortterm sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved In other words longterm contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im pacted by the ruling However the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to longterm contracts and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for longterm co ntracts may be necessary Also note that the Western market which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June was not inclu ded in the new ruling The three utilities named in the ruling now have days to submit proposal s to FERC outlining a transition to charging costbased wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer Specifically the utilities will have to post on their openaccess sametime information systems OASIS the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a hour period Moving forward the price that the utilities can charg e for noncommitted power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces The new costbased rates must be administered by an independent third party The new pricing standards revert back to an older costbased technique kno wn as split the savings The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated but essentially under FERCs new ruling the three companies i dentified will have to post their costbased incremental costs for spot po wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases Purchasers wh o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci ng or buying the power on their own The final price for the transactions w ill be the split between the sellers incremental cost and the buyers decr emental bid For instance if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MWh the transact ion price would be MWh Assuming a midnighttomidnight trading day se llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by pm What this potent ially creates is an information advantage for buyers who have six hours t o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers Some of t he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th e purchaser to game the system by having access to the sellers original in cremental bid and competing around the sellers price Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section of the Federal Power Act to apply the new marketbasedsales policy to all US sellers nationwide What this means i s that although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b elieves to be erratic wholesale markets Reportedly some companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th ey exert market power The investigation reportedly also requires power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend their tariffs within days to provide FERC with openended authority to order refunds if the c ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred I made a previous reference to the big stick that FERC is carrying relate d to participation in RTOs Remember that a few months ago Chairman Wood h ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging marketbased wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli cations advantages that the chairman equated with the new world of the d eregulated energy market With this in mind note that only Southern Compan y Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling although it may be s ubsequently expanded Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi bited some resistance in following FERCs consolidation mandate regarding n ational RTOs so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti lities have been singled out This must be particularly painful for Souther n Company which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov er the next five years Interestingly Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss enting vote in the ruling Breathitts concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu ate the impact on wholesale markets This issue will undoubtedly be contest ed and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught offguard AEP Entergy and Southern Company all issued st atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t he ruling would impact them and that they were reserving the right for pos sible litigation Moreover to summarize the commissions rulemaking I think there are a han dful of important points that should be considered First the ruling illus trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke marketprice authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman Second FERC is implementing costbased prices on the spot market only and in only very defined circumstances However this co uld be an indication that the commission may extend costbased pricing to o ther wholesale transactions including longterm contracts at a later time Third the split the savings costbased formula could become fraught wi th its own problems Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov er power sellers which will now be required to post incremental costs in t he bidding process Finally one of the inherent drivers of FERCs new ruli ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact s AEP Entergy and Southern Company utilities that have not only been deem ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a lso not yet joined an approved RTO However even though only three compani es are immediately impacted by this ruling it should not be overlooked tha t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas Thus overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their

By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Software company Caminus Corp Nasdaq CAMZ anno unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C orp Caminus said it would swap shares of its stock and pay milli on cash for Altras software business That values the deal at about mi llion based on Caminus closing price of on Oct Analysis The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry particularly impacting thos e companies that are involved in the trading sector On their own both com panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche Now that Caminus is acquiring Altras software suite which is primarily focused on the naturalgas trading sector the synergy between the two comp anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading Essentially Altra has two core businessesan energy tr ading exchange and a software business Caminus has entered into an agreeme nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio ns Together the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges Lets first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create U p to the point of this partnership Caminus and Altra were not considered d irectline competitors as Caminus business model focused on risk manageme nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions However there we re components of the companies businesses that certainly overlapped Camin us Corp has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline TradeSpark Ho ustonStreet etc Altras software which is used in the same energy tradin g portals focuses on naturalgas transactions Headquartered in New York Caminus which went public a year ago is a prov ider of software solutions and consulting services that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat ed with energy trading Toward that end the company offers two software pa ckages ZaiNet software solutions which enables energy organizations to effectiv ely trade and manage energy transactions ZaiNet has been designed to add ress a wide range of energy commodities traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and thirdparty s ystems Nucleus software systems which were designed specifically to meet the trad ing risk management scheduling and accounting needs of utilities genera ting companies power pools gas and oil producers processors pipelines and other energy market participants In other words the Caminus Nucleus s ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize track and manage thei r various energy transactions from generation to enduser delivery One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an d market positions in realtime and consequently determine acceptable risk levels Recently Caminus added the Storefront product which is a Webbased tradin g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet Also just t his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston Caminus unveiled a new so ftware product known as FrontOffice which gives traders of energy physica ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction According to company r eports approximately percent of Caminus revenue comes from software li cense sales In addition Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse s on risk management services for energy clients One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel y is its efforts along with other software companies to establish a commo n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra nsaction risk management systems A few months ago Caminus established t he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet and has since generat ed interest in some companies to participate and help create universal s tandards for energy trading One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro tocol for energy trading platforms The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions In September Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp w hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions Un der the partnership Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing transaction trading and risk management systems to create what they are calling a St raightThrough Processing STP environment for vertically integrated ener gy companies By comparison Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry Altra re portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d irect access load generation dispatch regional transmission organization RTO connectivity integrated OASIS reservations and North American Elect ric Reliability Council NERC checkout and billing Altra boasts a custome r list of about clients mostly in the gas sector but also including po wer and multifuel companies Altras software product suite includes trans action management tools known as Altra Gas Altra Power Altra Pipeline and Altra Web which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity According to Caminus the value of acquiring Altras software suite is to c reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga s and power traders Further the exchange of customers should benefit both companies Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s ervices to Altras customer base and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altras new generation of systems to Caminus customers The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp In fact Cam inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently explo ding According to Caminus CEO David Stoner the global market for wholesa le energy trading which consists of the European market is six to eight t imes the size of retail markets Consequently a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user In terestingly about to percent of the companies to which Caminus has p rovided risk management consulting services are US companies attempting t o expand in the European wholesale trading market Caminus consultants help ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA for the British go vernment due to be implemented by the end of or early Although smaller than the US market Britain has been experiencing privatization a nd various levels of deregulation since providing valuable experience and depth Besides the UK Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy Spain Holland Belgium Germany and the Nordic countries through N ORDPOOL Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently when fallou t from the events of Sept began to impact the companys business For Q Caminus reported that its total revenues increased percent to million compared to million for Q Specifically revenues from the companys software license fees increased percent to milli on during the same quarter However for Q Caminus lost or cents a share on revenue of million due primarily to the fact so me license sales that were expected to close did not Specifically Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter Given the impact that the events of Sept ha d on many companies a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke d as scheduled Moving forward Caminus says that the addition of Altras software should r esult in an increase of its revenue guidance by about percent Cami nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its Q earnings to cents a share compared with a previous estimate of cents a share al though analysts are still projecting cents a share for the fourth quarte r Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions However with these opportunities come considerable risks Hence creating this balance between risk and opp ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a nd Altra operate However the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive Every month new competitors in this space emerge so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list However so me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam inus Altra are Allegro Development KWI and SolArc to name just a few Moreover competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state The whole sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret ail market and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol esale market before it reaches the end user Thus consolidation within the energytrading software space should continue and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings Clarification Statement to IssueAlert on Dynegy In its Q ea rnings statement Dynegy

Causes New State Federal Conflicts By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The federal government has reached a deal with a c oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo rnia under a million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state Construction on the socalled Path project which was announced by Ener gy Secretary Spencer Abraham will begin in the spring of and could be completed by as early as summer Analysis The California energy crisis which clearly subsided over the sum mer of due to new generation that came online in the state mild weath er patterns and conservation efforts is generally considered the result of a severe supply demand imbalance While this may be true what often get s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the statethe lines that actually transport power from point A to point Balso played a primar y role in creating the tremendous instability of Californias energy market This problem still persists today and as California heads into the winte r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing The Dep artment of Energy DOE has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to Californias main transmission line While this is a positive step the upgrade creates a new level of state federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th e hands of private companies which creates a whole new set of potential co nflicts Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path upgrade there a re some things that we know for sure First Path which is owned by Pac ific Gas Electric Co is a mile highvoltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif ornia During the peak of the energy crisis in California Path became r ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks points at which transmission c ould not transport high volumes of power This preempted any transport of power from Southern California and Arizona and Mexico to the north whic h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor nia cities As noted these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand which is obviously a concern as w inter approaches The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat es energy market Ironically power supply is no longer seen as an imminen t problem New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou ld have operating reserves of between and MW this winter which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season However the report on the states transmission system is n ot as positive If the Northwest continues to experience a drought then No rthern California will still need to import more power from the south Heav y dependence on the strained Path could once again cause reliability pro blems for California Thus deficiencies along Path can be seen as a symptom of larger problem s that continue to plague California and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months if not years In fact there is a history here that is worth noting especially as it relates to f ederal state jurisdiction When President Bush released his national ener gy plan in April of this year he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path Following through with this order Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo nses from companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path The current contract which will add a new line to the existing Path is the result of that previous directive At present it appears that PGE Corp NYSE PCG the parent of Pacific G as Electric Co and six other companies have signed on to financially su pport the upgrade The six other companies that will spearhead the project are the Transmission Agency of Northern California TransElect Inc Kind er Morgan Power Co PGE National Energy Group Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and the Western Area Power Administration WAPA a federal ag ency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in wester n states and operates miles of transmission lines Presently Path connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t he states largest generation facilitiesPacific Gas Electric Cos Diabl o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energys Morro Bay naturalgas power pla nt The upgrade will reportedly include a new kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about MW from these two plants Further when t he upgrade is finished in Path should be able to carry a total of MW of power Of course the first question that I asked was Who is going to pay for the upgrade The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line The rema ining percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade The exact percentages of i nvestment and ownership have yet to be defined but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next days You may ask why these comp anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California Th e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr ough fees charged to use the new transmission line This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project who presumably ant icipate that California will remain a highdemand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported As I mentioned there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th is upgrade plan First there is the issue of potential state federal reg ulatory conflicts Presently state governments have jurisdiction over powe r line siting Thus the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path prior to Secretary A brahams call for privatecompany bids Specifically the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas Electric Co which it regulates to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path As seems to be a growing occurrence we may find that there is a state federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali fornia Gov Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t he states prerogative and have issued strong criticisms over the DOEs ve nture into this territory However in his energy plan President Bush seem ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca pacity If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE it is no t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area In any event representatives from TransElect one of the participating companie s have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state and public and private interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project Note that TransElect was the company that had unsuccessf ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California E dison earlier this year Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOEs upgrade plan for Path are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of Californias transmission grid The DOEsponsored upgrade u nlike the one that the CPUC has directed reportedly would not be subject t o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC Further bec ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n ew line these companies will be able to charge tolls to the power market ers that use the lines to transport power This is most likely a point of c ontention for California officials especially Gov Gray Davis who has sou ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p rivatecompany ownership of generation facilities in the state The positiv e side of this issue is that according to the DOE the bids from private c ontracts enable the upgrade of Path to proceed without any increase to either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am erica As a side note in addition to Path the CPUC is also proceeding with a n ew transmission line in Southern California known as the ValleyRainbow In terconnect transmission line Although the timetable has been delayed until San Diego Gas Electric is proceeding with a volt transmiss ion line that would connect Southern California Edisons Valley Substation near Romoland Calif with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo w Calif area just south of the RiversideSan Diego county line The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDGEs an d SCEs transmission systems The first interconnection is at the San Onofr e Substation near San Clemente Calif The project is designed to deliver a pproximately MW Moreover the expansion of Path is a necessary step to help California l ower its risk for further reliability problems Due to generation developme nt the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors The state government still has its hand in power purchases which represe nts a huge part of the states energy market The state has accrued b illion in debt to buy power for the states utilities the recovery for whi ch remains an unresolved issue While Gov Davis has preferred to increase the states role in Californias energy infrastructure this new DOEsponso red project on Path puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies An

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE stock sustained further he avy losses on October as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years The energy giants stock was off or percent a t per share at midday trade on Oct making a cumulative loss of percent for a week in which it reported a thirdquarter loss of mi llion As of early morning trading on Oct Enron shares were priced at a reflection of new developments including a new Securities and Ex change inquiry that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest ors Analysis Enrons first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa rture many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enrons share pri ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role A t the time of Skillings departure Enrons stock had tumbled to a week low However based on the new Q report it now appears that Enrons downw ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company s top spot In essence Enrons financial problems have been caused by bus inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor e focus on wholesale power sales It appears that Enron is learning a costl y lessonnamely that investors are not responding favorably to the company s innovation especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis ed The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron as a good number of unre solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission SEC inquiry in to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company Lets first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t hird quarter As noted as a whole the company reported million in los ses after taking billion in charges associated with several of its n oncore businesses When we break down the losses it becomes clear that En ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses water broadband and the retail power market Specifically Enron reported million in charges from Azurix its water and wastewater business million in cha rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations including sever ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts and million in what the company is calling investment losses Evidently abou t half of the million figure is related to Enrons investment in NewPo wer Company the retail electricity and naturalgas provider that Enron lau nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM Enron owns percent of NewPower In addition Enrons debt to total capitalization r atio reportedly will increase to about percent although Lay says that p ending asset sales may reduce that amount to percent by the end of However it is important to note that Enrons Q recurring net income bef ore the writeoffs did increase percent to million or cents a diluted share and revenue in the quarter rose to billion from bi llion in Q The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting As one of the leading investors in the company Enron drove NewPowers aggressive bu siness focus on retail residential power sales despite ongoing concerns ab out the development of retail competition across the United States NewPowe r went public last year at an opening price of and in the early days o f its initial public offering was trading above that price However the co mpanys stock has experienced a devastating drop in value and is currently priced at NewPower is not scheduled to release its own Q financial statement until early November but it is expected that the company will c ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future Specificall y NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a Q loss of million to million or to a share Thirdquarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the million to million that the company had forecast in August In analyzing NewPowers Q financial losses see IssueAlert from at wwwscientechcomrci IssueAlert I argu ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re sidential and small business markets in the United States On the positive side NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp and DTE Energy These purchases prompted an impressive growth sp urt for NewPower and the company reportedly now has a customer base in markets in states However the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa ny operates This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better and t he companys stock has continued to drop as a result In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes NewPower recently rev ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp and several of i ts subsidiaries The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th rough Jan With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak e to Enron NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset based financing However from Enrons perspective the losses associated with NewPower and by the same token the losses in water and broadband have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price The message is clear The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole Further what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enrons p art has not translated into measurable profits and consequently Wall Stree t has reacted by sending Enrons stock to a level that is about half of whe re it was a year ago The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh at was a successful core business Further they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth The problem with Enron s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f iberoptic lines which has prevented the demand for the divisions service s from materializing as anticipated The problem with Azurix which has bee n losing money since its formation in is that privatization of the wa ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant icipated In addition to these problem areas Enron also faces challenges r elated to its investments in India where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government and California from which Enron has yet to rece ive full payment for previous power sales In addition to the losses outlined in the Q report there are new issues t hat are brewing at the start of this week First the SEC has requested tha t Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry However it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate d to the dealings of Enrons Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E nron Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SECs reque st In a separate development several mutual funds including AIM Constell ation that once held large positions in Enron have either liquidated or re duced their holdings in the company which has further weakened Enrons sto ck value Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enrons ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r emains on solid ground despite the losses Thus Lay has been quick to reit erate that earnings from the companys energy and gaspipeline business are still strong Further Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua rter should be seen as a way to clear away issues that have clouded the pe rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses Neverthele ss the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i ts diversification effort and in addition to water and broadband the compa ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well Thus se veral questions remain at this juncture Are the losses reported in the thi rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad ing Or will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and Moving forward will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably On ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En ron which is clearly a company in the midst of another

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg Facts Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN beat expectations in the third quarter repo rting that its earnings rose to million or cents per diluted share from million or cents per diluted share for the same period in This represented a percent increase from Q and boosted the c ompanys earnings estimate Dynegy has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about down from a week high of although it is important to note that for yearend the co mpanys stock was one of the top performers among Standard Poors com panies with a total shareholder return of percent Dynegy employs people Enron Corp NYSE ENE reported million in losses for the third quart er after taking billion in charges associated with several of its no ncore businesses The companys Q recurring net income before the write offs increased percent to million or cents a diluted share an d revenue in the quarter rose to billion from billion in Q Enron has a market capitalization of billion Its stock is currently trading at about which represents a sixyear low for the company an d is considerably lower than the peak of hit in August Enron empl oys people Analysis Dynegy closed out a banner year in and appears to still be o n a roll in terms of its financial performance In contrast Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil and is presently languishing in a low ebb characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp anys financial reporting While the two companies operate in the same mark et space of power trading and are fierce competitors Dynegyironically the younger and smaller of the two companiesis an industry success story whil e Enrons status remains rather uncertain The questions to be addressed in this article are What is Dynegy doing right What is Enron doing wrong What lessons can other power and naturalgas marketers learn from this tale of two companies Although they are often referred to as crosstown rivals Dynegy and Enro n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the singlem ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of Put more simply the two companies have vastly different strategies an dhindsight being a strong argument can be made that Dynegys strateg y is the winner at this juncture Throughout this article I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi ch the companies have expanded and invested into noncore sectors Both companies started out as naturalgas companies and converged into the power market in the s However that is essentially where their similar ities end and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid edly different paths In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary let me summarize the two paths this way Enron does not believe it needs t o own physical assets to be a success in the power and naturalgas trading sector Dynegy on the other hand not only believes in the ownership of ph ysical assets but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry Lets look at the companies separately Well discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul t to define but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers The participation and success in commodity markets according to Enron does n ot necessitate ownership of physical assets In fact the company has routi nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh olesale business Rather Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos ophy of risk management excellence in which it will merely buy and sell th e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues As an example Enron bought Portland General which owns MW of genera tion and kilometers of electric TD lines in as a way to launc h its penetration of the West Coast power markets When competition fizzled in that region Enron put Portland General back on the sales block a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing Like wise in Europe where it is one of the most prominent trading companies En ron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and unlike other US competitors has refrained from buying additional genera ting units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy According to its most recent K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Enron owns or controls MW of generating capacity including joint own erships which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector Dynegys approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr om Enrons In the words of CEO Chuck Watson Dynegys longterm strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets which supports earnings sustainability Ever since going public in Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge with each purchase significantly increasing its g eneration capability Dynegy presently owns or controls about MW of generating capacity in the United States gasprocessing plants and miles of pipelines which are located in geographically competitive area s The companys goal is to own or control MW or percent of the US market within the next five years Sometimes Dynegy has acquired ass ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy but just as often it has purchased assets independently Most notably when Dynegy a cquired Illinova in early the purchase doubled Dynegys generating ca pacity Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe wher e it is presently planning to purchase naturalgas storage facilities in En gland Dynegy executives have argued that naturalgas storage is the best w ay to back up a naturalgas trading operation Theres no question that the approach is working Out of the million that Dynegy reported in the t hird quarter million of it came from the companys main wholesale bus iness The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be tween Enron and Dynegy and its significance should not be overlooked It i s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegys approach Owning phys ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price In other words by controlling the actu al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region how much power can be produced to meet that load a nd when shortages might occur In addition in markets that are short on in frastructure it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region By t he same token those companies that do control physical assets often have g reater communication with grid operators and possible insight to spreads the difference between various energy prices In fact Dynegys CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t he volatility of price and being capable of resolving balances when shorta ges exist This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids Dynegys strategy of acquiring both naturalgas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities On the other side of this argument a case could be made that Enrons appro ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility Certainly by investing less in power generation facilities Enron has less capital o n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy Under a scenario when ma rket prices suddenly drop a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as setladen company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe d payments of a generation facility Assetheavy companies also may find th at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit ies in times of extreme price volatility As the industry becomes increasin gly focused on bottomline results this could be seen as a potential conce rn for investors Further some would argue that Enrons approach of establ ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility What E nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po rtfolio Consequently the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the g reat debate among power traders However although Dynegys overall perfor mance in the third quarter was better than Enrons that does not necessari ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegys strategy toward acquiring new ge neration facilities Keep in mind that Enrons Q losses resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges related to its noncore businesses broadband a nd water in particular Without these charges Enrons core wholesale trad ing business continues to perform well This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha s been quick to reiterate to investors Our percent increase in recurri ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who lesale and retail energy businesses and our naturalgas pipelines Lay sai d The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enrons leadi ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook Moreover perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets the key issu e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn ings in the third quarter is the companies approach to developing new line s of business Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point Enron which prides itself as usually gaining a firststrike advantage plunged i nto the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies Under the lead ership of thenCEO Jeffrey Skilling Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quic kly become lucrative Now Lay admits that the company could have gotten in to the broadband business with less capital and that Enron spent too much too soon in this sector Nevertheless Enron recorded an million non recurring writedown for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quar ter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by redu cing future costs in this sector to million a quarter Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t o Enron Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s ector but in the third quarter took a million loss in its broadband bu siness compared to the million loss that Enron reported However Dyneg y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities electricity and natural gas and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa y that merely supplements its core business It is also important to note that Enron gained the firststrike advantage w hen it developed EnronOnline an electronic trading exchange In fact Enro n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space well ahead of its competitors Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi rect The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha s recorded transactions that exceed in notional value Since its incep tion in November Dynegydirect has recorded billion in notional tr ansactions At this juncture Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting Enron which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enrons CFO To my rec ollection no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet and thus the companys status with investors is arguably more solid As I dont expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon my projection is that at least in the near term we will cont inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game A s noted the companys core business of wholesale business remains strong but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other noncore businesses Th at doesnt mean Enron is down permanently but it will have to find a way t o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous In many ways the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to rtoise and the hare parable I am sure you can guess which company is the t ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy The race between the two is far from over although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point based on i ts more methodical approach What will be fascinating to observe is how bot h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies

Site By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC signed off on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevadas Yucca Mountain to hold radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants Yet another step in a lon g approval process the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by the Department of Energy DOE The Bush administration must still submit t hat plan for congressional approval The DOE in August gave a favorable saf ety assessment to the proposed project which may face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen Harry Reid of Nevada the new Senate assistant majority leader Analysis This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the na tions repository for spent nuclear fuel but the NRC approval of the site could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress Since Sept new secur ity issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washi ngton DC pause and support ongoing efforts to block the site Neverthel ess after a decade of study planning commissions and public debate the N RC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will side on the issue For background since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted be lief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioact ive materials is to store them deep underground From this starting point the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in and charged t he DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials coul d be stored From the beginning it was understood that the NRC would need to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional approval would also be necessary In the DOE selected nine locations in six states for consideration as possible depositories and at that time President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive s cientific study known as site characterization The three locations were Hanford Wash Deaf Smith County Texas and Yucca Mountain Nev In Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to onl y study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location based on the finding from th e earlier report In other words since that time no other location besides Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nucl ear waste in the United States The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear e nergy and weapons has become increasingly limited The Bush administration s national energy plan released last April demonstrated strong support fo r the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources Thus the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considera bly in the near future and the location of an acceptable repository has be come a top priority for the federal government What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location According to the vast amo unt of research compiled over the last decade there are several characteri stics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository sit e it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population miles from Las Vegas it is located in a very dry climate with less than six inches of water per year and the location offers an extremely deep w ater table to feet below the level of the potential repository In addition Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air Force Range and the Nevada Test Site where atomicbomb tests once took pl ace Thus it is considered a very secure area Based on these characterist ics over the last years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioact ive waste Under the evolving plan the site reportedly would store underground thousa nds of tons of radioactive materials from the nations nuclear plants for a n estimated years Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be use d as the repository by but a delay in feasibility studies caused that date to be extended several times It is presently expected that assuming the site gains all the necessary approvals Yucca Mountain would be used a s a repository starting in However while scientists may have been generally in agreement reaching co nsensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult From a fe deral perspective President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository This belief has been sh ared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham However Nevada state leaders hav e demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the s torage of nuclear waste which has caused state federal conflicts for the last several years Specifically Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn and the Nevada A ttorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to usi ng Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire is sue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely considering the recent national events Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials In fact the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to is sue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate Nevada had gra nted water rights to the federal government but only for the study purpose s and not the actual use of the site The issue is still working itself thr ough various courts The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federa l court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized under federal law Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently out lined their concerns in public meetings Basically the top concern is that the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and in to the aboveground environment Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a fault line which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the po tential repository could be subject to shifting The location of Yucca Moun tain while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan has also bee n used by opponents as an argument against the plan Specifically opponent s say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor locate d about miles away and that a large number of military flights routine ly cross over the site In addition the events of Sept certainly have heightened concerns abou t potential targets for terrorist activity and despite reassurances from s cientists that the site is secure opponents believe that no site would be attackproof Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountai n The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsib le for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site because the transportation would be handled by private companies Critics of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the cou ntry The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the pre viously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca Mountain site All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will s ide with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and after n early two decades of study the pros of using this site outweigh the potent ial risks Regardless of the ultimate decision action on nuclear waste is necessary The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States However if we take the range of estima tes it would equate to a football field ranging from to feet deep T hat estimate takes into account all highlevel nuclear waste generated in t he United States since the start of a nuclear program in the s Compare d to other hazardous materials the amount of nuclear waste generated per y ear is very small In the United States all of the nuclear plants produce about tons of spent fuel a year whereas million tons of chemica l waste are generated per year

Rules May Set Continental Standard By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters USowned EntergyKoch Trading NYSE EKT is boo sting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands After a successful start we plan to subst antially increase our volume of European power power options and weather t rading next year said Uday Narang managing director of European trading EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in Fr ance and Austria although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Net herlands Analysis The announcement from EntergyKoch Trading that it will significa ntly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique In fact a recent scan of announcements from US power firms tells a similar story Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to stren gthen its European operations in an effort to replicate its strong US e nergy trading platform in Europe TXU said that it expects sharply higher profits this year from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent For the first nine months of TXU reportedly traded terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in con tinental Europe mostly in Germany which compared to terawatt hours in all of Further still UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity the fourthlarg est regional electric utility in the United Kingdom which in addition to miles of electric distribution lines owns a MW power plant The unrelated announcements have a common denominator US power firms are pl unging into the European energy trading market in droves despite some inhe rent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric compe tition among some European countries A new model in the United Kingdom kn own as the new energy trading agreement NETA rules appear to be facilita ting more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard acr oss the Continent The appeal of Europes power market for US energy companies is perhaps ob vious According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year de mand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional MW of generating capacity to b e built an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT i n Texas In addition like other developed areas of the world Europes en ergy consumption has grown over the last two years US power firms who p erhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country have expanded operations in Europe where electric privatization i s occurring on a countrybycountry basis Consequently the companies ment ioned above join Williams Enron Duke AEP and Mirant to name a few wh ich have established London trading offices Moreover many of the US power firms that expand into Europe start by acc umulating generation assets in the United Kingdom as represented by the Ut iliCorp and Dynegy announcements Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early s and completed the process in May after Norway but well ahead of ot her European countries However there is a more important reason why US energy firms may be drawn to UK power trading and that is related to th e areas unique rules for energy transactions which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules it is important to fi rst understand the context of the European market as a whole and the tradin g system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this ye ar The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition Toward this end the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches allowing endusers the right to select an alternative provi der giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power sup pliers transmission and distribution network otherwise known as thirdpar ty access and the introduction of energy trading which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market This last point is significant because some of the European countries have dismantled previo usly integrated stateowned utilities and mandated the divestiture of gene ration assets At the end of approximately percent of the European Union EU e lectricity market was open to competition Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries at least those that a re open That is the good news However the basic problem with this appro ach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the t ransition to a fully competitive marketplace and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables For instance Germany is fully privatized while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide thirdpa rty access to competitors In practice this often means that one country m ay have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neig hboring country may have not developed any standards at all The other prob lem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient which makes it difficult to transport power across borders As a result wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneo us and lacking in comprehensive trading standards The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for thirdparty acce ss to the national grids on the Continent While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved the U nited Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more ef ficient market because it offers one grid system one balancing and settlem ent code and one contract format However even the power trading market i n the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start Up until March of th is year the UK power market operated under a pool auction system Unde r that model generation companies offered electricity for sale which was then pooled into an auction system where dayahead bids were made and power was sold in halfhour increments The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive marke t for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight However the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for m arket manipulation Given the concerns with the pool format the United Kin gdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October which culminated in the NETA model that started this year The key tenets that ma ke NETA different from the previous pool model are Forwards and futures markets which allow participants to form power sale d eals using standardized contracts either ontheday or several years in adv ance as opposed to only dayahead bids More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers c an negotiate bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the Unite d Kingdom A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co operating in a role similar to an ISO which facilitates the var ious transactions to ensure reliability The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand rep resented by individual meters and the threat of strict penalties for part icipants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity In a nutshell NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power tradi ng in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming The system i mprovements have been successful and more international power firms appare ntly believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kin gdom due to the NETA rules Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a percent increase in the number of contracts traded a perce nt drop in wholesale prices and a sixfold increase in the variety of produ cts offered As of early summer about new participants had regist ered to participate under the NETA system as compared with about under the former model As noted many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the C ontinent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale m arkets to competition In addition to the UKs model there are several a ctive trading exchanges in Europe presently although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive The Nord Pool with about members organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures market s The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about members and operates a s pot market for electrical power Smaller European exchanges offering both spot and futures contracts include the Switzerland Exchange and Germanys Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt In the meantime I think we will conti nue to see additional US power firms expanding into the European trading market and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert

Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from PR Newswire Conectiv NYSE CIV an energy provider locat ed in the MidAtlantic announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Atlanti c City Electric Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in t hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company The ownership interests were sold for approximately million excluding re imbursement of estimated fuel inventory subject to adjustment Analysis This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week but I di d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development The transfer of ownershi p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b ecause of its relation to Conectivs unique competitive strategy and the ro undrobin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat es Further despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation s nuclear facilities we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectivs owne rship in the plants which Conectiv shares with other companies who also h appen to be the buying partners in this sale The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows A percent interest MW in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U nits and sold in equal shares to coowners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon Pri or to the transaction PSEG Nuclear an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi ce Enterprise Group Incorporated and Exelon each owned about percent of the Peach Bottom plant Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit y A percent interest MW in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un its and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which prior to the sale owned about percent of the facility PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla nt A percent interest MW in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U nits and was sold to PSEG Nuclear which is the operator of the plant a nd prior to the sale owned percent of the facility As noted the significance of these transactions relates to Conectivs comp etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector Lets look at Conectiv first According to Conectivs President and COO Thomas Shaw the divestiture of t he nuclear assets is consistent with the companys focused business strateg y on two core energy businesses Conectiv Energy the companys integrated generation and asset optimization group and Conectiv Power Delivery the c ompanys regulated delivery business To support this twotiered focus Con ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t o expand a generation portfolio that includes only midmerit plants units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns Midmerit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant s and peaker units Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent a midmerit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about percent to percent From Conectivs perspective the value of the midmerit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op erate only when demand is comparatively high Further the company believes that midmerit units are ideally suited to support the companys energy tr ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of MW of bas eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power Light a subsidiary of Conect iv to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectivs telecommunications busi ness Conectiv Communications to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond Va for million In addition Conectiv sold its percent stake in a MW co generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP a nonut ility electric generator for million Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own ership of some MW of midmerit generation in the MidAtlantic region The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r epay debt and fund Conectivs development of additional midmerit assets C onectivs immediate goal is to build more than MW of midmerit power generation within the MidAtlantic region by Toward that end Conecti v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon ey to support a million MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S tation which is currently a MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur al gas The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge neration supports Conectivs strategy of refocusing on its core businesses which are power trading and wholesale marketing through midmerit units only and a regulated delivery business Conectiv Power Delivery provides e nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey Delaware M aryland and Virginia Given the fairly distinct line between Conectivs re gulated and unregulated businesses I have previously speculated that Conec tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand alone company a trend represented by AEP Reliant and UtiliCorp Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring so it is unlikely that any such sp in off of its generation business would take place in the near term Howeve r as far as I know Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e xclusively on midmerit plants Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco a partnership t hat is scheduled to close in April In this deal Pepco is acquiring C onectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at billion Both co mpanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date The partnership between these two relatively small and regional ly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity d elivery company in the MidAtlantic region By combining their two electric ity delivery businesses Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doubl e their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times In the nuclear sector it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con ectiv despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj ority ownership in the plants Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclearpower space and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li cense exchange on these three plants Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind ustry owning a total of reactors Earlier this year Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years and did not rule out the fact that his company migh t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility As noted PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente rprise Group Inc which in was split into PSEG a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power an unregulated US power generation company As noted PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek NJ and oversees PSEG Powers ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station located in Delta Pa When the Conectiv transaction is completed PSEG Power will own percent of Hope Creek percent of Salem and percent of Peach Bottom In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear Entergy Corp is another company th at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector Since Enter gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block Recently Entergy bought Con Edisons Indian Point Unit s and nuclear power plants in Westchester County NY In addition Ent ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat ion to purchase the MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon Vt for million With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale Enterg y will own a nuclear fleet that includes reactors Also note that the Ne w York State Public Service Commission PSC just approved the sale of Niag ara Mohawks Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about million The purchase prices for the MW Nine Mile and percent of the MW Nine Mile are about million and mill ion respectively Constellation is another company that has consistently i ncreased its nuclear power assets Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate d with coalfired generation many industry analysts have debated whether o r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence Exelon for example is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR Supporters of PBMR believe its relatively small size MW anticipated short construction time months and cost kW can once again make nuclear power an acceptable option In February of Exelon filed an application with th e US nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United States

Analysis Constellation Energys stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven yearsdown nearly percent in one day and down over percent si nce May But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts E arlier in the week Allegheny Energy NYSEAYE announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering IPO of Allegheny Energy Supply Com pany its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary until market conditions improve The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for ces Constellation sited falling energy prices the changing nature of the California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo r dropping its companyseparation plans The company said it would now focu s on using its single status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S tates What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co mes from being a single company What has changed in the last one year i s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants the reasons are simple and profound The world has changed Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference call with the media The change in Constellations strategy will be costly The company will pay Goldman Sachs about million to terminate their powermarketing agreem ent million which Goldman had previously put in the business and million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti nued Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau se the company to record a million special expense in the fourth quart er The company said that its splitup with Goldman Sachs was amicable Gol dmans relationship with Constellation started in the midnineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business In Goldman agreed it would take a percent stake in Constellations trading business when the state of Maryl and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa rate trading company Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth er It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other significant announcements

Allegheny is confi dent that its yearend earnings will be within its guidance range of to per share Despite the strong earnings Alleghenys stock price has dropped over pe rcent since May and over

quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s elling off assets AES Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable longterm c ontract generation business By placing generating capacity into longterm contracts a company is able to provide

with the slowing economy mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices power demand for is flat or even down from one yea r ago in many parts of the country The recent actions of

Transformation Into Touch America By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from CBS MarketWatch Montana Power shares fell on Nov a da y after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter citing the slowdow n in the economy and the companys transition from a diversified energy com pany to a standalone telecommunications firm The stock fell to a week low of earlier in the session It closed Nov at down ce nts As of early morning trading on Nov Montana Power shares remained at Analysis There is little doubt that Montana Power currently finds itself a t a challenging crossroads The company remains in the midst of becoming so lely a telecommunications operation having sold off much of its utility ho ldings However the process has hit several snags including an incomplete transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to Northwestern Corp C ompounding Montana Powers current problems is a weakened financial perform ance which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the telecom business In addition the company faces a host of related challen ges including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for t he asset sale to Northwestern requests for rate increases to fund the purc hase of power that Montana Power must buy on the wholesale market and insp ection of the longterm powerpurchase contracts that the company has forme d with various suppliers The question that investors should be asking with regard to Montana Powers current plight is whether or not the financial l osses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or so me larger indication of doubt about the companys viability as a telecom op eration For its third quarter Montana Power posted a loss of million o r cents a share representing a million swing from its Q pro fit of million or cents a share During the third quarter of Montana Power had reported a net income of million Montana Power h as noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to Touch America but also included a million pretax writedown of inve stments in two other telecommunications companies One had filed for bankru ptcy and the other defaulted on loans that Montana Power had helped guarant ee In addition company officials have attributed the loss to price decrea ses and the slowing economy However note that the current thirdquarter l osses followed losses in the second quarter as well Specifically the comp any reported a net loss of million or cents a share in the Q compared with net income of million or cents a share in the second quarter of The company also previously reduced its expectation s of revenue growth in to percent from percent According to Mon tana Powers CEO Bob Gannon the company is merely experiencing a shortte rm liquidity problem Nevertheless to say that Montana Power is having some growing pains is an understatement Since March it has been Montana Powers goal to total ly divest all of its energy assets and reemerge as a debtfree communicati ons company operating under the name of Touch America presently the compa nys telecom subsidiary with zero debt million in cash and m iles of fiber communications lines CEO Gannon originally envisioned and c ontinues to see Touch America as one of the largest broadband companies in the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrat ed Montana Power Much of the transition has already taken place consideri ng that Montana Power has successfully divested its oil and gas coal and i ndependent power production businesses As noted the last piece of the puz zle is the sale of its electric and naturalgas utility operations to North western Corp a provider of electricity naturalgas and communications se rvices to Midwestern customers This is a big piece of the puzzle however as Touch America is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to sup port continued growth Therein lies one of the main challenges for Montana Power The Montana Publ ic Service Commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve t he sale of these assets Some analysts have suggested that Montana Powers financial problems can be resolved only if the Montana Public Service Commi ssion approves the sale of the electric and naturalgas distribution system s which could inject some million in Touch Americas operations Yet state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsels office wh ich represents ratepayers in utility cases and a group of large industrial electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed sale of the assets The less time provided for equalopportunity review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be cha llenged down the line After some early deliberation the Montana Public Service Commission has no w agreed to review the billion proposed sale of the assets to Northwes tern Corp by Jan although lawyers for Montana Power are still l obbying to have this review moved up to December Part of the pressure for the review the companys attorneys have argued is that if the sale is not approved by the end of the year investors and lenders may lose patience r egarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capi tal support into the growing Touch America Furthermore the viability of t he entire business plan for Touch America could be brought into question if this asset sale is not approved by state regulators considering that Mont ana Power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the ne w telecom company The sales agreement between Montana Power and Northweste rn Corp expires March so time is also a factor Another issue that has yet to be resolved is Montana Powers intent to rais e rates to support purchases of wholesale power In other words as a tange ntial issue related to the sale of its assets state regulators also questi on how Montana Power will recover certain powersupply costs as it continue s to morph into a telecom business The company has established that it exp ects to pay nearly billion over the next years for wholesale power pu rchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company from a utility holding company and hopes to increase electric rates by percent to support these expenses Montana Power is still considered the de fault provider to about customers and needs an average of MW f or its customers However the company also needs to keep a total of MW as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep MW of reser ve power Since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to PPL Corp it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by the Montana Public Service Commission The percent rate increase reporte dly would increase residential electricity rates by about a month sta rting in July making the average bill about per month In additio n to the projected percent increase for residential customers Montana P ower estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by p ercent and medium industrial customers could see a percent increase It is important to note that a recent survey by the Great Falls Tribune conclu ded that the increase in Montana Powers rates would produce some of the h ighest residential electric rates in the Northwest Montana Power is attempting to establish longterm power contracts with sup pliers to meet its entire load requirements For instance Montana Power fo rmed a buyback agreement with PPL as a condition of the generation sale tw o years ago This contract expires July Beyond that date Montana Power announced that it signed a oneyear contract to buy MW from Duke Energy at an undisclosed price PPL also has formed a new contract to provi de MW to Montana Power over a fiveyear period after its current contra ct expires Northwestern Power the purchaser of Montana Powers distributi on system has said that it wants Montana Power to assemble a diverse packa ge of powerpurchase deals instead of buying all its load from one source to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region Mont ana Power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of powerpurchase deals to t he Montana Public Service Commission to determine the inclusion of those de als within the rate structure and the portfolio contains about threefourt hs of the MW that Montana Power will need to cover its peak demand of customers and maintain an adequate reserve The company will probably purc hase the balance of its requirements on the shortterm market Also on the legal front Montana Power continues to navigate through at le ast two litigious proceedings First in August a group of Montana Power s hareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility claiming the companys effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them billion in lost stock value The complaint filed in the District Court at Butte said the sale of Montana Power generation plants to PPL Montana in December was done without the required shareholder approval and should be overturned The suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and an estimated million in profits realized by PPL from operating the pl ants into a trust until the case is resolved What this means is that the s ale of Montana Powers generation assets are in a state of litigation even though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago Anot her lawsuit is related to Montana Powers million purchase last year o f Qwest Communications longdistance and other telephone businesses within a state service area Essentially Montana Power has launched a suit ag ainst Qwest alleging that Qwest has violated antitrust laws and constrain ed competition in the longdistance and voice and data market Consequently as Montana Power closes out the year and hits the twoyear ma rk in its transformation into Touch America the future for the company loo ks rather questionable Although there are market doubts about the future o f the telecom sector Montana Power remains confident that its longterm pr ospects as a telecom company remain very strong Nevertheless the current question for investors is how quickly and how successfully Montana can comp lete its transformation into Touch America In other words what Montana Po wer sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached The path to the compa nys final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal o bstacles An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look forward to hearing from you Nancy

Strategies of Both Compani es By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PR Newswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU has agreed to sell its MW coalfired West Burton power station near Retford Nottinghamshire England to London Electricity Group for GBP million US millio n In another transaction TXU also announced the sale of Eastern Electric ity its UK distribution business and its percent interest in seven the company that operates and maintains the distribution network to Lond on Electricity for GBP billion US billion London Electrici ty a distribution company that serves three million customers across Brita in is a subsidiary of Electricite de France EDF the stateowned and lar gest energy firm in France London Electricity already owns the other pe rcent of seven Analysis Its rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two ener gy companies involved in the transaction but that appears to be the case i n this deal between TXU and EDF Both companies are pursuing different stra tegies but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their respective niches in the European market The transfer of both TXUs gener ating station and the entire distribution business in the United Kingdom to the French conglomerate EDF should help both companies increase market sha re in their respective markets The divestiture enables TXU to obtain its g oal of accumulating a total of about billion in available capital to gro w its energy merchant business across Continental Europe For EDF which ai ms to gain percent of the market in Britain the sale solidifies the com panys position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its generation assets both through its London Electricity subsidiary Althou gh the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies one stu mbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingerin g frustration over EDFs expansion in other countries while the French mark et remains comparatively restricted Before moving on to the individual strategies of TXU and EDF lets establi sh what is included in the current transactions As noted the sale of the generation assets includes only the coalfired West Burton plant for which London Electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue gas desulphurization process The transaction also includes a longterm con tract for TXU to supply the station with coal TXU Europes distribution bu siness is actually the largest in the United Kingdom and includes the asse ts and wires that deliver electricity through a mile network in East Anglia and southeast England Both transactions must obtain regulatory app roval from the European Union and US regulators may review the sales as well Lets now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these t ransactions TXU Corp First it is important to note that the European expansion of Dallasbased TXU Corp is driven by the companys TXU Europe subsidiary TXUs divestitu re of its UK power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company h as been pursuing for over a year In a nutshell TXU Corp has sought to ga in billion from selling off nonstrategic assets owned by TXU Europe to support further growth of the companys core trading and merchant energy bu sinesses across the Continent In February TXU Europe announced the s ale of its gasfield assets in the North Sea to Consort Resources which wa s the first indication that the company was moving away from a hardasset s trategy TXU believes it only needs to have access to power supply through various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in Europ e Toward this end TXU Europe also recently announced the sale of its p ercent stake in Spains Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico In June TXU complet ed the divestiture of its MW Rugeley coalfired power station to Inte rnational Power In August TXU sold two gasfired power plants in Eastern England totaling MW to Centrica a British gas and home services supp lier for million Under the current sale of its UK assets TXU exits the regulated pipes an d wires business in the United Kingdom and gains available capital to suppo rt further growth in its trading business across the Continent Specificall y from both sales TXU reportedly will reach its total of billion in ava ilable financial resources and substantially exceed its previously establis hed GBP billion debtreduction target In other words proceeds from the sales reportedly will allow TXU to strengthen its financial position by red ucing debt and TXU says it expects to cut its net debttocapital ratio to percent by early However the sale of the distribution assets inc ludes a onetime writeoff of million that TXU is taking associated wi th transaction and debt restructuring The writeoff has caused TXU to redu ce its earnings by cents a share The company now expects to earn b etween to a share next year With the divestiture proceeds in hand TXU Europes primary business model will remain focused on energy trading a market in which the company holds a topthree position throughout the Continent Further the asset sales ext ricates TXU from the distribution sector which it acknowledges is a busine ss that provides lower returns and declining profitability The bottom line for TXU in this and related sales is to recycle capital into the faster g rowing merchant energy business in the words of TXU Europes CEO enablin g the company to derive more than threefourths of its subsequent proceeds from this business It is important to note that TXU Europe includes genera ting trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy merchant operations TXU Europe will probably remain involved in Britains retail market where the company retains the powersupply contract to serv e million customers but the company is no longer interested in the dis tribution sector of this market Moreover it is clear that energy trading is now the core of TXUs European operations TXU Europe holds a trading volume of approximately GWh an d earlier in the parent company TXU Corp reported a percent jump i n its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading busin ess both in Europe and the United States TXU Europe still hopes to contro l physical assets in Europe as represented by its purchase this year of a percent state in Germanys Kiel utility which in terms of volumes and c ustomer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in Germany However it is clear that TXU is moving out of the UK power distribution market and its sights are more clearly focused on Continental Europe Upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the ne xt three years TXU shares fell about percent on Nov to close at In early morning trading on Nov TXU shares were priced at However Wall Street analysts indicate that the sales should increase TXU s longterm attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acqui sitions enabled by these sales Electricite de France As noted London Electricity is buying the generation and distribution asse ts from TXU but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by the Frenchgovernment owned Electricite de France Londons Electricitys parent company EDF which still maintains a practical monopoly status in F rance purchased London Electricity in for million British pounds billion from Entergy Corp Based on comments from EDF over the last year the company plans on expanding its products and services and investi ng in further strategic alliances to become a multienergy company In fact London Electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the companys strategy to consolidate its position within the United Kingdom Thus while the UK market no longer appears to be a core focus of TXU it obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a m arket share in Europe Upon completion of the transactions EDF London El ectricity will increase its share of the UK generation market to perc ent from percent and reduce the gap that currently exists between its market share of generation versus distribution in the United Kingdom Londo n Electricity already owns the Cottam power station a MW coalfired generating plant located near the West Burton plant However London Electr icity will still own far less generation capacity in the United Kingdom whe n compared to the market leaders Powergen which controls MW and In nogy which controls about MW Thus the true focus of these purchases by London Electricity may be on the distribution sector Upon completion of the transactions London Electrici ty will own Britains largest power distribution network and control about percent of the countrys distribution business Analysts have suggested that EDF overpaid for TXUs West Burton plant the buying price represented a percent premium over the plants book value but got a fair price fo r the distribution assets The point here may be that EDF was arguably will ing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock on distribution in the United Kingdom and is attempting to expand further b y gaining control over generation assets Representatives from London Elect ricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top five players in the United Kingdom and have a goal of gaining percent o f market share in the region London Electricity has been named as a conten der for the UK supply company Seaboard which current owner AEP plans to put for sale next year Seaboard serves around two million customers in Eng land in the towns of Kent Sussex and Surrey The involvement in EDF in this UK expansion has added a renewed spark to an old debate namely the growth of EDF into other European countries while competition in France remains comparatively restricted In other words ED F has been the target of intense criticism across Europe for the last sever al years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have a rgued that EDF has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely pro tecting its own turf For instance while Germany has opened percent of its power market to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and Au gust respectively While France remains rather blocked EDF has freel y admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in England Spain Ital y and possibly the United States This dichotomy may become a factor as th e current transactions with TXU fall under review of the European Union An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission F ERC kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r ules requiring utilities to turn control of their powergrid assets to inde pendent management The controversial effort to carve up the nations elect ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat ions RTOs is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III The workshop s dubbed RTO Week were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls buy in for the effort which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie s state regulators and members of Congress Analysis The objective of this weeks workshops may be to gain support fro m the industry for FERCs controversial mandate but they are also having t he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERCs jurisdic tional boundaries The issue has become rather evenly divided On one side critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order which as noted has become somewhat of a cause clbre for new Chairman Wood O n the other hand supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s uppliers into the nations transmission system By Woods own directive th e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin g point as a Dec deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u tilities is fast approaching Certainly the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman after replacing Curt H bert last month has signaled a new era for the federal commission which oversees much of the energy industrys wholesale market and the nations po wer grid As noted Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key objectives Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec by which time transmis sionowning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities Using what he has referred to as a big stick Wood warned that failing to comply with the D ec deadline would cost transmissionowning utilities their right to cha rge marketbased rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in which the utilities might become engaged This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand but has also sparked an inte nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul ating energy market Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints on FERCs authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional leaders who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers State regulators p articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ ely low argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is S uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight rather than c ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC and also believe t hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n ations transmission system is managed Also in question is the extent to w hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen d state boundaries Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERCs authority to force it to participate in an RTO In its July order FERC directed Southern Comp any along with the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Corp and Grid South to form a single RTO for the Southeast region most likely adopting a structur e modeled after Grid South However Southern Company already has sunk abou t billion into its own mile system over which it wants to retain independent control FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced However Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co uld run as high as million which could be passed on to customers in t he form of higher rates Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph ical point of view and questions whether or not the commissions vision of four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient On e of Southerns concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la rge and end up operating like monopolies Ironically the issue has caused dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant which as an i ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid Whil e Southern disagrees with FERCs authority to force RTO participation Mira nt supports the federal governments efforts to streamline transmission act ivity Leaders of RTO Westthe transmission entity in which FERC wants to include the transmission assets of states in the Northwest Southwest and Californi aalso question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC s authority to mandate this structure Leaders in the region have said tha t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates con sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity to meet high demand in the area In other words although FERC may be endor sing marketbased rates for those transmissionowning utilities that join R TOs some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre ased activity Nevertheless along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D ynegy and Enron which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems Hence t hese companies agree with FERCs emphasis on RTO formations as generation companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f rom utilities to independent management companies In addition to the RTO issue the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas E lectric Co have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio nal authority to a head The utilitys parent PGE Corp is pursuing a rin g fencing strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi ngs of Pacific Gas Electric Co Put simply PGE Corp is trying to prote ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new federally regulat ed subsidiary The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca use the California Public Utility Commission which presently regulates the utility operations of Pacific Gas Electric Co believes that it has the right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary Further th e state government in California believes that PGE Corps plan would give too much regulatory control to FERC and by the same token reduce the amou nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr esently contained in a regulated subsidiary The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder al legal system In fact last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen ts from federal lawyers state regulators and private industry addressing not only FERCs authority to mandate RTOs but also the commissions or der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s ystems Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat ion in an RTO At present the commission had danced around the issue by ca lling for voluntary participation yet still affixing stiff penalties for utilities that refuse to comply In addition Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the Energy and Air Qual ity Subcommittee is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session which cou ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl y November Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs and his draft bill repor tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr ivate utilities that own power lines At the same time however it is beli eved that Bartons draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERCs order which again w ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on transmission issues Moreover Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d ebate over FERCs authority as disputes between state and federal regulator y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge Howe ver given FERCs deadline of Dec for RTO participation the issue has gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in their heels and rebuff the federal commissions mandate An

and European leaders agreed to disagree over a glob al warming treaty as the president sought to reassure allies that sharp polic y differences would not hamper relations between Europe and the United States During several closeddoor sessions Bush and his European counterparts confronted one of their most contentious areas of disagreement the presidents rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming We agreed t o disagree Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters The Europe an Union is sticking to the Kyoto Protocol The United States has chosen anoth er policy Analysis It is rather amazing how prominently energy issues have factored into the first six months of the Bush administration In contrast to the eight years of the Clinton administration when energy policy often took a backseat to other concerns President BushFa result of California blacko uts a national shortage of natural gas skyhigh electricity prices and a controversial energy task planFbeen comparatively consumed by energy iss ues Now in a political legacy from the previous administration President Bush finds himself grappling with another contentious energy problem that has global ramifications Departing from what appears to be an international consensus President Bush has declared the Kyoto Protocol an ineffective treaty and has instead decided to further examine the greenhouse gas proble m which has raised further questions about the presidents commitment to environmental issues First let me provide some background The Kyoto Protocol developed out of meetings held in December in Kyoto Japan during which time the Unite d Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in principle to a series of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions About governments of various countries including the United States participated in the Protocol and agreed to reduce their aggregate carbon dioxide CO equivalent emissions by at least percent below levels by Noticeably exempt from the Protocol were developing countries such as China and IndiaFof the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the worldwhich resisted taking on any sort of formal reduction plan until industrialized countries proceeded with their own This marked the central flaw in the Protocol in that participants such as Europe Japan and the United States argued that it would be impossible to reach the Protocols goals without th e active and controlled participation of developing countries Consequently the United States could not garner twothirds support from the Senate whic h would be required to ratify the Protocol despite endorsement from the Clinton administration The United States is the largest emitter of CO accounting for onequarter of the world total per year and thus its participation in the Protocol has been considered essential The Protocols emissions targets include all major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide NOx and greenhouse gases created by industrial processes which are artificial chemicals called halocarbons CFCs HFCs and PFCs and longlived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride SF The Protocol requires the main developed countries to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gases by varying amounts percent for Europea n Union countries percent for the United States and percent for Japan With the onset of his new administration President Bush announced last Mar ch that the United States would not support the Kyoto Protocol again arguing that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic Further Bush has voiced the concern that ratifying the Protocol would severely damage the US economy as it would restrict industrial production The president has also pointed out that although European nations espouse support for the Protocol none of the EU members has yet to ratify the treaty Instead President Bush has adopted a goslow approach toward global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem and work with other nations to produce a better plan A new report from the National Academy of Sciences requested by the Bush administration found that global warming is indeed occurring as the result of human activity Specifically the report found that the Earths temperatures could rise between and degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century On the other hand the report could not reliably establish ho w much of the warming trends result from natural variations how fast future warming will occur or how corrective actions might correct it Thus the president asserted that these unanswered questions warranted further investigation into the greenhouse gas problem The president has come under fire both domestically and abroad for what is perceived as a policy that gives preference to business over the environmen t In addition to his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol President Bush also announced in March that he opposes any domestic restrictions in CO emissio ns from the nations power plants retracting on a pledge that he had made during his campaign Carbon dioxide is not classified as a pollutant by the Clean Air Act and thus the White House said that Bushs original promise w as a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production Toward that end the Bush administration has focused on the construction of some new power plants across the count ry to resolve a growing supply demand imbalance On the other hand business groups have applauded the presidents approach echoing his belief that the Protocol would harm the nations economy and that domestic technologybase d solutions represent a better solution This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th e debate I wont use this space to criticize or defend President Bushs environmental stand Instead I think it will be useful to clearly identify the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto Protocol European leaders have vowed to enact the Protocol without the United States which may not be possible The Protocol can only be enacted if nations that produced percent of the industrialized worlds carbon dioxi de in decide to ratify it Japan could be the wild card in the debate as it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it I f Japan does participate proponents of the Protocol would have percent of emissions enough for ratification Nevertheless here is how the two approaches shake out The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside nt Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal expected some time th is summer in a recent radio address With new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment the president said The Bush administrations previously released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nations energy supply through the expedited construction of new generation including nuclear power plants Further the president has said that energy production and environmental protection are not competing priorities and c an both be achieved with new technology While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions for limiting CO emissions from existing or new plants the new technology to which he has referred most likely includes cleancoal technologies that can be implemented to reduce emissions from coalfired plants As noted in the IssueAlert new cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed by various companies throughout the United States One example is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More tha n percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada As coal remains the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves muc h of the nations plan for reducing emissions will focus on coalfired generation It is important to note however that most of the cleancoal technologies currently being developed eliminate SO pollutants and NOx bu t may do little to address CO emissions which is the primary focus of the Kyoto Protocol President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi ve years and help developing nations such as China and India to match the US commitment The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has said that the European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the Kyoto Protocol As noted the participation of another large industrialized country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol If the Protocol is enacted an international conference will be held in Bonn Germany this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b e reached Toward this end French President Jacques Chirac recently commente d that Now is not the time to conduct new studies These studies have alrea dy been done We have to set objectives Specifically European countries wil l proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc h as CO produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels The EU has said that if ratified it will comply with the Protocols standards for emissio ns reduction by and go significantly further to reduce emissions beyond that date Yet interestingly across the Continent nuclear power which produces no CO emissions has undergone a resurgence and presently generat es an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and Germany However we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio ns that took place during the Clinton administration Most of the emissions targets of the participating countries will be reached through emissiontrading mechanisms Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price commonly agreed In other words industrialized countries that do not meet emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d o better than required This may encourage reductions to be made where they a re most needed However critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant reductions Moreover the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe an Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse gases There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan d and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol Without US participation the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large industrialized country such as Japan decides to join On his own President Bush now moves forward with constructing a plan for the United States that attempts to balance the reduction of emissions while aggressively expanding the countrys generation supply This will be a difficult balance to achiev e but the president remains confident that environmental protection and industrial expansion do not need to be mutually exclusive An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEOwners of transmission systems across Alabama Florida Georgia Mississippi and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding MOU to develop a regional transmission organization RTO f or the Southeast A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end of this article Two of the largest members of this new organization are Southern Company NYSE SO and Santee Cooper If the transmission owners prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity the RTO would be one of the nations largest covering more than miles o f transmission with an investment in assets in excess of billion Analysis The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern Company However the development of this muchanticipated RTO illustrates how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating answers questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives a nd raises speculation about possible impact on the regions alreadyestablishe d RTO GridSouth Further as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the country much of the commissions focus has been placed on the Southeastern United States along with the West The Southeast is dominated by large IO Us that control massive transmission assets Thus seeing that Southeastern transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for FERC You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo rm its own RTO the organization that will manage a transmission network withi n a particular region FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth er than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy In addition it is FERC s general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country and the commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous if it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity Thus FERC unequivocally told Southern Company to not reapply for RTO status until it had explored joining forces with neighboring companies Simultaneously FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth an RTO formed by Carolina Power Light Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas SCANA Southern Companys neighbors to the north The conditional approva l came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the SeTrans Gridco Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority TVA about joining GridSouth Again FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to see a single large RTO serving the entire Southeast region Nevertheless now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit h seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate entity from GridSouth I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what impact if any the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on GridSouth However as of press time representatives for GridSouth had not prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity I spoke with John Sell a Southern Company spokesperson on June Sell informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with GridSouth upon FERCs directive but determined that GridSouth was too far down the road in terms of its development and that Southern Company plann ed on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets For instance while both entities are forprofit operations the new Southeast RTO plans to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Further althoug h the term Southeast RTO is being used in the press release Sell told me that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as SeTrans the name of Southern Companys rejected entity Sell stressed tha t the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern has majority power over the RTO In fact the name will be changed to something else later this year On a related note one statement that I found particularly interesting in t he press release about the new RTO is that the companies have also made it clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi on owner but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which they will operate and make decisions This is clearly a veiled reference t o Southern Company which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in its original RTO filing When I spoke with John Sell he volunteered that Southern is not the driver behind this RTO Santee Coopers involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha t precarious fashion As noted FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w ay to incorporate Santee Cooper a stateowned utility located in South Carolina into its RTO As Santee Cooper controls about miles of transmission lines covering percent of South Carolina it is no wonder that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was conjoined in some way to developing RTOs There was just one problem with this plan the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from joining forprofit enterprises The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi c power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations to join RTOs New reports indicate that if the SeTrans RTO is approved by FERC it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power entity However it is important to note that Desert Star an RTO based in Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states includes the Western Area Power Administration WAPA which owns about onethird of the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to of of the states municipal electric systems Naturally as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a forprofit entity th e question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a member given the South Carolina law I spoke with Stephen Pelcher associat e general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper about this conundrum There is an important distinction that should be understood GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents Caroli na Power Light Duke and SCANA The obstacle facing Santee Coopers participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder in a private corporation Under the SeTrans RTO in which Santee Cooper is now a participant none of the participating companies will have ownership over t he transmission entity As noted this was one of Southern Companys main interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Pelcher told me that the SeTrans RTO is still in a preliminary stage and thus it appears at this time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe nt third party Interestingly Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper and b y extension the SeTrans RTO remains in consultation with GridSouth for a coordination and implementation service agreement that would in some way interconnect the two entities One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems Specifically FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o ne RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO s could become speed bumps in the flow of electricity In fact the commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy related to these seam issues Part of the reason that Southern Companys original independent RTO plan was rejected was FERCs concern that the utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive interconnected system in the region At this point it appears that FERC favors standardization in h ow adjacent RTOs will relate to each other and thus has instructed developing RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements FERC reportedly is planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this year Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether or not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist Thus as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow it will need to determine how i t will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida and any other adjacent RTOs In addition Southern Companys John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement At this point TVA has made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and in fact as a federal agency is under no obligation to join an RTO The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for the commissions deadline of being formed by Dec of this year If the SeTrans RTO or whatever it is ultimately called gains FERCs approval it will represent a significant part of the Southeasts development into a functionally competitive electric market If FERCs stated policy of consolidating RTOs is effectively applied ultimately we could see that GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO which now includes Southern Company Santee Cooper and through a seam agreement TVA Moreover the development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of conjoining companies that transcend federal state and municipal levels

Editors Note Yesterdays IssueAlert incorrectly identified Las Cruces as the town used for an energy management pilot project The correct town is Laredo Texas IMAGE IssueAlert for February Florida Study Recommends Wholesale Deregulation by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Floridas political and business leaders moved cautiously toward deregulati ng the states electric industry in a move last week while vowing to avoid problems such as those in California Floridas Energy Study Commissio n unanimously recommended that the Florida Legislature consider deregulating wholesale electricity The move could spark construction of a number of pow er plants in the state Analysis Florida Gov Jeb Bush created the Energy Study Commission wi th the intent of submitting an initial deregulation proposal for consideration in this springs legislative session Floridas energy market represents a billion industry so obviously there has been great interest on the par t of new energy suppliers that want to begin serving the state Florida continues to move slowly toward deregulation across all levels Competition on the retail side may take several more years especially as t he California crisis is causing many states to adopt a more cautious approach to removing state regulations The commissions recommendation to initiate deregulation on the wholesale side is considered a small step toward reachi ng the ultimate goal of total deregulation in the state Specifically the commission has endorsed a plan that would allow outofstate companies to build new merchant power plants in Florida and se ll wholesale electricity to the states utilities Florida law forbids outofstate electric utility companies from providing yearround service t o utilities and customers but merchant plants can provide backup service to existing utilities when energy reserves are stretched thin to avoid power outages and rolling brownouts Also under the commissions plan instate utilities would also be allowed to sell their regulated plants at depreciat ed values to affiliated companies that would compete headtohead on the wholesale market In addition the states utilities could engage in longterm power contracts with suppliers instead of relying on the open market a major difference from Californias original plan and state regulators would still review all wholesale contract prices The commission s plan must still be approved by the Florida Legislature and the commission readily admits that approval may not be easily obtained due to the ongoing crisis in California At the present time no official start date for electric competition in Florida has been announced The states go slow approach is characteristi c of other Southeastern US states many of which continue to enjoy comparatively low electric rates Floridas renewed interest in deregulatio n is being driven by the belief among several commission members and other officials that competition eventually will result in lower rates for consumers Or at the very least competition should prevent rates from continuing to increase as they reportedly would under a regulated structure The commissions plan also is intended to prevent power supply problems in Florida similar to those in California by allowing for new generation to b e built in the state by external companies Florida law requires power companies to hold percent of their power supplies in reserve to that the y can handle periods of extreme usage However both the commissions chair a nd Gov Bush have suggested that Florida will face a shortage of electricity i n the next decade unless outofstate companies build new plants Consumer groups and municipal electric providers have resisted the commissions recommendation In general such groups fear that deregulating Floridas wholesale market would lead to higher electricity bills since big utilities in the state would be allowed to earn higher profits that may or may not result in benefits for consumers In fact the Florida Municipal Electric Association recently argued that annual electricity prices in Florida would rise by between million and billion if the commissions plan to initiate wholesale deregulation is approved In addition Floridas utilities have been rather effective in persuading stat e officials to move slowly toward deregulation perhaps out of concern about losing their monopoly status Walter Revell the chairman of the Energy Study Commission denied that the group is considering any plan that would be partial to the states largest investorowned utilities which include Florida Power Light Tampa Electric Florida Power Corp and Gulf Power The commissions recommendation supports what is already a fastgrowing wholesale business in the state of Florida with outside power companies su ch as Duke Enron Calpine Corp and others aggressively trying to penetrate t he state and gain a foothold for when deregulation emerges in full force Such power suppliers may be accurately surmising that Florida is headed toward a supply demand imbalance as has occurred in California An imbalance of this sort would offer competitive opportunities for power suppliers in the state According to a report in the St Petersburg Times merchant power companies have announced plans to build some plants across Florida just over the last year or so However the article stated that the Floridas bi g utility companies still have enough clout to block any plant proposal For instance Florida Power Florida Power Light and Tampa Electric joine d forces last year to block Duke Energy from constructing a plant near Dayton a Beach Yet Duke pushes forward and recently said that it would revive plan s to build a merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach Fla Dukes plans to build t he plant had previously been blocked by a Florida Supreme Court ruling that su ch plants were prohibited under state law Enron unveiled plans for two peaker plants in Pompano and Deerfield Beach Fla several weeks ago Construction on both sites is pending city and sta te environmental department approval but Enron hopes to have both MW facilities running by summer Enron expects the Department of Environmental Protection to license each peaker plant for days each yea r with roughly days powered by natural gas and the rest by oil Enron is also in the preliminary stages of planning a mile liquefied natural gas LNG pipeline between the Bahamas and Port Everglades Fla The company ha s an option on a acre site in the harbor of Grand Bahamas Island where it hopes to build a conversion and treatment terminal for LNG Calpine received approval to build a MW natural gasfired plant to supp ly electricity to Seminole Electric Cooperative The plant will be part of the proposed Osprey Energy Center in Aurburndale Fla next to an existing Calpine MW cogeneration plant According to Calpine beginning in June Seminole Electric Cooperative will distribute electricity from Osprey for years to member electric cooperatives Reliant Energy is also finding its own way to penetrate the new openings in to the Florida market Just last week Reliant Energy Services an unregulated wholesale power subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced that it has entered into agreements with affiliates of El Paso Energy Corp to purchase future supplies of power from several new facilities to be built in Florida Under the tolling agreements Reliant Energy Services has secured the right to utilize and dispatch electric generating capacity totaling approximately MW The electricity will be generated by two new naturalgas fired simplecycle peaking plants to be owned by El Paso Energy that will be located in Pasco and Hardee counties The new plants are scheduled to be completed by the spring and summer of These are just a few examples of the many companies that plan to take competitive advantage of the anticipated opening of Floridas market While Florida clearly has no plan to open deregulation on the consumer level any time soon competition in the state does appear to be gaining momentum at least on the wholesale level Of course the commissions plan has not yet been fully approved by the Florida Legislature and critics claim that the states big utilities still wield a great deal of influence over the extent to which competing power suppliers will be allowed to participate in the states market There are many debatable nuances within the Florida commissions plan Yet one positive thing is that Florida does appear to b e making valuable steps to increase its own power supply addressing a proble m that many have accused California of ignoring Having learned the lesson fr om California Florida seemingly acknowledges that there is simply no guarante e that power will be readily available at tolerable price levels on the open market Thus this plan to increase the availability of power supply within the state through increased merchant plants seems to be a prudent approach An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a sponsorship of

Analysis News Item from The Washington Post March President Bush has decided n ot to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide CO emissions of the nations power plants reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli es on Capitol Hill In a letter to four Republican senators Bush cited a rece nt Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO emissions would result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs I do not believethat the government should impose on power plants mand atory emissions for carbon dioxide Bush said Analysis The sudden change in President Bushs position on CO emissions naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate The extent to which CO contributes to the nations pollution and whether or n ot the government should take an active role in restricting CO emissions has become an intensely politicized issue Democrats and environmental groups responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bushs decision will ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy I wont attempt to debate the political aspects of the presidents decision Rather I will analyze Bushs current position impacts the energy industry and whether or not the lifting of COrestrictions does indeed contribute to a sound energy policy It is true that during his campaign the president made promises to limit C O emissions In a speech in late September Bush said With the help of Congress environmental groups and industry we will require all power plan ts to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time Yet while many critics have claimed that Bushs refusal to place limits on CO is a philosophical turnabout White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that carbon dioxide should not have been included as a pollutant in Bushs campaign position because it is not classified as one in the Clean Air Act Further the White House has said that Bushs original promise was a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production In fact although many scientists believe that CO is a key contributor to global warming it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human health Consequently CO has never been classified as a pollutant under th e Clean Air Act because in the eyes of those determining Clean Air classifications it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact except as it applies to concerns about global warming In his decision to abstain from placing any restrictions on CO emissions Bush noted the incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of and solutions to global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f or removing and storing carbon dioxide The president maintains that he is committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality emissions of NOx SO and mercury which are already regulated as pollutant s but not CO Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce emissions from power plants specifically but that any such strategy would include phasedin reductions and marketbased incentives to help the indust ry meet the targets Moreover the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio ns on CO emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on domestic power supply Clearly any limits on CO emissions would have tremendous impact on coalburning power plants By some estimates coal a relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than percent of the electricity generated in the United States produces about percen t of the nations CO output more than any other fuel Yet industry officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO emissio ns would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production Since Bush took office as president in January it has become increasingly clear that a major component of the presidents imminent energy plan will be efforts to increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa l natural gas and nuclear The president has maintained that he sees a supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar However according to reports out earlier this week Bush is proposing to cut the DOEs renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by to percent In any case establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time and the president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis resulting from a growing supply demand imbalance Aside from power supply concerns the president also acknowledged the curre nt high prices for natural gas and how a reduction in coalfired generation would most likely keep prices at their high levels In fact the president said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba ck away from CO restrictions more than any pressure he might have received from oil and coal lobbying groups as has been reported in many recent news articles Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO emissions would have led to significantly higher electricity prices The translation of this is that if restrictions were to be placed on coalburning plants many power suppliers would turn to naturalgas production as an alternative Naturalgas supplies are already compromised in this country due to increasing demand which has driven prices up to unprecedented levels Bushs decision reflects the concern that if power suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers this wi ll continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high This is important new information that warrants a reevaluation especiall y at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage President Bush said The DOE report also indicated that because coalfired power plants are the major power sector emitters of CO compliance with the emission caps would be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production both nationally and regionally If COcaps were to be put into place substantia l reductions in coal consumption would result according to the DOE with corresponding drops in the projections for coal production Further becaus e coal has a carbon content more than percent higher per Btu than that of natural gas the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to CO caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants uneconomical In addition to the DOE report Bush continues to be counseled by an energy advisory team including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party Many Republican senators including Jesse Helms North Carolina and Chuck Hagel Nebraska expressed alarm over Bushs campaign promises to reduce CO emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying an international treaty regarding pollution control The Kyoto Protocol negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified would commit industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO along with SO and NOx emissions Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last November but are expected to resume this July If ratified the Protocol would limit CO emissions below levels Currently CO emissions in th e United States are about percent over levels Reportedly Sens Helm s and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be directed by an international treaty It is important to note how the presidents new stand on CO emissions relates to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Just two weeks ago t he US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air However the EPA does not currently regulate CO emissions EPA Administrator Christine Whitman in a series of public statements had vehemently defended and supported President Bushs previously espoused commitment to controlling CO emissions Meanwhile the presidents change in policy precedes several bipartisan bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO SO and NOx Given the presidents new stance however the prospects for these bills gaining much momentum may diminish In summary President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to shortterm resolutions to the nations energy crisis over longterm environmental concerns Given the fact that coal presently generates more than half of the nations energy needs the fossil fueldespite its deba ted environmental impactsis a critical component of the US energy supply Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the countrys power supply it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy reliance on coal to continue at least for the near term While some will continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise s and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists an argument can be made that the nations supply problems have worsened since last fall when the president was campaigning After examining the mix of current factors including consistently high naturalgas prices demand that remains on the rise and a continued reliance on coal which remains comparatively

Pacific Gas Electric Co NYSE PCG the utility unit of PGOCorp on Friday filed for reorganization under Chapter Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco The company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Gov Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Pacific Gas Electric Co reportedly has more than billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases Neither PGOCorp nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing Analysis Despite the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing has been in the making for several months and that its financial insolvency appeared inevitable the actual filing for Chapter protection on Friday caught many by surprise including Californias top officials Ironically the utilitys million customers may end up being the least impacted by the bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co will remain in the business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court However there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of Californias largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and across the country the full impact of which is not presently known There naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major news so I wont waste time regurgitating information that is being widely disseminated Rather I will focus on what I believe to be some of the key elements of this story The bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to PGOthat the state of California would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a price that PGObelieves the assets to be worth In addition a new rate increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of Pacific Gas Electric Cos existing debts The night before the bankruptcy filing Gov Davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated that the rate increases would be contingent on PGOselling the transmission assets to the state In other words if PGOagreed to the states price for the transmission assets a portion of the rate increase would be used to alleviate the utilitys subsequent debts The inside word is that Pacific Gas Electric Co was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to disagreements with Gov Davis regarding the price of the transmission assets which could be anywhere from billion to billion Officially Pacific Gas Electric Co said that its negotiations with the state were going nowhere The CPUC had previously approved rate increases of up to percent for the customers of SCE and Pacific Gas Electric Co but clearly stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing debt In his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy Gov Davis reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for nonresidential customers that would average about percent Davis had fiercely resisted any form of a rate increase to accommodate Pacific Gas Electric Cos debt The official PGOresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to pay off existing debts of the utility operation PGOCorp and other nonutility subsidiaries are not impacted by the bankruptcy measure at least for now Due to a shrewd financial restructuring that was approved by FERC a few months ago see Issue Alert for more information highprofit subsidiaries such as National Energy Group and PGOGas Transmission Northwest Corp were placed into a specialpurpose bankruptcy remote entity known as GTN Holdings LLC Consequently these nonregulated subsidiaries along with the parent corporation may not be impacted by the utilitys bankruptcy filing The US federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits were divided among the parent operation and other nonregulated subsidiaries but for the time being only Pacific Gas Electric Co has declared bankruptcy Power suppliers still owed money by PGOcould likely never get paid Much of Pacific Gas Electric Cos billion debt is owed to power suppliers that sold power to the utility over the last year or so With the onset of lengthy legal proceedings it becomes more unlikely that these power suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon Consequently power suppliers owed more than million by Pacific Gas Electric Co also saw their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement According to a report in Reuters Duke Energy NYSE DUK was down or percent at Dynegy Corp NYSE DYN was off or percent at Williams Companies NYSE WMB was or percent lower at and Reliant Energy NYSE REI lost or percent to In addition there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company even if the state of California remains involved as the buying intermediary For its part PGOCorp Chairman Bob Glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to eventually pay all our debt in full but he did not report a specific figure In addition to the power suppliers banks that have provided loans to Pacific Gas Electric Co such as Bank of America Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase could all be impacted by the bankruptcy Pacific Gas Electric Cos preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as Bank of New York to which it owes more than billion Although some payments may be made after years of litigation such lenders and bondholders may be forced to write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to Pacific Gas Electric Co as losses The blame game is in full force Davis and state regulators have repeatedly blamed outofstate generators for price gouging and federal regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices Also Gov Davis has issued harsh words against PGE Over the weekend Davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate PGOfor awarding an estimated million in bonuses and raises to about midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of the utilitys bankruptcy filing Management at PGOis just focused upon padding their own pockets not in discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California Davis reportedly said Earlier Davis had previously issued a statement saying PGOmanagement is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed In addition California regulators have criticized FERC for not implementing wholesale price caps in the Western region which they believe would help to stabilize the market in California US Sen Dianne Feinstein said that it is inexcusable that FERC has refused to intervene and provide temporary stability and reliability through the use of wholesale price caps Feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price caps for the entire Western region For its part FERC refused to take responsibility for the California crisis saying instead that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing was the unfortunate result of a massive failure by policymakers at all levels PGOblames decisions made by the CPUC and Gov Davis that it believes undermined its ability to return to financial viability and recover its uncollected costs Specifically PGOblames the California government for not allowing it to recover prior wholesale power costs through recent rate increases which essentially has kept the utility in a debt situation PGOalso believed that the governor was not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of PGEs transmission system to the state Consumer groups continue to lambaste the utility and its parent company which they claim has billion in available capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt Could the bankruptcy filing of SCE be far behind The secondlargest utility in California continues to maintain that it intends to avoid bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a comprehensive solution to our current crisis However because the two utilities have been so closely linked through the states energy crisis PGEs decision to declare bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that SCE will eventually follow suit In fact Moodys Investors Service is reporting that Pacific Gas and Electric Cos bankruptcy increases the possibility of an SCE bankruptcy filing Further Moodys is reporting that numerous creditor groups particularly the small generators have become impatient with the time that it has taken to advance settlement discussions with the state of California thereby increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors On April the day of Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing shares of SCE tumbled or nearly percent to finish trading at Surprisingly SCE shares jumped about by midmorning on April to trade at about The reason for the increase is not fully known although SCE continues to remain involved in negotiations with Gov Davis regarding its own outstanding debt This is just the start of a long drawn out legal process The electric utilities that previously declared bankruptcy including El Paso Electric Public Service Company of New Hampshire and El Paso Electric all found themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years Thus although we may not know the ultimate outcome for Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings we do know that the company will be essentially consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial records for the foreseeable future Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco has been assigned the PGOcase Montali will have the ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how PGOreorganizes or arranges to repay its debt Several positive elements of the process that might work to PGEs advantage is that the utility will now be held accountable to only one individual Judge Montali Pacific Gas Electric Co will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and federal lines Second by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are completed market dynamics hopefully will have improved and Californias supply problem should be resolved Consequently Pacific Gas Electric Co could eventually rise again like the phoenix out of its ashes and emerge as a much stronger company than it is today An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

April SCE Agrees to Sell Transmission Assets to California by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis At a joint press conference with Governor Gray Davis Edison International Chairman President and CEO John Bryson announced agreement on a plan to restore Southern California Edison SCE to financial health The negotiat ed resolution with the Governor is far preferable for our company our employe es and for our customers than is going into bankruptcy Bryson said The key part of the agreement is that the state will receive a primary utility asse t SCEs mile transmission system SCE employees will operate and maintain the system through a contractual arrangement with the state Analysis Only days after Pacific Gas Electric Co its California utilit y counterpart declared bankruptcy SCE announced what is being billed as a pact with the State of California that should keep it out of bankruptcy court From all appearances this seems to be a strong deal for SCE as it not only keeps the utility financially solvent but also removes it from a line of business that remains rather uncertain and financially unrewarding First lets establish the key aspects of the agreement Keep in mind that the California Legislature the California Public Utilities Commission CPU C and federal regulators must approve this deal Edison International NYSE EIX the parent of SCE has agreed to sell the utilitys transmission asse ts to the State of California for billion The confirmed price tag that the state is paying for SCEs lines seems like a generous offer because it is about times the systems current book value of billion the origin al cost less any accumulated depreciation OCLD recorded in SCEs books Since transmission rates are based on an allowed rate of return on OCLD it is uncertain that SCEs current transmission rates will provide sufficient revenues for the state to cover its purchase cost The sale includes only SCEs transmission assets It appears that SCE will remain in the distribution business and continue delivering power to customers and running generation Both the state and SCE have agreed to commit to no less than billion of capital investment in utility infrastructure over the next five years which presumably includes upgrades to the transmission system and new generation capacity It is not entirely clear at this time how the billion in capital investment will be shared between the State of California and SCE Edison officials also have agreed to sell costbased not marketbased electricity to the state from power generated at SCE plants Edison Mission Energy the unregulated subsidiary of Edison International is also obligat ed to sell output from its Sunrise power plant exclusively to California under costbased pricing Although SCE divested much of its power assets under agreements with the CPUC it still shares ownership of the San Onofre Nucle ar Plant Units and with San Diego Gas Electric SDGE and shares in the Palo Verde Mohave and Four Corners generating stations SCE also owns hydroelectric facilities and the Pebbly Beach generating facility The Sunrise Mission power project is a gasfired power plant that is currently under construction Reportedly the Sunrise plant is expected to provide about MW of electricity during peak periods of demand this summer According to the Memorandum of Understanding between SCE and the California Department of Water Resources SCEs generation assetsincluding all en ergy capacity ancillary services and any combination thereofwill be commit ted to costbased ratemaking for SCEs bundled service customers In addition SCE is prohibited from selling any of these generation assets until Dec Also included within the agreement is SCEs commitment to dismiss all pendi ng lawsuits against the CPUC related to market prices in California Edison International also has agreed to refund million to the utility unit th at reportedly had been paid in dividends to the parent company The billion that the state is paying SCE for its transmission assets can be used to pay preexisting debt to creditors including power generato rs that have previously sold power to SCE This is the essential benefit that the utility receives in the deal and it is a considerable achievement given that the liquid capital theoretically should stave off bankruptcy proceedings It is also important to note that this is the first revenue stream that has been specifically earmarked for SCEs preexisting debts Recent rate increases that have been approved by the CPUC can only be appli ed to subsequent debts incurred by the utility In addition SCE will be allow ed to issue bonds to recover a substantial portion of the approximate billion in debt that the utility has accrued due to uncollected purchases o f wholesale power The agreement should return SCEs debt to investment grade making it easier for the company to raise money to fund future operations By reducing its debt load Edison CEO John Bryson remains confident that SCE can borrow to pay out remaining debts SCE Chairman and CEO Stephen Frank expressed confidence that a final agreement could be reached before the end of the year although the California Legislature reportedly has agreed to expedite its own review of the agreement and provide approval before summer temperatures begin to wrea k havoc on the California market If for any reason the sale of the transmission assets has not been completed within two years SCE is obligat ed to sell to the state its hydroelectric generation facilities instead at a tobedetermined price Although the deal is expected to proceed some concerns have been raised about federal issues related to interstate commerce In addition the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cowith whi ch SCE has often been intertwinedremains in bankruptcy court could also complicate the agreement between SCE and the state News of the agreement immediately caused Edison shares to increase by about or percent to on April As of the close of trading on April Edison shares were priced at about For its part SCE said that it was racing toward an agreement with the governor to avoid being forced into an involuntary bankruptcy Yet for som e time SCE has been more willing to sell its transmission assets than PGOeve r appeared to be In fact I wrote in the IssueAlert that Gov Davis had reached an agreement in principle with SCE regarding the sale of the transmission lines Most of the key elements of the agreement that has been agreed to by both parties have been in the works for over two months PGOCorp issued a statement that it was pleased that SCE had been able to reach an agreement with Gov Davis but said that the agreement did not change its own direction toward bankruptcy court According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom Fitch analysts have suggested that the sale of SCEs transmission assets to the state of California could in fact lend a framework that might be used in Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings What this might mean is that Federal Judge Dennis Montali the official overseeing Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy might rely upo n the agreement between SCE and the State of California to mandate a similar deal for PGE Gov Davis commented that the SCE deal could serve as a bas is for separate agreements with SDGE and eventually PGE if they choose to come back to the negotiating table In fact the state could submit a plan to Judge Montali outlining a purchase of PGEs transmission assets which the judge could ultimately enforce An argument could be made that the agreement SCE has reached with the State of the California provides benefits to the utility that go beyond protectin g it from bankruptcy One could argue that SCE benefits by being able to exit the transmission business altogether which in many ways can cause tremendo us problems for the companies that choose to remain in this business Transmission operations also typically offer a low rate of return in SCEs case according to its most recent K filing its transmission business resulted in a return on equity of percent SCE had proposed that the return on equity for its transmission assets be set at percent which FERC rejected FERC has ultimate authority over transmission service pricing Thus the question could be raised of why SCE would even want to remain in the transmission business given this low return on equity Behin d the scenes SCE could very well have previously made the determination that its transmission business was not a valuable part of its overall operation This could be representative of an international trend as regulatory agencies in Australia and Great Britain have also set lower limits on the average transmission network charges that utilities can implement Moreover the State of California does not bring extensive operational expertise to its new role as a transmission owner Thus the state is wise to keep SCE employees in charge of the operation and maintenance of the transmission system This substantially reduces the risk for the state whi ch is a prudent move From the states perspective it gets an asset in exchan ge for a bailout which makes its investment in SCE beneficial However the transmission business will present unique challenges for the state such as raising capital for transmission improvements and siting procedures The state may quickly learn why the transmission business is perceived as being so challenging and why it is difficult to entice companies to build new transmission lines especially considering the low rate of return that the transmission business offers On the other hand by assuming the role of a transmission system owner the State of California will be in a position to obtain competitive information about the activities of power generators in the state This could result in a significant advantage for the State of California if it remains in its current powerbuying role An archive list of previous

Source According to a new report from Energy Info Source the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has begun to articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs With several approvals a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO application FERC is shaping RTO participation among investorowned utilities Analysis The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO applications based on decisions that the commission has made up to this point According to Energy Info Source FERC has concentrated its efforts on the Southeast and Western regions Within the Southeast FERC has essentially rejected Southern Companys SeTrans Gridco while conditionally approving GridSouth and Grid Florida In the West the RTO West applicationwhich represents an alliance among nine utilitiesappears to have received FERCs favor and is the preeminent leader among nonISO RTO participation efforts However despite these established trends FERC still remains at odds with many of the leading transmission owners in the nation which foresee a potential conflict between the commissions rulemaking on transmission rates and its potential impact on retail rates which are regulated by individual states For background an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission systems within a particular region The origins of FERCs RTO policy dates back to its December Order in which it strongly encouraged all transmissionowning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO by Oct with actual membership established by December of this year FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received and its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members of the commission hold Over the last year or two FERC has engaged in an ongoing debate between its preference for transco forprofit models for RTOs as opposed to independent system operators nonprofit Chairman Curt Heacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model while other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs However moving forward it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate including the limit of one entity per region As noted FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the Southeast and Western regions In addition to the obvious need to establish stability in the West another explanation for the commissions dual focus is that other regions in the United States namely the Midwest and the Northeast already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO FERC may be focusing on the West and Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established an acceptable level of market independence The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending before FERC The RTO West which FERC has referred to as the anchor of the region has been generally accepted as a broad concept RTO West includes nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest Avista Bonneville Power Administration BPA Idaho Power Montana Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power BPA is by far the largest of the RTO West members controlling about percent of the transmission system in the region For the most part RTO West is an ISO although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella The second western RTO is Desert Star which includes utilities that are located in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas The third proposed RTO for the Western region is the California ISO which has been operational since April and wishes to remain a standalone entity FERCs main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its desire for one RTO in the area instead of three The primary rationale for this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be more easily managed than multiple entities In addition gaming by power generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs which would require additional market rules to control the gaming FERCs general approach has been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed The California ISO has tweaked the commissions patience in particular as this solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join other entities The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps in California whenever reserves fall below percent This has been something that the state has long requested but the price caps come with the condition that California must file an application by June to enter into an RTO with other Western states Otherwise the price caps will be lifted California is currently contesting this condition Under the leadership of Chairman Heacutebert it is clearly FERCs goal to establish only one RTO for the entire Western region which puts the federal agency at odds with the California government once again The Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares Heacuteberts belief that one regional RTO is the best strategy for the West but also has said that proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the new organization up and running Other western governors have stood in unity that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being Across the country there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the Southeast For instance Chairman Heacuteberts preference for minimal RTOs within one region appears to be a national viewpoint Yet there are unique questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in the West The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida RTOwhich includes Florida Power Light Florida Power Corp and Tampa Electricand GridSouth RTO which includes Progress Energy Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas However FERC rejected Southern Companys SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies other than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy The commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo but told Southern Company not to reapply and to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO In addition FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over control of their generation assets The rejection and conditional approval from FERC which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth have been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in the region should join the alreadyapproved entities In fact FERC reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority Santee Cooper and SeTrans GridCo so that they might also join Some reports indicate that because the Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model such as the one in California FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with its own longterm goals which include a single RTO for the area Nevertheless despite receiving approval from FERC GridSouth is taking issue with two aspects of the commissions approval First GridSouth questions FERCs jurisdiction over bundled retail service and specifically wants the commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled transmission rates GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates including the charge for transmission service under FERC jurisdiction which would allow the commission to change the rates in the future FERCs Order which essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States clearly states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would agree to GridSouths interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled transmission rates Despite these isolated disputes the formation of RTOs across the United States appears to be coming together While the industry awaits for further FERC action on pending RTO applications it is clear that certain trends are emerging FERCs longstanding preference for the transco model over the ISO model appears to be diminishing as evidenced by the commissions approval of RTO West and apparent support of nonprofit operations such as the New York ISO and the Midwest ISO Rather FERC has demonstrated a more primary preference for solitary RTO entities within a region regardless of whether the entity operates as a transco or an ISO From a philosophical perspective establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple entities Further a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain intertie problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region However it will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in independent RTOs such as California to relinquish their autonomy and join forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding the operation of a transmission system An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

approached Calif Gov Gray Davis with a secret deal now made public that offered monetary concessions if the state drops lawsuits and investigations into the companys alleged price gouging Duke made the offer in a secret page letter sent in April to Gov Davis office which the governor confirmed on May Davis spokesman called the letter Dukes wish list which included having the state call off investigations of the North Carolinabased generator Although Gov Davis has acknowledged receipt of the proposal he has not officially accepted or rejected the offer Analysis Dukes desire to make a settlement with the state of California stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March At that time FERC put California power sellers including Duke on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification for their prices Duke is considered to be one of four companies along with Dynegy Reliant and Williams that faces the biggest potential refunds to the state of California In fact Duke reportedly faces potential refunds of up to million for the power that it has sold to California since the start of this year We can fast forward from FERCs investigation to Dukes good faith settlement offer that now sits before Gov Gray Davis The plan sets out specific action steps for new generation conservation programs electric and gas infrastructure improvements regional transmission frameworks and environmental goals In addition Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement agreement for which the California government would agree to cease all ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company Dukes appropriate payment is based on fair estimate of the companys alleged overcharges for power that it sold to the state Yet beyond the spin control surrounding this offer Dukes proposal amounts to a mutual backscratching agreement with Duke clearly obtaining the largest benefit Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke made by the governor and others In return Duke will refund to the state some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping the state with its power supply needs However under the offer Duke will admit no wrongdoing Rather the companys proposal is being presented as an altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of Californias flawed market Neither Duke nor Gov Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Dukes settlement offer but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction of the million that the state wants Other specifics within Dukes proposal that are important to note include the companys commitment to work with the state to get MW of additional peaking capacity ready for summer In addition Duke has offered to enter into longterm contracts with the state on reasonable terms and also attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Dukes pledge to share the financial pain of Californias troubled market with other market participants Presently Duke supplies about percent of Californias power needs the majority of which is based on longterm contracts This is a significant point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market in contrast to many of the other power suppliers under FERCs investigation The company also owns the Moss Landing plant located south of San Jose Calif which it is upgrading with a million investment Duke has established that the plant should be able to provide approximately percent of Californias new generation in While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits the companys total wholesale profits soared percent to million for yearend For the year Dukes California power plants generated percent more electricity than they did in In addition in the plants provided million megawatt hours of electricity to the states power grid versus million the previous year Further in January and February Duke charged more for power through credit premiums which were levied because of the risk of nonpayment associated with Californias financially struggling utilities Duke claims that it is still owed about million by the Department of Water Resources Californias power purchaser Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California On May Tulsabased Williams Co also one of the top four companies reportedly owing the most to California announced that it has agreed to pay million to the California ISO to end FERCs investigation into whether the companys plants were kept offline to drive up prices For several months FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the companys alleged shutdown of two power generation units owned by AES which reportedly allowed Williams to sell power from other units at higher prices The stipulation and consent agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties In other words Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing or price manipulation A Williams spokesperson has said that the million will be deducted from the million that Williams is still owed for power sales to the California ISO and the California PX Much like Duke Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year For yearend the company reported unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for In addition the company reported Q unaudited results that were more than double that of Q million or cents per share compared with a restated million or cents per share Moreover the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made from power sales to the state However one benefit of the deals is that they would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation Yet at least as of this writing Gov Davis remains less than enthused about Dukes offer and has not eased off from his accusation that Duke along with the other power generators has bilked millions of dollars from California consumers In fact although the governor has said that he is willing to continue negotiations with the various power generators he has also vowed not to call off the dogs in the state and federal investigation of any price gouging Toward that end the states lieutenant governor has initiated a classaction suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other power generators accused of price fixing This legal claim follows similar suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego All of the suits basically claim the same thing that Duke and four other power generators engaged in unlawful trading practicessuch as shutting down plantsto drive up market prices in California Duke of course maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied Nevertheless Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the companys part could eventually be determined The stakes have also been raised with some California attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price gouging should face civil and criminal penalties which could include incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the price manipulation to take place Consequently despite Dukes offer and any other proposals that subsequently come from power generators it appears that litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIntroduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corps CEO Chris Hamilos President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this morning at the th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque NM The st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career and reiterated his strong support for his son President George W Bush whom he affectionately refers to as as in rd president The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy However the former president did field questions from the audience regarding a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he faced in his administration and those that are presently challenging his son Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current presidents justreleased energy task plan a page report that outlines approximately steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia The former president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against Saddam Hussein who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world Further President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his presidency during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress that saw the big picture issues in a different light often made it difficult to find common ground The former president made only brief but rather significant references to his sons new energy policy Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney last evening former President Bush said he was aware that the new broadbased plan focused heavily on new supply along with secondary measures for conservation efforts This is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that if you want to lower energy prices you need to establish more supply In addition the former president offered that additional drilling efforts an element of the plan that has sparked a great deal of controversy has to happen if the nation is truly committed to increasing supply However former President Bush did suggest that the nation must be patient as it will take several years to see any significant decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new development efforts Meanwhile the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate As expected the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge easing of cleanair rules that should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit process for oil refinery expansion and construction These platforms have been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan However new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few days are raising the most eyebrows For instance the extent to which nuclear power factors into the administrations energy plan is perhaps greater than was previously anticipated Specifically the Bush plan proposes the extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of socalled breeder reactors which use spent nuclear fuel Breeder reactors although rather common in Europe and Japan have not been used in the United States since the s when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce nuclear weapongrade plutonium as a byproduct Other key elements of the plan include Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government which would supersede states rights to approve new transmission line capacity Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting and speeding up the relicensing requirements for nuclear plants Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury which are common byproducts of coalfired production In turn the Bush administration supports exploring new cleancoal technologies which should increase production by coalfired generating plants A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air Act which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power plants The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued As has been the case since the start of the new administration the continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts However the specific conservation proposals in the energy plan include providing consumers billion in tax credits through to encourage the purchase of highmileage gaselectric hybrid vehicles In addition President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to cogeneration plants which produce both heat and electricity Others including the current presidents father might argue that conservation efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as market forces high prices already are driving renewed conservation across the country Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that often thwarted his policy measures the current President Bush continues to buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy plan In fact just two days ago a group of House Democrats led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMiss outlined a plan that calls for increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan However Democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles Consequently the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and Democrats to support cooperation in Congress That cooperation may be necessary as Congress must approve President Bushs energy plan in order for it to take effect TOMORROW Summary of CIS Conference and analysis of key IT issues facing the energy

and Republicans since the November elections not for seven years as was incorrectly stated in the column We apologize for any misunderstanding that this error might have caused IMAGE IMAGE May EDF Pursues Italys Montedison Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEPower giant Electricitde France EDF has sent shock waves through Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise its stake in electric firm Montedison to percent from about percent However Romano Prodi the European Union commissioner for competition is considering an intervention in the battle between EDF the French electricity monopoly and the Italian government The latter has passed an ad hoc law restricting EDF to percent of the voting rights for Montedison the Italian electricity supplier spun off by Enel Analysis Once again the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the European power market with EDF playing the staring role For the last year or so as the European Union EU has enacted electric competition across the Continent Frances EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by foreign suppliers Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through its ownership of London Electricity the French power firm has wanted for some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy However the neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market As I have mentioned before in this column France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country As a result EDF which controls approximately percent of the French electric industry may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad until it further opens its own market to competition To date France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the EU and EDF has played a large role in this resistance While other European countries such as Germany have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although other companies such as Spains Endesa have attempted to push through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country Nevertheless EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its holdings in Montedison one of Italys main electricity companies Reports are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison EDF recently said that its stake increased from percent to percent However other reports have indicated that EDF already controls about percent of the capital assets of Montedison Both increases in Montedison were made recently which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market regulatory Consob EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the companys financial assets across Europe However at the same time EDF has also indicated that any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading purposes In other words EDF wants to control the generating assets of Montedison for resale across Europes wholesale market Further with a percent stake EDF would become Montedisons largest shareholder and a major presence in Italys power market even as France remains mostly closed EDFs argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian government The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators In fact EDF has admitted that its strategy is to make percent of its turnover from activities abroad by the end of compared with percent currently Consequently it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its home country for expansion opportunities and these opportunities typically have been in distribution and generation assets Moving forward the company has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation For instance last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for the regional UK electricity company Seeboard which is owned by American Electric Power NYSE AEP Serving about two million connected customers in England Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables An acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDFs overall expansion efforts in Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales which EDF bought from Entergy in In addition EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden Graninge and Germany EnBW and reportedly is Polands largest electricity distributor These acquisitions were made by EDF International which is wholly owned by the French government and thus subject to EU oversight Perhaps due to EDFs size and presence in Europe these previous acquisitions were allowed without a great deal of EU intervention However now that other countries have voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede it is unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny As noted trading appears to be the next wave of EDFs expansion efforts Toward this end EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in to create an energy trading company called EDF Trading The various companies that EDF has invested in across Europe support the companys efforts to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across the Continent For its part the Italian government has responded that it will block any increase of EDFs ownership of Montedison based primarily on the argument that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France Specifically Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison Further outlining its position the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be sold by Enel one of the countrys main power firms As Montedison will be one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel the Italian government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and thus having access to additional power assets in Italy For instance Enel is planning to sell Elettrogen a generation company that produces about percent of the production capacity in Italy If EDF were to increase its stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen then EDF as a foreign entity would gain a lock over the Italian power supply market Italys antiEDF law is an interesting development but it does not mark the first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent Spain also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with regard to the French companys pursuit of Hidrocantabrico Spains fourth largest supplier However despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict any expansion of EDF the laws although they are already in place may ultimately be deemed anticompetitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates antitrust allegations in the United States any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles EDF also remains interested in the Spanishs largest power utility Endesa which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the French electricity market through a percent acquisition of French electricity generator SocieacutetNationale dElectricitet de Thermique Endesa which recently terminated an attempted merger with Iberdrola Spains second largest power firm has been viewed as a takeover target for larger companies such as EDF At last report the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on how far control was being exercised In other words EU intervention will be based on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an increased stake in Montedison The fact that France remains resistant to electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the governments of Italy and Spain An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North

Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEThe City of Dallas has become another of Texas major customers to take advantage of the savings available in the states emerging competitive electric market The city has signed an electricity contract with AES NewEnergy Under the terms of the contract AES NewEnergy will provide electricity to approximately service accounts located at municipal sites throughout the city that are currently served by TXU Electric The city of Dallas one of the nations largest cities has a population of more than million people Analysis The date at which Texas customers will begin to receive power from new suppliers under the states electric pilot program has been pushed back to midJuly but today marks the start of when new suppliers begin turning in their bid forecasts to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT Full electric competition begins in Texas on Jan Thus its a good time to do an assessment of the many interesting dynamics that have emerged in the Lone Star State some of which might pose unique challenges to the states electric market As Texas continues to prepare for full competition its electric pilot program is getting off to a rather slow start at least on the residential side an ongoing debate about incorporating Texas into the national transmission grid continues and ERCOT defends itself against claims that the state should be closely watched this summer At the same time Pat Wood the states highestranking utility regulator marks his departure from Texas to assume a position with FERC In previous columns Ive established the main points of Texas restructuring plan see IssueAlert at wwwscientechcomrcifor a review As incumbent utilities in Texas are allowed to create unregulated energy providers that can compete outside their traditional service territory an interesting game of musical chairs is taking place among the various incumbent competitors For instance Dallasbased TXU is positioning itself to hold on to its North Texas customers while expanding into Houston while Houstonbased Reliant attempts to retain its base in Houston while moving into Dallas At the same time new competitors AES NewEnergy among them have moved into the state attempting to get a jumpstart on securing customers during this pilot phase At last count regional electric providers have registered with the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to provide power to Texas customers Also worth noting is the fact that after much speculation I recently confirmed that AEP has indeed registered as a retail electric provider REP in Texas under the name Mutual Energy representing approximately one million customers First lets look at the electric pilot program After issuing a recent delay in the start date for the pilot originally slated for June to ensure that computer systems were running effectively those Texas customers participating in the pilot should start receiving power from new providers in midJuly State officials had high hopes that most of the percent of the states electric customers eligible to participate in the pilot would select a new electric provider However at last count fewer than percent of the residential customers that are eligible have signed up since enrollment in the pilot began Feb this represents about percent of TXUs residential customers and percent of those currently served by Reliant The pilot officially ends when full competition begins Fears arising from the national coverage of the California situation appear to be dissuading Texas residential customers from participating along with general apathy about electric service Also at play is a percent discount that residential and small business customers receive from their incumbent utilities which may lower the incentive for these customers to seek out a new provider While Texas residential customers appear hesitant or apathetic about electric competition the states large industrial and commercial customers are eagerly embracing the opportunity to sign on with a new electric provider There are about large electric users in the state defined as those businesses that consume more than MW of power at peak usage Ccustomers have filled up many of the slots available in the pilot program for their customer classes and naturally appear to be generating the most competition in the state Within this space AES NewEnergy is gaining momentum In addition to its contract with the city of Dallas NewEnergy also secured a deal with HEB one of Texas leading retail companies with stores in the state AES NewEnergy is a subsidiary of AES Corp NYSE AES which controls more than MW in countries Formed in AES NewEnergy claims to be present in very state where a competitive energy market is emerging I spoke with representatives from the city of Dallas regarding their selection of AES NewEnergy among other providers including those based in Texas Interestingly NewEnergy was the only REP that responded to the citys bid Another large deal was recently announced between Cinemark USA which operates movie theaters around the state and TXU Under the contract TXU will provide energy services to Cinemark theaters outside of its traditional North Texas service territory Unlike the city of Dallas which only received a bid from one REP comparative price was a factor in Cinemarks selection of TXU Whether or not Texas should be forced to join the nations transmission grid is a debate that has been heating up over the last few weeks Ironically although President Bush usually supports free market forces he reportedly is considering a mandate that would force ERCOT into becoming interconnected with the nations two other transmission grids the Western Interconnection and the Eastern Interconnection Presently ERCOT stands independent from the other two grids and wants to keep it that way However because Texas is generally thought to have excess power it is now being considered that the Lone Star State should be made to export some of that supply to powerstarved California Presently this is not possible due to the fact that ERCOT has limited interconnections to surrounding power pools This is not the first time that this issue has been tossed around While President Bush was still governor of the state the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT studied the option of linking Texas to the other grids and found that it would be cheaper for the state to remain disconnected However as the issue of FERCs oversight over regional transmission organizations gains momentum the Bush administration may overrule Texas current sovereignty over its transmission system Further the debate on this issue is related to the policy of eminent domain in the Bush administrations energy plan which would give FERC the power to buy state property for the construction of interstate transmission lines However the question of just how much excess generation Texas might have to give to California has come into question over the last several weeks The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC sparked the controversy recently when it issued a report identifying a number of areas in the United States that should be watched closely this summer due to supply concerns In the same report NERC also mentioned that Texas should be watched closely but out of concern about the states pilot program rather than supply deficiencies ERCOT immediately disputed NERCs claim reiterating the states oftrepeated contention that it is more than prepared for competition and in fact has a percent reserve power margin In addition Texas officials point to the fact that since new plants have started operations in the state generating MW By the time competition begins fully in January more plants and MW are scheduled to come online Nevertheless in response NERC stood behind its assessment which it based on two possible ramifications of the summers pilot NERC is concerned that as Texas consolidates control areas into one and percent of the states utility customers switch to new providers as is hoped by the state this could take a toll on transmission capability Another challenge facing Texas is the shrinkage of its regulatory commission As noted Pat Wood has now officially left his post as chairman of the PUCT to become a FERC commissioner Woods departure leaves only Brett Perlman as the sole PUCT commissioner something that concerns many stakeholders as a number of final decisions on rules that will govern Texas electric market are still pending Texas Gov Rick Perry has made no announcement as to when Wood might be replaced on the PUCT along with Judy Walsh who left the commission last January Moreover the fact that the states pilot program has not attracted a large number of residential customers is not surprising Texas may not have a strong competitive residential market for some time considering the percent discount for residential and small business customers that was included in the states restructuring plan Rather the competitive Cmarket which is where the largest savings can be obtained anyway may be the true test of the success of Texas competitive market This determining factor along with the states ability to retain a strong power supply ultimately will decide the fate of Texas electric industry Because the vast majority of the new generation in Texas is fueled by natural gas there are also some related concerns about competitors being able to beat the fixed rates of utility REPs if naturalgas prices remain high However despite these factors Texas is clearly gearing up for competition and pursuing deregulation in its own independent fashion The eyes of the energy industry remain fixed on Texas as the statewhich by the way will reportedly soon become the largest state in terms of megawatts generatedcontinues its attempts to distance itself from the national debate that has somewhat tainted electric deregulation

North American Power System b y RDIFT Energy is now available from SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March President Bush Reverses Position on CO Emissions by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News Item from The Washington Post March President Bush has decided n ot to seek reductions in the carbon dioxide CO emissions of the nations power plants reversing himself on a campaign pledge after encountering strong resistance from the coal and oil industries and from Republican alli es on Capitol Hill In a letter to four Republican senators Bush cited a rece nt Energy Department study showing that restrictions on CO emissions would result in a shift from coal to natural gas and lead to higher energy costs I do not believethat the government should impose on power plants mand atory emissions for carbon dioxide Bush said Analysis The sudden change in President Bushs position on CO emissions naturally has elicited strong reactions from both sides of the debate The extent to which CO contributes to the nations pollution and whether or n ot the government should take an active role in restricting CO emissions has become an intensely politicized issue Democrats and environmental groups responded with outrage to what they perceive as a betrayal by the president while coal and oil industry officials believe that Bushs decision will ensure a more balanced energy and environmental policy I wont attempt to debate the political aspects of the presidents decision Rather I will analyze Bushs current position impacts the energy industry and whether or not the lifting of COrestrictions does indeed contribute to a sound energy policy It is true that during his campaign the president made promises to limit C O emissions In a speech in late September Bush said With the help of Congress environmental groups and industry we will require all power plan ts to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide mercury and carbon dioxide within a reasonable period of time Yet while many critics have claimed that Bushs refusal to place limits on CO is a philosophical turnabout White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that carbon dioxide should not have been included as a pollutant in Bushs campaign position because it is not classified as one in the Clean Air Act Further the White House has said that Bushs original promise was a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production In fact although many scientists believe that CO is a key contributor to global warming it has not been proven to have any direct effect on human health Consequently CO has never been classified as a pollutant under th e Clean Air Act because in the eyes of those determining Clean Air classifications it has no detrimental human health or environmental impact except as it applies to concerns about global warming In his decision to abstain from placing any restrictions on CO emissions Bush noted the incomplete state of scientific knowledge of the causes of and solutions to global climate change and the lack of commercially available technologies f or removing and storing carbon dioxide The president maintains that he is committed to an energy policy that would seek to improve air quality emissions of NOx SO and mercury which are already regulated as pollutant s but not CO Bush also said that he would work with Congress to reduce emissions from power plants specifically but that any such strategy would include phasedin reductions and marketbased incentives to help the indust ry meet the targets Moreover the president apparently cannot reconcile any possible restrictio ns on CO emissions with ramifications that the restrictions might have on domestic power supply Clearly any limits on CO emissions would have tremendous impact on coalburning power plants By some estimates coal a relatively cheap and plentiful fuel which accounts for more than percent of the electricity generated in the United States produces about percen t of the nations CO output more than any other fuel Yet industry officials have warned the president that any effort to restrict CO emissio ns would compromise efforts to increase domestic energy production Since Bush took office as president in January it has become increasingly clear that a major component of the presidents imminent energy plan will be efforts to increase domestic power supply through a diverse fuel mix that includes coa l natural gas and nuclear The president has maintained that he sees a supplemental role for renewable energies such as wind and solar However according to reports out earlier this week Bush is proposing to cut the DOEs renewable fuels and energy efficiency budget by to percent In any case establishing this diverse fuel mix will take time and the president realizes that the country faces an immediate energy crisis resulting from a growing supply demand imbalance Aside from power supply concerns the president also acknowledged the curre nt high prices for natural gas and how a reduction in coalfired generation would most likely keep prices at their high levels In fact the president said that conclusions made in a recent DOE report led to his decision to ba ck away from CO restrictions more than any pressure he might have received from oil and coal lobbying groups as has been reported in many recent news articles Bush noted that the DOE study had concluded that regulating CO emissions would have led to significantly higher electricity prices The translation of this is that if restrictions were to be placed on coalburning plants many power suppliers would turn to naturalgas production as an alternative Naturalgas supplies are already compromised in this country due to increasing demand which has driven prices up to unprecedented levels Bushs decision reflects the concern that if power suppliers begin turning from coal to natural gas in larger numbers this wi ll continue to exacerbate the supply shortage and keep prices alarmingly high This is important new information that warrants a reevaluation especiall y at a time of rising energy prices and a serious energy shortage President Bush said The DOE report also indicated that because coalfired power plants are the major power sector emitters of CO compliance with the emission caps would be expected to have a major impact on coal consumption and production both nationally and regionally If COcaps were to be put into place substantia l reductions in coal consumption would result according to the DOE with corresponding drops in the projections for coal production Further becaus e coal has a carbon content more than percent higher per Btu than that of natural gas the DOE report said that the carbon allowance fees related to CO caps would make the continued operation of many existing coal plants uneconomical In addition to the DOE report Bush continues to be counseled by an energy advisory team including Vice President Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham as well as having the ear of other members of the Republican Party Many Republican senators including Jesse Helms North Carolina and Chuck Hagel Nebraska expressed alarm over Bushs campaign promises to reduce CO emissions out of concern that the promises were a step closer to ratifying an international treaty regarding pollution control The Kyoto Protocol negotiated and signed by the Clinton administration but still not ratified would commit industrialized countries to ongoing cuts in CO along with SO and NOx emissions Negotiations over the Protocol broke down last November but are expected to resume this July If ratified the Protocol would limit CO emissions below levels Currently CO emissions in th e United States are about percent over levels Reportedly Sens Helm s and Hagel oppose ratification of the Kyoto Protocol because they believe it could adversely impact the economy and allow American energy policy to be directed by an international treaty It is important to note how the presidents new stand on CO emissions relates to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Just two weeks ago t he US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the power to issue new standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air However the EPA does not currently regulate CO emissions EPA Administrator Christine Whitman in a series of public statements had vehemently defended and supported President Bushs previously espoused commitment to controlling CO emissions Meanwhile the presidents change in policy precedes several bipartisan bills that are expected to be introduced in the House and Senate this week The measures reportedly will provide incentives and set requirements to modernize power plants and reduce emissions of CO SO and NOx Given the presidents new stance however the prospects for these bills gaining much momentum may diminish In summary President Bush apparently felt the need to give priority to shortterm resolutions to the nations energy crisis over longterm environmental concerns Given the fact that coal presently generates more than half of the nations energy needs the fossil fueldespite its deba ted environmental impactsis a critical component of the US energy supply Realizing that growing demand continues to compromise the countrys power supply it appears that Bush made the unpopular decision to allow the heavy reliance on coal to continue at least for the near term While some will continue to say that the president reneged on his original campaign promise s and was unduly influenced by oil and gas lobbyists an argument can be made that the nations supply problems have worsened since last fall when the president was campaigning After examining the mix of current factors including consistently high naturalgas prices demand that remains on the rise and a continued reliance on coal which remains comparatively inexpensiveit is understandable that the president would take this posi tion However the general consensus among scientists is that CO emissions contribute to global warming and that a longterm solution to curb CO emissions must be enacted As President Bush unveils his energy plan over the next few weeks it will be interesting to see how or if he addresses th e issue of CO emissions from a

and European leaders agreed to disagree over a glob al warming treaty as the president sought to reassure allies that sharp polic y differences would not hamper relations between Europe and the United States During several closeddoor sessions Bush and his European counterparts confronted one of their most contentious areas of disagreement the presidents rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming We agreed t o disagree Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters The Europe an Union is sticking to the Kyoto Protocol The United States has chosen anoth er policy Analysis It is rather amazing how prominently energy issues have factored into the first six months of the Bush administration In contrast to the eight years of the Clinton administration when energy policy often took a backseat to other concerns President BushFa result of California blacko uts a national shortage of natural gas skyhigh electricity prices and a controversial energy task planFbeen comparatively consumed by energy iss ues Now in a political legacy from the previous administration President Bush finds himself grappling with another contentious energy problem that has global ramifications Departing from what appears to be an international consensus President Bush has declared the Kyoto Protocol an ineffective treaty and has instead decided to further examine the greenhouse gas proble m which has raised further questions about the presidents commitment to environmental issues First let me provide some background The Kyoto Protocol developed out of meetings held in December in Kyoto Japan during which time the Unite d Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in principle to a series of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions About governments of various countries including the United States participated in the Protocol and agreed to reduce their aggregate carbon dioxide CO equivalent emissions by at least percent below levels by Noticeably exempt from the Protocol were developing countries such as China and IndiaFof the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the worldwhich resisted taking on any sort of formal reduction plan until industrialized countries proceeded with their own This marked the central flaw in the Protocol in that participants such as Europe Japan and the United States argued that it would be impossible to reach the Protocols goals without th e active and controlled participation of developing countries Consequently the United States could not garner twothirds support from the Senate whic h would be required to ratify the Protocol despite endorsement from the Clinton administration The United States is the largest emitter of CO accounting for onequarter of the world total per year and thus its participation in the Protocol has been considered essential The Protocols emissions targets include all major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide NOx and greenhouse gases created by industrial processes which are artificial chemicals called halocarbons CFCs HFCs and PFCs and longlived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride SF The Protocol requires the main developed countries to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gases by varying amounts percent for Europea n Union countries percent for the United States and percent for Japan With the onset of his new administration President Bush announced last Mar ch that the United States would not support the Kyoto Protocol again arguing that developing nations were not included and the goals were not realistic Further Bush has voiced the concern that ratifying the Protocol would severely damage the US economy as it would restrict industrial production The president has also pointed out that although European nations espouse support for the Protocol none of the EU members has yet to ratify the treaty Instead President Bush has adopted a goslow approach toward global warming and has vowed to spend more money to investigate the problem and work with other nations to produce a better plan A new report from the National Academy of Sciences requested by the Bush administration found that global warming is indeed occurring as the result of human activity Specifically the report found that the Earths temperatures could rise between and degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century On the other hand the report could not reliably establish ho w much of the warming trends result from natural variations how fast future warming will occur or how corrective actions might correct it Thus the president asserted that these unanswered questions warranted further investigation into the greenhouse gas problem The president has come under fire both domestically and abroad for what is perceived as a policy that gives preference to business over the environmen t In addition to his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol President Bush also announced in March that he opposes any domestic restrictions in CO emissio ns from the nations power plants retracting on a pledge that he had made during his campaign Carbon dioxide is not classified as a pollutant by the Clean Air Act and thus the White House said that Bushs original promise w as a mistake inconsistent with the presidents broader goal of increasing domestic energy production Toward that end the Bush administration has focused on the construction of some new power plants across the count ry to resolve a growing supply demand imbalance On the other hand business groups have applauded the presidents approach echoing his belief that the Protocol would harm the nations economy and that domestic technologybase d solutions represent a better solution This is obviously a political story packed with passion on both sides of th e debate I wont use this space to criticize or defend President Bushs environmental stand Instead I think it will be useful to clearly identify the two polarized approaches that world leaders are taking toward the Kyoto Protocol European leaders have vowed to enact the Protocol without the United States which may not be possible The Protocol can only be enacted if nations that produced percent of the industrialized worlds carbon dioxi de in decide to ratify it Japan could be the wild card in the debate as it is leaning toward the Protocol but has not yet officially ratified it I f Japan does participate proponents of the Protocol would have percent of emissions enough for ratification Nevertheless here is how the two approaches shake out The Bush Approach We were given the best indication of the approach Preside nt Bush plans to take in his own environmental proposal expected some time th is summer in a recent radio address With new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment the president said The Bush administrations previously released energy plan is primarily focused on building the nations energy supply through the expedited construction of new generation including nuclear power plants Further the president has said that energy production and environmental protection are not competing priorities and c an both be achieved with new technology While the president has not made any specific references to new provisions for limiting CO emissions from existing or new plants the new technology to which he has referred most likely includes cleancoal technologies that can be implemented to reduce emissions from coalfired plants As noted in the IssueAlert new cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed by various companies throughout the United States One example is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More tha n percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada As coal remains the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves muc h of the nations plan for reducing emissions will focus on coalfired generation It is important to note however that most of the cleancoal technologies currently being developed eliminate SO pollutants and NOx bu t may do little to address CO emissions which is the primary focus of the Kyoto Protocol President Bush has also stated that his administration will fully fund high priority areas for scientific research into climate change over the next fi ve years and help developing nations such as China and India to match the US commitment The Kyoto Protocol Approach European Commission President Romano Prodi has said that the European Union countries will proceed with ratifying the Kyoto Protocol As noted the participation of another large industrialized country such as Japan is needed to officially enact the Protocol If the Protocol is enacted an international conference will be held in Bonn Germany this July to spell out how the specific goals of the treaty will b e reached Toward this end French President Jacques Chirac recently commente d that Now is not the time to conduct new studies These studies have alrea dy been done We have to set objectives Specifically European countries wil l proceed with setting specific and targeted cuts in their emission gases suc h as CO produced by power plants powered by fossil fuels The EU has said that if ratified it will comply with the Protocols standards for emissio ns reduction by and go significantly further to reduce emissions beyond that date Yet interestingly across the Continent nuclear power which produces no CO emissions has undergone a resurgence and presently generat es an increasing percentage of the power in countries such as France and Germany However we have a good indication of the specific measures from negotiatio ns that took place during the Clinton administration Most of the emissions targets of the participating countries will be reached through emissiontrading mechanisms Trading emission of greenhouse gases allows industrialized countries to buy emissions rights from each other at a price commonly agreed In other words industrialized countries that do not meet emissions targets can strike deals with other industrialized nations that d o better than required This may encourage reductions to be made where they a re most needed However critics have suggested that the mechanisms amount to loopholes that would allow large polluting countries to continue polluting while smaller countries trade credits that do not amount to significant reductions Moreover the two approaches being pursued by President Bush and the Europe an Union represent inherently different philosophies regarding the urgency of emissions control and methods that should be employed to reduce greenhouse gases There is little possibility that President Bush will change his stan d and include the United States in the Kyoto Protocol Without US participation the Protocol may once again be stalled unless another large industrialized country such as Japan decides to join On his own President Bush now moves forward with constructing a plan for the United States that attempts to balance the reduction of emissions while aggressively expanding the countrys generation supply This will be a difficult balance to achiev e but the president remains confident that environmental protection and industrial expansion do not need to be mutually exclusive An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day Your company can schedule a

Pursues Italys Montedison Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEPower giant Electricitde France EDF has sent shock waves through Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise its stake in electric firm Montedison to percent from about percent However Romano Prodi the European Union commissioner for competition is considering an intervention in the battle between EDF the French electricity monopoly and the Italian government The latter has passed an ad hoc law restricting EDF to percent of the voting rights for Montedison the Italian electricity supplier spun off by Enel Analysis Once again the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the European power market with EDF playing the staring role For the last year or so as the European Union EU has enacted electric competition across the Continent Frances EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by foreign suppliers Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through its ownership of London Electricity the French power firm has wanted for some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy However the neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market As I have mentioned before in this column France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country As a result EDF which controls approximately percent of the French electric industry may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad until it further opens its own market to competition To date France has only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the EU and EDF has played a large role in this resistance While other European countries such as Germany have opened percent of their markets to competition France has opted for a phasedin approach opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February and August respectively Thus although other companies such as Spains Endesa have attempted to push through barriers to obtain entry into France it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the country Nevertheless EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its holdings in Montedison one of Italys main electricity companies Reports are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison EDF recently said that its stake increased from percent to percent However other reports have indicated that EDF already controls about percent of the capital assets of Montedison Both increases in Montedison were made recently which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market regulatory Consob EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the companys financial assets across Europe However at the same time EDF has also indicated that any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading purposes In other words EDF wants to control the generating assets of Montedison for resale across Europes wholesale market Further with a percent stake EDF would become Montedisons largest shareholder and a major presence in Italys power market even as France remains mostly closed EDFs argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian government The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators In fact EDF has admitted that its strategy is to make percent of its turnover from activities abroad by the end of compared with percent currently Consequently it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its home country for expansion opportunities and these opportunities typically have been in distribution and generation assets Moving forward the company has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation For instance last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for the regional UK electricity company Seeboard which is owned by American Electric Power NYSE AEP Serving about two million connected customers in England Seeboard owns operates and maintains an electricity network of over km miles of overhead lines and underground cables An acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDFs overall expansion efforts in Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity one of regional electricity companies in England and Wales which EDF bought from Entergy in In addition EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden Graninge and Germany EnBW and reportedly is Polands largest electricity distributor These acquisitions were made by EDF International which is wholly owned by the French government and thus subject to EU oversight Perhaps due to EDFs size and presence in Europe these previous acquisitions were allowed without a great deal of EU intervention However now that other countries have voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede it is unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny As noted trading appears to be the next wave of EDFs expansion efforts Toward this end EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in to create an energy trading company called EDF Trading The various companies that EDF has invested in across Europe support the companys efforts to both learn about new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens fully across the Continent For its part the Italian government has responded that it will block any increase of EDFs ownership of Montedison based primarily on the argument that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France Specifically Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison Further outlining its position the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be sold by Enel one of the countrys main power firms As Montedison will be one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel the Italian government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and thus having access to additional power assets in Italy For instance Enel is planning to sell Elettrogen a generation company that produces about percent of the production capacity in Italy If EDF were to increase its stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen then EDF as a foreign entity would gain a lock over the Italian power supply market Italys antiEDF law is an interesting development but it does not mark the first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent Spain also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with regard to the French companys pursuit of Hidrocantabrico Spains fourth largest supplier However despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict any expansion of EDF the laws although they are already in place may ultimately be deemed anticompetitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates antitrust allegations in the United States any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles EDF also remains interested in the Spanishs largest power utility Endesa which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the French electricity market through a percent acquisition of French electricity generator SocieacutetNationale dElectricitet de Thermique Endesa which recently terminated an attempted merger with Iberdrola Spains second largest power firm has been viewed as a takeover target for larger companies such as EDF At last report the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on how far control was being exercised In other words EU intervention will be based on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an increased stake in Montedison The fact that France remains resistant to electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the governments of Italy and Spain An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North

Editors Note Yesterdays IssueAlert incorrectly identified Las Cruces as the town used for an energy management pilot project The correct town is Laredo Texas IMAGE IssueAlert for February Florida Study Recommends Wholesale Deregulation by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis Floridas political and business leaders moved cautiously toward deregulati ng the states electric industry in a move last week while vowing to avoid problems such as those in California Floridas Energy Study Commissio n unanimously recommended that the Florida Legislature consider deregulating wholesale electricity The move could spark construction of a number of pow er plants in the state Analysis Florida Gov Jeb Bush created the Energy Study Commission wi th the intent of submitting an initial deregulation proposal for consideration in this springs legislative session Floridas energy market represents a billion industry so obviously there has been great interest on the par t of new energy suppliers that want to begin serving the state Florida continues to move slowly toward deregulation across all levels Competition on the retail side may take several more years especially as t he California crisis is causing many states to adopt a more cautious approach to removing state regulations The commissions recommendation to initiate deregulation on the wholesale side is considered a small step toward reachi ng the ultimate goal of total deregulation in the state Specifically the commission has endorsed a plan that would allow outofstate companies to build new merchant power plants in Florida and se ll wholesale electricity to the states utilities Florida law forbids outofstate electric utility companies from providing yearround service t o utilities and customers but merchant plants can provide backup service to existing utilities when energy reserves are stretched thin to avoid power outages and rolling brownouts Also under the commissions plan instate utilities would also be allowed to sell their regulated plants at depreciat ed values to affiliated companies that would compete headtohead on the wholesale market In addition the states utilities could engage in longterm power contracts with suppliers instead of relying on the open market a major difference from Californias original plan and state regulators would still review all wholesale contract prices The commission s plan must still be approved by the Florida Legislature and the commission readily admits that approval may not be easily obtained due to the ongoing crisis in California At the present time no official start date for electric competition in Florida has been announced The states go slow approach is characteristi c of other Southeastern US states many of which continue to enjoy comparatively low electric rates Floridas renewed interest in deregulatio n is being driven by the belief among several commission members and other officials that competition eventually will result in lower rates for consumers Or at the very least competition should prevent rates from continuing to increase as they reportedly would under a regulated structure The commissions plan also is intended to prevent power supply problems in Florida similar to those in California by allowing for new generation to b e built in the state by external companies Florida law requires power companies to hold percent of their power supplies in reserve to that the y can handle periods of extreme usage However both the commissions chair a nd Gov Bush have suggested that Florida will face a shortage of electricity i n the next decade unless outofstate companies build new plants Consumer groups and municipal electric providers have resisted the commissions recommendation In general such groups fear that deregulating Floridas wholesale market would lead to higher electricity bills since big utilities in the state would be allowed to earn higher profits that may or may not result in benefits for consumers In fact the Florida Municipal Electric Association recently argued that annual electricity prices in Florida would rise by between million and billion if the commissions plan to initiate wholesale deregulation is approved In addition Floridas utilities have been rather effective in persuading stat e officials to move slowly toward deregulation perhaps out of concern about losing their monopoly status Walter Revell the chairman of the Energy Study Commission denied that the group is considering any plan that would be partial to the states largest investorowned utilities which include Florida Power Light Tampa Electric Florida Power Corp and Gulf Power The commissions recommendation supports what is already a fastgrowing wholesale business in the state of Florida with outside power companies su ch as Duke Enron Calpine Corp and others aggressively trying to penetrate t he state and gain a foothold for when deregulation emerges in full force Such power suppliers may be accurately surmising that Florida is headed toward a supply demand imbalance as has occurred in California An imbalance of this sort would offer competitive opportunities for power suppliers in the state According to a report in the St Petersburg Times merchant power companies have announced plans to build some plants across Florida just over the last year or so However the article stated that the Floridas bi g utility companies still have enough clout to block any plant proposal For instance Florida Power Florida Power Light and Tampa Electric joine d forces last year to block Duke Energy from constructing a plant near Dayton a Beach Yet Duke pushes forward and recently said that it would revive plan s to build a merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach Fla Dukes plans to build t he plant had previously been blocked by a Florida Supreme Court ruling that su ch plants were prohibited under state law Enron unveiled plans for two peaker plants in Pompano and Deerfield Beach Fla several weeks ago Construction on both sites is pending city and sta te environmental department approval but Enron hopes to have both MW facilities running by summer Enron expects the Department of Environmental Protection to license each peaker plant for days each yea r with roughly days powered by natural gas and the rest by oil Enron is also in the preliminary stages of planning a mile liquefied natural gas LNG pipeline between the Bahamas and Port Everglades Fla The company ha s an option on a acre site in the harbor of Grand Bahamas Island where it hopes to build a conversion and treatment terminal for LNG Calpine received approval to build a MW natural gasfired plant to supp ly electricity to Seminole Electric Cooperative The plant will be part of the proposed Osprey Energy Center in Aurburndale Fla next to an existing Calpine MW cogeneration plant According to Calpine beginning in June Seminole Electric Cooperative will distribute electricity from Osprey for years to member electric cooperatives Reliant Energy is also finding its own way to penetrate the new openings in to the Florida market Just last week Reliant Energy Services an unregulated wholesale power subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced that it has entered into agreements with affiliates of El Paso Energy Corp to purchase future supplies of power from several new facilities to be built in Florida Under the tolling agreements Reliant Energy Services has secured the right to utilize and dispatch electric generating capacity totaling approximately MW The electricity will be generated by two new naturalgas fired simplecycle peaking plants to be owned by El Paso Energy that will be located in Pasco and Hardee counties The new plants are scheduled to be completed by the spring and summer of These are just a few examples of the many companies that plan to take competitive advantage of the anticipated opening of Floridas market While Florida clearly has no plan to open deregulation on the consumer level any time soon competition in the state does appear to be gaining momentum at least on the wholesale level Of course the commissions plan has not yet been fully approved by the Florida Legislature and critics claim that the states big utilities still wield a great deal of influence over the extent to which competing power suppliers will be allowed to participate in the states market There are many debatable nuances within the Florida commissions plan Yet one positive thing is that Florida does appear to b e making valuable steps to increase its own power supply addressing a proble m that many have accused California of ignoring Having learned the lesson fr om California Florida seemingly acknowledges that there is simply no guarante e that

to Exelon Sale Supports Strategies of Both Companies By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from PRNewswire TXU Corp NYSE TXU and Exelon Generation ann ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gasfired electric generating pla nts to Exelon Generation a subsidiary of Exelon Corp NYSE EXC for million The transaction involving two DallasFort Worth plants with a co mbined capacity of MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres ence in the Texas region enhancing its geographic and market diversity wh ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas Analysis Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st rategies of both companies particularly well TXU one of the largest gener ation companies in the world has been attempting to expand out of its home state of Texas for some time following competitive opportunities as they are presented by electric deregulation The company which will maintain a presence in the Texas market has already expanded internationally into cou ntries such as Australia and Europe and will mostly likely use the proceed s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni ted States For Exelon the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex as market which becomes fully competitive next week and provides a partic ularly valuable inroad into the highdemand region of DallasFort Worth Lets first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is selling to Exelon As noted the combined capacity of the two plants is abo ut MW One of the plants is the MW Handley Steam Electric Stati on which is located southeast of Fort Worth According to TXU bar rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oilgas units at the plant Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington The first unit was put into operation in with the additional units coming on line in and The other plant being sold is the MW Mountain Creek St eam Electric Station which is located about two miles west of Loop in D allas With the first oilgas unit established in four more units wer e added in and Both sales include the generating un its of the plants along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo r them to operate land water rights transmission interconnections gas p ipeline interconnections production facilities and emission allowances The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr etty straightforward From TXUs perspective the sales will reduce the com panys generation concentration in a single US market which up to this p oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas Proceeds from the sale apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke ts outside of Texas In addition proceeds from the sale will be used to st rengthen TXUs balance sheet by reducing debt something that has become in creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s pace since the bankruptcy of marketleader Enron It is important to note t hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market and still intends to operate in the state as a generation company and retailer Note that according to Texas restructuring law there must be a wall between the two operating uni ts which must function as separate companies In essence the divestiture is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w ill support growth into other markets and reduce the amount of potential m arket power that the company may have in Texas The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l atter half of this year considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene rgy Regulatory Commission FERC have forced several other companies to cha rge costbased prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to hold market power in their particular service territories Texas law allow s a company to own and control no more than percent of capacity within t he Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT and TXU claims that it is within this cap However TXU acknowledges that it had an overconcentrati on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar kets Excluding the sold facilities TXU will now own MW of net capa city which are still located primarily in Texas However it is becoming c lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market From Exelons perspective the sale expands the companys generating capaci ty by about percent which is an important increase considering that Exe lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industrys largest assetbased traders Exelon which was created as a result of the merger b etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison is known mostly for its strong nuclear capabilities In fact Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry owning a total of reactors that produce about MW of power Exelon may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio Exelo n Power which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU ov ersees Exelons portfolio of coal natural gas oil landfill gas and hydr o generating assets which include intermediate and peaking units in Pen nsylvania and Maryland capable of producing MW of net generating cap acity Thus Exelons purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e ffort to diversify both regionally and from a powersource perspective fr om the companys previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast Perhaps equally important the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas market which represents the secondlargest energy market behind Californ ia offering a market value of about billion Now that California is n o longer a competitive energy market there are high hopes that Texas will prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state next week On Jan most customers of investorowned utilities in Te xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider REPth e company that provides their electricity As a whole the Texas energy mar ket represents MW of generation operating on a mile transmiss ion network One of Exelons main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as sets and position itself as one of the nations toptier energy suppliers Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon which up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago to Pennsylvania This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into the Texas market In the summer of Exelon began operating a new MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston Prior to that Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from two other plants in Texas MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and M W from the Wolf Hollow plant It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma rket especially on the wholesale side of the business and thus there are fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract Unde r the sales agreement Exelon Power Exelon Generations power plant operat ion arm will assume operation of the plants The transaction includes a to lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe r during summer months for the next five years at marketbased rates Consi dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement it is presumed that TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the summer months of the fiveyear contract and then purchasing the electric o utput of the plants during that time Interestingly TXU is able to abide b y Texas requirement that it not own and control more than percent withi n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants However realisti cally TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants at least in the summer months during its fiveyear contract with Exelon T his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas

McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEIntroduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corps CEO Chris Hamilos President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this morning at the th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque NM The st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career and reiterated his strong support for his son President George W Bush whom he affectionately refers to as as in rd president The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy However the former president did field questions from the audience regarding a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he faced in his administration and those that are presently challenging his son Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current presidents justreleased energy task plan a page report that outlines approximately steps that the new administration will take to address current energy problems Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia The former president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against Saddam Hussein who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world Further President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his presidency during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress that saw the big picture issues in a different light often made it difficult to find common ground The former president made only brief but rather significant references to his sons new energy policy Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney last evening former President Bush said he was aware that the new broadbased plan focused heavily on new supply along with secondary measures for conservation efforts This is an approach that the former president fully supports as he noted that if you want to lower energy prices you need to establish more supply In addition the former president offered that additional drilling efforts an element of the plan that has sparked a great deal of controversy has to happen if the nation is truly committed to increasing supply However former President Bush did suggest that the nation must be patient as it will take several years to see any significant decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new development efforts Meanwhile the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate As expected the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge easing of cleanair rules that should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit process for oil refinery expansion and construction These platforms have been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan However new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few days are raising the most eyebrows For instance the extent to which nuclear power factors into the administrations energy plan is perhaps greater than was previously anticipated Specifically the Bush plan proposes the extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of socalled breeder reactors which use spent nuclear fuel Breeder reactors although rather common in Europe and Japan have not been used in the United States since the s when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce nuclear weapongrade plutonium as a byproduct Other key elements of the plan include Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government which would supersede states rights to approve new transmission line capacity Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting and speeding up the relicensing requirements for nuclear plants Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury which are common byproducts of coalfired production In turn the Bush administration supports exploring new cleancoal technologies which should increase production by coalfired generating plants A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air Act which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power plants The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued As has been the case since the start of the new administration the continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and strong on new supply efforts while remaining vague and noncommittal to conservation efforts However the specific conservation proposals in the energy plan include providing consumers billion in tax credits through to encourage the purchase of highmileage gaselectric hybrid vehicles In addition President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to cogeneration plants which produce both heat and electricity Others including the current presidents father might argue that conservation efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as market forces high prices already are driving renewed conservation across the country Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that often thwarted his policy measures the current President Bush continues to buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy plan In fact just two days ago a group of House Democrats led by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMiss outlined a plan that calls for increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan However Democrats have focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan as illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles Consequently the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and Democrats to support cooperation in Congress That cooperation may be necessary as Congress must approve President Bushs energy plan in order for it to take effect TOMORROW Summary of CIS Conference and analysis of key IT issues facing the energy

Reuters Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN agreed on Nov to acquir e rival Enron Corp NYSE ENE for some billion in stock underlining t he dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houstonbased energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly billion Enrons stock fell sharpl y in the past month due to investors concerns about murky transactions tha t sparked an investigation by US regulators and damaging downgrades by cr edit rating agencies The merged company will retain the Dynegy name It wi ll have annual revenues of more than billion and assets worth bill ion including more than megawatts of electricity generating capacit y and miles of naturalgas pipelines It will be North Americas big gest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity positions previous ly held by Enron Analysis Well its now official The announcement of what presumably will be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end o f last week It is indeed a dramatic end Enron the maverick and innovativ e company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated m arkets in the energy industry will no longer exist after what has been a v ery quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months Dy negy the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach toward success is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and l ocking in much of the industry market share of Enron Can there be any doub t that this is the energy industrys manifestation of the tortoise and the hare parable Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy but is making a sm art choice to be bought considering its desperate circumstances and the un likelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own For Dynegy this acquisition is a major win as the combination will create the biggest and strongest energy merchant in the world There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal Before addre ssing some issues related to the approval of the deal lets establish some of the key points of the merger agreement There have been some mixed repo rts but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about a share quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was tra ding at close to a share and had a market value of nearly billion Under terms of the agreement Enron shareholders will receive Dynegy shares per share of Enron common stock Dynegys current stockholders inc luding ChevronTexaco Corp which currently owns percent of Dynegy will own approximately percent of the combined company while Enrons stockh olders will own approximately percent of the combined companys stock at closing In addition Dynegy will provide an immediate billion assetbacked equ ity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined comp any by ChevronTexaco Chuck Watson chairman and CEO of Dynegy will retain his position at the new company Steve Bergstrom president of Dynegy and Rob Doty chief financial officer will retain their positions at the new company It is not presently known what role if any Ken Lay current CEO of Enron will hold at the new company Of course this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fal len into a very vulnerable spot this year Quite literally Enron was pushe d into this deal because it was running out of cash its stock had tanked a nd its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels all within the last several weeks Enrons decline over the course of has been the result of losses in its telecom sector losses from its involvement in India the departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling a Securities and Exchange Co mmission SEC investigation into some of its business practices and lack of investor confidence about Enrons honesty in its financial reporting Th is last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had ov erstated earnings by percent over the last four years and investors shou ld disregard the companys financial statements from through the first half of The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced million from Enrons reported profits In addition Enron revised its debt upward in each year from to At the end of Enrons de bt was billion million more than it had previously reported B y not reporting this debt earlier Enron presumably was able to maintain a stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been dis closed The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enrons successful energy t rading business In addition Dynegy could also find synergies in Enrons r etail unit Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline the companys electronic trading unit Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect whi ch was launched after Enron gained the firststrike advantage in this marke t space Details are still emerging but it would make sense if Dynegy opte d to not purchase other units under Enrons business structure such as the companys water and telecom businesses which are losing money Dynegy has its own telecom unit which has also lost money this year so it may not w ant to expand in this slowgrowing sector at this time Vivendi Environneme nt a French company that has expanded into various lines of business has reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix Enro ns struggling water subsidiary Note that Enron sold Azurix North America to American Water Works The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dyn egy and Enron shareholders Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent u pon any possible downgrades on its longterm debt that Dynegy could encount er with the purchase of Enron At this juncture it does not appear that Dy negy will be downgraded but this is a fastchanging story and conditions c ould change abruptly Financing the deal may also be an issue even with th e infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco Dynegy reportedly has billion worth of debt and has a market capitalization of billion Thus Enron s own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb a concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal This issue co uld be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enrons assets and if there is some repair work done on Enrons balance sheets The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult as the combination of the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market po wer and antitrust issues The review of this merger will be unprecedented considering that the wholesale naturalgas and electricity trading market i s still fairly young Certainly a deal of this magnitude has not previousl y occurred in the deregulating energy industry It is not presently clear w hich regulatory agency will be involved in the review although the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department could all be involved FERC would most likely become inv olved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset su ch as a pipeline FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured so lely as an exchange of stock Not involving FERC would be more advantageous for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly s horter An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items fo r regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dyne gy would hold market power in the naturalgas trading space which could pr eempt market entry by other competitors The combined company would be con siderably larger than its nearest competitors Scope and scale are consider ed the top competitive assets in the trading sector and the combination of Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance It will fa ll on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it p recludes other competitors from emerging into the same space To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatem ent The two rival companies followed very different paths to success Enro n under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular espoused an unor thodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order to achieve success in the energytrading space Dynegy on the other hand approached the market from the opposite perspective and diligently acquir ed diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally t o support its trading operation Up until the start of it appeared th at Enrons strategy was the more successful of the two Enron with bi llion in revenues and billion in profits in ranked fifth on Fortun e s list of largest US companies In contrast Dynegy ranked on th e same list and had billion in revenues and million in earnings H owever turned out to be Dynegys year and the success continued into the very year that would bring Enrons downfall Enrons problems cul minated in million in losses in the third quarter after taking billion in charges associated with several of its noncore businesses Take n with the other factors plaguing the company Enron became exceptionally v ulnerable and prone to a takeover which has now provided Dynegy with a str ong gain The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegys size and should imm ediately provide an accretive earnings contribution Further Dynegy claims that it expects a to percent annual earnings growth over the next t hree years following its planned acquisition of Enron If it gains all of t he necessary regulatory approvals Dynegy will become the undisputed market leader in the energy industry with annual revenues of billion and billion in assets The company will have MW of generating capacity which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating MW by In other words the combined company will dwarf any oth er competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its neare st competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size resources an d assets Word of the acquisition caused Enrons shares to increase some one of the few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months S hares of Enron rose cents or percent to in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov As of early morning trade on Nov Enron shares were priced at Shares of Dynegy gained or percent to in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is

Pacific Gas Electric Co NYSE PCG the utility unit of PGOCorp on Friday filed for reorganization under Chapter Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco The company said it is taking this action in light of its uncollected energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Gov Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Pacific Gas Electric Co reportedly has more than billion in uncollected costs for wholesale power purchases Neither PGOCorp nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing Analysis Despite the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing has been in the making for several months and that its financial insolvency appeared inevitable the actual filing for Chapter protection on Friday caught many by surprise including Californias top officials Ironically the utilitys million customers may end up being the least impacted by the bankruptcy as Pacific Gas Electric Co will remain in the business of providing power while it works its way through bankruptcy court However there is little doubt that the bankruptcy filing of Californias largest utility will spark many reverberations throughout the state and across the country the full impact of which is not presently known There naturally is a great deal of industry press surrounding this major news so I wont waste time regurgitating information that is being widely disseminated Rather I will focus on what I believe to be some of the key elements of this story The bankruptcy was announced the day after it became clear to PGOthat the state of California would not be purchasing its transmission assets at a price that PGObelieves the assets to be worth In addition a new rate increase approved by the governor could not be used to repay any of Pacific Gas Electric Cos existing debts The night before the bankruptcy filing Gov Davis delivered a televised address to the state in which he indicated that the rate increases would be contingent on PGOselling the transmission assets to the state In other words if PGOagreed to the states price for the transmission assets a portion of the rate increase would be used to alleviate the utilitys subsequent debts The inside word is that Pacific Gas Electric Co was finally driven to its bankruptcy decision due to disagreements with Gov Davis regarding the price of the transmission assets which could be anywhere from billion to billion Officially Pacific Gas Electric Co said that its negotiations with the state were going nowhere The CPUC had previously approved rate increases of up to percent for the customers of SCE and Pacific Gas Electric Co but clearly stipulated that none of this added revenue could be used to pay off existing debt In his statewide address on the eve of the bankruptcy Gov Davis reluctantly announced an additional rate increase for nonresidential customers that would average about percent Davis had fiercely resisted any form of a rate increase to accommodate Pacific Gas Electric Cos debt The official PGOresponse to both increases was that they were insufficient to pay off existing debts of the utility operation PGOCorp and other nonutility subsidiaries are not impacted by the bankruptcy measure at least for now Due to a shrewd financial restructuring that was approved by FERC a few months ago see Issue Alert for more information highprofit subsidiaries such as National Energy Group and PGOGas Transmission Northwest Corp were placed into a specialpurpose bankruptcy remote entity known as GTN Holdings LLC Consequently these nonregulated subsidiaries along with the parent corporation may not be impacted by the utilitys bankruptcy filing The US federal bankruptcy judge ultimately may take a closer look at how profits were divided among the parent operation and other nonregulated subsidiaries but for the time being only Pacific Gas Electric Co has declared bankruptcy Power suppliers still owed money by PGOcould likely never get paid Much of Pacific Gas Electric Cos billion debt is owed to power suppliers that sold power to the utility over the last year or so With the onset of lengthy legal proceedings it becomes more unlikely that these power suppliers will be paid what they are owed any time soon Consequently power suppliers owed more than million by Pacific Gas Electric Co also saw their stocks drop as a reaction to the bankruptcy announcement According to a report in Reuters Duke Energy NYSE DUK was down or percent at Dynegy Corp NYSE DYN was off or percent at Williams Companies NYSE WMB was or percent lower at and Reliant Energy NYSE REI lost or percent to In addition there is the real question of whether or not such power suppliers will be willing to provide power used by a bankrupt company even if the state of California remains involved as the buying intermediary For its part PGOCorp Chairman Bob Glynn said that the utility subsidiary intends to eventually pay all our debt in full but he did not report a specific figure In addition to the power suppliers banks that have provided loans to Pacific Gas Electric Co such as Bank of America Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase could all be impacted by the bankruptcy Pacific Gas Electric Cos preliminary bankruptcy filing lists its top creditor as Bank of New York to which it owes more than billion Although some payments may be made after years of litigation such lenders and bondholders may be forced to write off billions of dollars that were previously advanced to Pacific Gas Electric Co as losses The blame game is in full force Davis and state regulators have repeatedly blamed outofstate generators for price gouging and federal regulators for failing to impose wholesale rate caps on electricity prices Also Gov Davis has issued harsh words against PGE Over the weekend Davis appeared on two nationally televised news programs to berate PGOfor awarding an estimated million in bonuses and raises to about midlevel managers and support staff on the eve of the utilitys bankruptcy filing Management at PGOis just focused upon padding their own pockets not in discharging their duty to serve their many customers in California Davis reportedly said Earlier Davis had previously issued a statement saying PGOmanagement is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed In addition California regulators have criticized FERC for not implementing wholesale price caps in the Western region which they believe would help to stabilize the market in California US Sen Dianne Feinstein said that it is inexcusable that FERC has refused to intervene and provide temporary stability and reliability through the use of wholesale price caps Feinstein vowed to introduce legislation to force federally mandated price caps for the entire Western region For its part FERC refused to take responsibility for the California crisis saying instead that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing was the unfortunate result of a massive failure by policymakers at all levels PGOblames decisions made by the CPUC and Gov Davis that it believes undermined its ability to return to financial viability and recover its uncollected costs Specifically PGOblames the California government for not allowing it to recover prior wholesale power costs through recent rate increases which essentially has kept the utility in a debt situation PGOalso believed that the governor was not moving quickly enough to reach an agreement regarding the sale of PGEs transmission system to the state Consumer groups continue to lambaste the utility and its parent company which they claim has billion in available capital that could have been used to pull its subsidiary out of debt Could the bankruptcy filing of SCE be far behind The secondlargest utility in California continues to maintain that it intends to avoid bankruptcy and it believes it can work out a comprehensive solution to our current crisis However because the two utilities have been so closely linked through the states energy crisis PGEs decision to declare bankruptcy certainly raises the odds that SCE will eventually follow suit In fact Moodys Investors Service is reporting that Pacific Gas and Electric Cos bankruptcy increases the possibility of an SCE bankruptcy filing Further Moodys is reporting that numerous creditor groups particularly the small generators have become impatient with the time that it has taken to advance settlement discussions with the state of California thereby increasing the prospects for an involuntary petition by a group of creditors On April the day of Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing shares of SCE tumbled or nearly percent to finish trading at Surprisingly SCE shares jumped about by midmorning on April to trade at about The reason for the increase is not fully known although SCE continues to remain involved in negotiations with Gov Davis regarding its own outstanding debt This is just the start of a long drawn out legal process The electric utilities that previously declared bankruptcy including El Paso Electric Public Service Company of New Hampshire and El Paso Electric all found themselves embroiled in legal proceedings for several years Thus although we may not know the ultimate outcome for Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings we do know that the company will be essentially consumed with litigation and a thorough investigation of its financial records for the foreseeable future Federal Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco has been assigned the PGOcase Montali will have the ultimate power to approve or reject any plan for how PGOreorganizes or arranges to repay its debt Several positive elements of the process that might work to PGEs advantage is that the utility will now be held accountable to only one individual Judge Montali Pacific Gas Electric Co will no longer have to appease several regulatory entities across state and federal lines Second by the time that the bankruptcy proceedings are completed market dynamics hopefully will have improved and Californias supply problem should be resolved Consequently Pacific Gas Electric Co could eventually rise again like the phoenix out of its ashes and emerge as a much stronger company than it is today An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

Issue By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Reuters US regulators met with California state energy o fficials on Sept as part of ongoing mediation efforts to determine pote ntial refunds in the Western power market a spokeswoman for the Federal En ergy Regulatory Commission FERC said Separately a House of Representati ves panel signaled a possible probe into alleged price manipulation by two governmentcontrolled California bodies that buy power for the state accor ding to a memo obtained by Reuters FERC will facilitate meetings with the California Independent System Operator ISO the California Department of Water Resourcesthe states main power buyerseven private energy firms an d the states investorowned utilities FERC is concerned that reliability is being compromised on the California power grid Andrea Wolfman a lawy er in FERCs enforcement office wrote in a letter dated Sept obtained by Reuters Analysis In one of the lingering issues of the California energy crisis th at has yet to be resolved FERC California officials and representatives f rom outofstate power generators seem only incrementally closer to reachin g a consensus on the refund issue which has been under debate for most of this year Two months ago with California and power generators already loc ked in a stalemate over the states demand for billion in wholesale el ectricity refunds FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner halted negot iations on July and declared that he would draft a refund plan At that t ime Judge Wagner made it clear that while he had not calculated the amoun t refunds would be returned to California and that the vast majority of th e methodology presented by the California delegation would be adopted in hi s recommendation Nevertheless the issue still remains unresolved and now faces a new wrinkle alleged market manipulation on the part of the Califor nia ISO and Department of Water Resources the two state agencies with the biggest hand in wholesale transactions in California It is also important to note at the onset that Judge Wagner disclosed on Ju ly that power generators had offered a settlement of million which California officials flatly refused Of that amount reportedly millio n was offered by the five biggest generatorsDuke Dynegy Mirant Reliant and Williams Californias rejection of the offer signaled the end of the negotiations In any case the general message from Judge Wagner was one of support for the generators and a belief that any possible refunds would fa ll closer to a billion level rather than billion Nevertheless now t hat Judge Wagner has made his recommendations to FERC he has apparently st epped out of these negotiations In addition to the California ISO and the three California IOUs Pacific Ga s Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric the seven outofstate energy companies that are participating in the nego tiations on refunds are Calpine NYSE CPN Duke Energy DUK Dynegy DY N Enron ENE Reliant REI Mirant MIR and Williams WMB All of th ese companies are subject to potential refunds and as a result have seen th eir stocks fluctuate on the basis of positive or negative projections In a nutshell negotiations among the various parties stalled due to quantitati ve dispute over the amount of money that is owed to California Gov Gray D avis wont budge regarding his claim that generators owe the state nearly billion Most of the generators have consented to paying some amount of r efund but claim that the figure should be no more than billion as a who le adding that any amount above this figure would be unjustified The wide range between the two amounts is what caused the negotiations to hit a bri ck wall and caused Judge Wagner to assume responsibility for a final recomm endation to FERC The stakes in this decision are huge as Judge Wagners r efund plan and FERCs subsequent ruling based on its own conclusions will undoubtedly set a precedent for how wholesale power is bought and sold in US markets that are subsequently deregulated The other point of contention for the outofstate generators is that the C alifornia ISO has reportedly not yet provided any detailed breakdown of dat a related to energy consumption by the California IOUs With what they deem as insufficient data in hand the generating companies are reticent to mak e any further refunds related to what they may or may not owe the state Al so at issue is whether or not previous refund demands made by the state of California included transactions that were manually completed or transactio ns that were in the process of being filled the omissions of which could h ave artificially inflated the actual refund amount Further the generators maintain that their prices only reflected market conditions and that they are still owed billions from the state of California In fairness the actual dollar amount that the state of California may have been overcharged remains ambiguous because up to this point power genera tors have also refused to provide data showing their actual cost of produci ng power as this represents competitive information Rather all of the pa rties involved in the negotiations have made presentations to Judge Wagner and naturally have made the best case to support their various positions This could all change if the dispute makes its way to a fullblown federal trial as power generators and state officials for that matter might be forced to turn over proprietary operational data Moreover outofstate power generators have long been accused of price man ipulation by Gov Davis Now however the new claims are being leveled aga inst the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources As a reminde r the California ISO manages the states power grid with a mission to ensu re that the grid is safe and reliable and that there is a competitive marke t for electricity in California The Department of Water Resources assumed the unprecedented role of Californias main power purchaser in January when the creditworthy status of the three IOUs became questionable Specif ically according to the Reuters report FERC is concerned that reliabili ty is being compromised on the California power grid by the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO In addition the buying practices of the Department of Water Resources have also been brought into question The accusation waged against the two agen cies is essentially that the Department of Water Resources has spent an exo rbitant amount of money for power through longterm contracts that it estab lished when electricity prices soared from an average of MWh to over MWh earlier this year Prices have now fallen to about MWh due to cooler weather trends and reduced demand FERCs concern according to the memo obtained by Reuters is that the California ISO is now purchasing surp lus power from the Department of Water Resources at high prices to protect Gov Davis from embarrassment related to the high price that the state is s till paying for power These accusations may fall under the investigation o f the US House Committee on Government Reform but at least in this inter im period are another sticking point for FERC in the refund negotiations However from my perspective these new accusations against the California ISO and Department of Water Resources do represent an entirely separate iss ue from the refundfromgenerators issue Apart from everything else the t imeframe for which the refunds are being assessed is limited to October through May This time period may or may not overlap with any allege d market manipulation on the part of the two California state agencies In any case this issue will likely be sorted out through legislative interven tion and will probably be kept separate from the refund issue Although much of this case still remains in contention some key factors ar e fairly undisputed For instance FERC has established that it is only see king to establish a ruling based on three key areas refunds of overcharges longterm power contracts and debts owed to generators by California uti lities Also as noted it is clear that the time period for which power ge nerators may ultimately have to issue refunds is October through May Any overcharging that might have occurred outside of this timeframe is beyond the scope of this investigation and would not be included in any re funds made by the generators It is also important to note that according to a report issued by the California Energy Commission other companies suc h as Destec and NRG also participate as nonutility generators in the Calif ornia market and are presumably also under investigation However both of these companies have partnerships with Dynegy which may have had the more active role in determining wholesale prices in the state In addition FERC has previously stated that it would be using its new price methodology as a basis to determine any potential refunds The price control methodology issued in June set an initial price ceiling of MWh for wholesa le power sales which is considerably lower than the average price screen p ut into place by FERCs original order Power generators will not be permit ted to sell above the mitigated prices in the Western markets Regarding the refund dispute Gov Davis maintains that the billion in refunds a figure that was calculated by the California ISO is an accurat e amount and one that is nonnegotiable Davis acknowledges that the figure includes potential overcharges from governmentrun operations such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP and BC Hydro which FERC does not regulate If the municipal utilities are not included in the equat ion California officials allege that the power generators listed above col lectively owe the state around billion Yet when considering other West ern states besides California that may also seek refunds from the power gen erators the potential refund claimed by the states could reach as high as billion Records provided to Judge Wagner by California officials indic ate that in January the first month in which the Department of Water Resources started to serve as the states power purchaser California spent about per megawatthour for power on the wholesale spot market Typically the contracts already signed by the governor are in place for years and were based on higherthancosttoservice rates Some reports ha ve indicated that the longterm contracts make the state liable for bil lion in power payments over the next decade At the time the contracts were signed Davis felt pressure to ensure that California had a reliable suppl y of power but he reportedly has been criticized for locking the state int o expensive longterm agreements and is eager to renegotiate them While D avis is flexible on the various forms that the refunds could take he has s aid they have to net out close to billion However some of the pow er generators that established contracts with the state say renegotiation is not possible as they have already locked themselves into deals with natu ralgas suppliers An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwscientechcom issuealert We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments We look

Industry Analysis rciwsimageswillbordercopyjpg News item from Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission F ERC kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r ules requiring utilities to turn control of their powergrid assets to inde pendent management The controversial effort to carve up the nations elect ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat ions RTOs is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III The workshop s dubbed RTO Week were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls buy in for the effort which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie s state regulators and members of Congress Analysis The objective of this weeks workshops may be to gain support fro m the industry for FERCs controversial mandate but they are also having t he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERCs jurisdic tional boundaries The issue has become rather evenly divided On one side critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order which as noted has become somewhat of a cause clbre for new Chairman Wood O n the other hand supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s uppliers into the nations transmission system By Woods own directive th e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin g point as a Dec deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u tilities is fast approaching Certainly the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman after replacing Curt H bert last month has signaled a new era for the federal commission which oversees much of the energy industrys wholesale market and the nations po wer grid As noted Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key objectives Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec by which time transmis sionowning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities Using what he has referred to as a big stick Wood warned that failing to comply with the D ec deadline would cost transmissionowning utilities their right to cha rge marketbased rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in which the utilities might become engaged This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand but has also sparked an inte nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul ating energy market Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints on FERCs authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional leaders who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers State regulators p articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ ely low argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is S uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight rather than c ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC and also believe t hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n ations transmission system is managed Also in question is the extent to w hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen d state boundaries Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERCs authority to force it to participate in an RTO In its July order FERC directed Southern Comp any along with the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Corp and Grid South to form a single RTO for the Southeast region most likely adopting a structur e modeled after Grid South However Southern Company already has sunk abou t billion into its own mile system over which it wants to retain independent control FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced However Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co uld run as high as million which could be passed on to customers in t he form of higher rates Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph ical point of view and questions whether or not the commissions vision of four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient On e of Southerns concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la rge and end up operating like monopolies Ironically the issue has caused dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant which as an i ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid Whil e Southern disagrees with FERCs authority to force RTO participation Mira nt supports the federal governments efforts to streamline transmission act ivity Leaders of RTO Westthe transmission entity in which FERC wants to include the transmission assets of states in the Northwest Southwest and Californi aalso question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC s authority to mandate this structure Leaders in the region have said tha t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates con sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity to meet high demand in the area In other words although FERC may be endor sing marketbased rates for those transmissionowning utilities that join R TOs some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre ased activity Nevertheless along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D ynegy and Enron which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems Hence t hese companies agree with FERCs emphasis on RTO formations as generation companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f rom utilities to independent management companies In addition to the RTO issue the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas E lectric Co have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio nal authority to a head The utilitys parent PGE Corp is pursuing a rin g fencing strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi ngs of Pacific Gas Electric Co Put simply PGE Corp is trying to prote ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new federally regulat ed subsidiary The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca use the California Public Utility Commission which presently regulates the utility operations of Pacific Gas Electric Co believes that it has the right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary Further th e state government in California believes that PGE Corps plan would give too much regulatory control to FERC and by the same token reduce the amou nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr esently contained in a regulated subsidiary The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder al legal system In fact last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen ts from federal lawyers state regulators and private industry addressing not only FERCs authority to mandate RTOs but also the commissions or der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s ystems Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat ion in an RTO At present the commission had danced around the issue by ca lling for voluntary participation yet still affixing stiff penalties for utilities that refuse to comply In addition Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the Energy and Air Qual ity Subcommittee is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session which cou ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl y November Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs and his draft bill repor tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr ivate utilities that own power lines At the same time however it is beli eved that Bartons draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERCs order which again w ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on transmission issues Moreover Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d ebate over FERCs authority as disputes between state and federal regulator y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge Howe ver given FERCs deadline of Dec for RTO participation the issue has gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in their heels and rebuff the federal commissions mandate An

April SCE Agrees to Sell Transmission Assets to California by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis At a joint press conference with Governor Gray Davis Edison International Chairman President and CEO John Bryson announced agreement on a plan to restore Southern California Edison SCE to financial health The negotiat ed resolution with the Governor is far preferable for our company our employe es and for our customers than is going into bankruptcy Bryson said The key part of the agreement is that the state will receive a primary utility asse t SCEs mile transmission system SCE employees will operate and maintain the system through a contractual arrangement with the state Analysis Only days after Pacific Gas Electric Co its California utilit y counterpart declared bankruptcy SCE announced what is being billed as a pact with the State of California that should keep it out of bankruptcy court From all appearances this seems to be a strong deal for SCE as it not only keeps the utility financially solvent but also removes it from a line of business that remains rather uncertain and financially unrewarding First lets establish the key aspects of the agreement Keep in mind that the California Legislature the California Public Utilities Commission CPU C and federal regulators must approve this deal Edison International NYSE EIX the parent of SCE has agreed to sell the utilitys transmission asse ts to the State of California for billion The confirmed price tag that the state is paying for SCEs lines seems like a generous offer because it is about times the systems current book value of billion the origin al cost less any accumulated depreciation OCLD recorded in SCEs books Since transmission rates are based on an allowed rate of return on OCLD it is uncertain that SCEs current transmission rates will provide sufficient revenues for the state to cover its purchase cost The sale includes only SCEs transmission assets It appears that SCE will remain in the distribution business and continue delivering power to customers and running generation Both the state and SCE have agreed to commit to no less than billion of capital investment in utility infrastructure over the next five years which presumably includes upgrades to the transmission system and new generation capacity It is not entirely clear at this time how the billion in capital investment will be shared between the State of California and SCE Edison officials also have agreed to sell costbased not marketbased electricity to the state from power generated at SCE plants Edison Mission Energy the unregulated subsidiary of Edison International is also obligat ed to sell output from its Sunrise power plant exclusively to California under costbased pricing Although SCE divested much of its power assets under agreements with the CPUC it still shares ownership of the San Onofre Nucle ar Plant Units and with San Diego Gas Electric SDGE and shares in the Palo Verde Mohave and Four Corners generating stations SCE also owns hydroelectric facilities and the Pebbly Beach generating facility The Sunrise Mission power project is a gasfired power plant that is currently under construction Reportedly the Sunrise plant is expected to provide about MW of electricity during peak periods of demand this summer According to the Memorandum of Understanding between SCE and the California Department of Water Resources SCEs generation assetsincluding all en ergy capacity ancillary services and any combination thereofwill be commit ted to costbased ratemaking for SCEs bundled service customers In addition SCE is prohibited from selling any of these generation assets until Dec Also included within the agreement is SCEs commitment to dismiss all pendi ng lawsuits against the CPUC related to market prices in California Edison International also has agreed to refund million to the utility unit th at reportedly had been paid in dividends to the parent company The billion that the state is paying SCE for its transmission assets can be used to pay preexisting debt to creditors including power generato rs that have previously sold power to SCE This is the essential benefit that the utility receives in the deal and it is a considerable achievement given that the liquid capital theoretically should stave off bankruptcy proceedings It is also important to note that this is the first revenue stream that has been specifically earmarked for SCEs preexisting debts Recent rate increases that have been approved by the CPUC can only be appli ed to subsequent debts incurred by the utility In addition SCE will be allow ed to issue bonds to recover a substantial portion of the approximate billion in debt that the utility has accrued due to uncollected purchases o f wholesale power The agreement should return SCEs debt to investment grade making it easier for the company to raise money to fund future operations By reducing its debt load Edison CEO John Bryson remains confident that SCE can borrow to pay out remaining debts SCE Chairman and CEO Stephen Frank expressed confidence that a final agreement could be reached before the end of the year although the California Legislature reportedly has agreed to expedite its own review of the agreement and provide approval before summer temperatures begin to wrea k havoc on the California market If for any reason the sale of the transmission assets has not been completed within two years SCE is obligat ed to sell to the state its hydroelectric generation facilities instead at a tobedetermined price Although the deal is expected to proceed some concerns have been raised about federal issues related to interstate commerce In addition the fact that Pacific Gas Electric Cowith whi ch SCE has often been intertwinedremains in bankruptcy court could also complicate the agreement between SCE and the state News of the agreement immediately caused Edison shares to increase by about or percent to on April As of the close of trading on April Edison shares were priced at about For its part SCE said that it was racing toward an agreement with the governor to avoid being forced into an involuntary bankruptcy Yet for som e time SCE has been more willing to sell its transmission assets than PGOeve r appeared to be In fact I wrote in the IssueAlert that Gov Davis had reached an agreement in principle with SCE regarding the sale of the transmission lines Most of the key elements of the agreement that has been agreed to by both parties have been in the works for over two months PGOCorp issued a statement that it was pleased that SCE had been able to reach an agreement with Gov Davis but said that the agreement did not change its own direction toward bankruptcy court According to a report on CBSMarketWatchcom Fitch analysts have suggested that the sale of SCEs transmission assets to the state of California could in fact lend a framework that might be used in Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy proceedings What this might mean is that Federal Judge Dennis Montali the official overseeing Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy might rely upo n the agreement between SCE and the State of California to mandate a similar deal for PGE Gov Davis commented that the SCE deal could serve as a bas is for separate agreements with SDGE and eventually PGE if they choose to come back to the negotiating table In fact the state could submit a plan to Judge Montali outlining a purchase of PGEs transmission assets which the judge could ultimately enforce An argument could be made that the agreement SCE has reached with the State of the California provides benefits to the utility that go beyond protectin g it from bankruptcy One could argue that SCE benefits by being able to exit the transmission business altogether which in many ways can cause tremendo us problems for the companies that choose to remain in this business Transmission operations also typically offer a low rate of return in SCEs case according to its most recent K filing its transmission business resulted in a return on equity of percent SCE had proposed that the return on equity for its transmission assets be set at percent which FERC rejected FERC has ultimate authority over transmission service pricing Thus the question could be raised of why SCE would even want to remain in the transmission business given this low return on equity Behin d the scenes SCE could very well have previously made the determination that its transmission business was not a valuable part of its overall operation This could be representative of an international trend as regulatory agencies in Australia and Great Britain have also set lower limits on the average transmission network charges that utilities can implement Moreover the State of California does not bring extensive operational expertise to its new role as a transmission owner Thus the state is wise to keep SCE employees in charge of the operation and maintenance of the transmission system This substantially reduces the risk for the state whi ch is a prudent move From the states perspective it gets an asset in exchan ge for a bailout which makes its investment in SCE beneficial However the transmission business will present unique challenges for the state such as raising capital for transmission improvements and siting procedures The state may quickly learn why the transmission business is perceived as being so challenging and why it is difficult to entice companies to build new transmission lines especially considering the low rate of return that the transmission business offers On the other hand by assuming the role of a transmission system owner the State of California will be in a position to obtain competitive information about the activities of power generators in the state This could result in a significant advantage for the State of California if it remains in its current powerbuying role An archive list of previous

to discuss how SCIENTECH can help you in todays rapidly changing marketplace IMAGE IMAGE June Update on Texas Deregulation Myriad of Issues Converge as Pilot Kicks Off By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEThe City of Dallas has become another of Texas major customers to take advantage of the savings available in the states emerging competitive electric market The city has signed an electricity contract with AES NewEnergy Under the terms of the contract AES NewEnergy will provide electricity to approximately service accounts located at municipal sites throughout the city that are currently served by TXU Electric The city of Dallas one of the nations largest cities has a population of more than million people Analysis The date at which Texas customers will begin to receive power from new suppliers under the states electric pilot program has been pushed back to midJuly but today marks the start of when new suppliers begin turning in their bid forecasts to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT Full electric competition begins in Texas on Jan Thus its a good time to do an assessment of the many interesting dynamics that have emerged in the Lone Star State some of which might pose unique challenges to the states electric market As Texas continues to prepare for full competition its electric pilot program is getting off to a rather slow start at least on the residential side an ongoing debate about incorporating Texas into the national transmission grid continues and ERCOT defends itself against claims that the state should be closely watched this summer At the same time Pat Wood the states highestranking utility regulator marks his departure from Texas to assume a position with FERC In previous columns Ive established the main points of Texas restructuring plan see IssueAlert at wwwscientechcomrcifor a review As incumbent utilities in Texas are allowed to create unregulated energy providers that can compete outside their traditional service territory an interesting game of musical chairs is taking place among the various incumbent competitors For instance Dallasbased TXU is positioning itself to hold on to its North Texas customers while expanding into Houston while Houstonbased Reliant attempts to retain its base in Houston while moving into Dallas At the same time new competitors AES NewEnergy among them have moved into the state attempting to get a jumpstart on securing customers during this pilot phase At last count regional electric providers have registered with the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT to provide power to Texas customers Also worth noting is the fact that after much speculation I recently confirmed that AEP has indeed registered as a retail electric provider REP in Texas under the name Mutual Energy representing approximately one million customers First lets look at the electric pilot program After issuing a recent delay in the start date for the pilot originally slated for June to ensure that computer systems were running effectively those Texas customers participating in the pilot should start receiving power from new providers in midJuly State officials had high hopes that most of the percent of the states electric customers eligible to participate in the pilot would select a new electric provider However at last count fewer than percent of the residential customers that are eligible have signed up since enrollment in the pilot began Feb this represents about percent of TXUs residential customers and percent of those currently served by Reliant The pilot officially ends when full competition begins Fears arising from the national coverage of the California situation appear to be dissuading Texas residential customers from participating along with general apathy about electric service Also at play is a percent discount that residential and small business customers receive from their incumbent utilities which may lower the incentive for these customers to seek out a new provider While Texas residential customers appear hesitant or apathetic about electric competition the states large industrial and commercial customers are eagerly embracing the opportunity to sign on with a new electric provider There are about large electric users in the state defined as those businesses that consume more than MW of power at peak usage Ccustomers have filled up many of the slots available in the pilot program for their customer classes and naturally appear to be generating the most competition in the state Within this space AES NewEnergy is gaining momentum In addition to its contract with the city of Dallas NewEnergy also secured a deal with HEB one of Texas leading retail companies with stores in the state AES NewEnergy is a subsidiary of AES Corp NYSE AES which controls more than MW in countries Formed in AES NewEnergy claims to be present in very state where a competitive energy market is emerging I spoke with representatives from the city of Dallas regarding their selection of AES NewEnergy among other providers including those based in Texas Interestingly NewEnergy was the only REP that responded to the citys bid Another large deal was recently announced between Cinemark USA which operates movie theaters around the state and TXU Under the contract TXU will provide energy services to Cinemark theaters outside of its traditional North Texas service territory Unlike the city of Dallas which only received a bid from one REP comparative price was a factor in Cinemarks selection of TXU Whether or not Texas should be forced to join the nations transmission grid is a debate that has been heating up over the last few weeks Ironically although President Bush usually supports free market forces he reportedly is considering a mandate that would force ERCOT into becoming interconnected with the nations two other transmission grids the Western Interconnection and the Eastern Interconnection Presently ERCOT stands independent from the other two grids and wants to keep it that way However because Texas is generally thought to have excess power it is now being considered that the Lone Star State should be made to export some of that supply to powerstarved California Presently this is not possible due to the fact that ERCOT has limited interconnections to surrounding power pools This is not the first time that this issue has been tossed around While President Bush was still governor of the state the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT studied the option of linking Texas to the other grids and found that it would be cheaper for the state to remain disconnected However as the issue of FERCs oversight over regional transmission organizations gains momentum the Bush administration may overrule Texas current sovereignty over its transmission system Further the debate on this issue is related to the policy of eminent domain in the Bush administrations energy plan which would give FERC the power to buy state property for the construction of interstate transmission lines However the question of just how much excess generation Texas might have to give to California has come into question over the last several weeks The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC sparked the controversy recently when it issued a report identifying a number of areas in the United States that should be watched closely this summer due to supply concerns In the same report NERC also mentioned that Texas should be watched closely but out of concern about the states pilot program rather than supply deficiencies ERCOT immediately disputed NERCs claim reiterating the states oftrepeated contention that it is more than prepared for competition and in fact has a percent reserve power margin In addition Texas officials point to the fact that since new plants have started operations in the state generating MW By the time competition begins fully in January more plants and MW are scheduled to come online Nevertheless in response NERC stood behind its assessment which it based on two possible ramifications of the summers pilot NERC is concerned that as Texas consolidates control areas into one and percent of the states utility customers switch to new providers as is hoped by the state this could take a toll on transmission capability Another challenge facing Texas is the shrinkage of its regulatory commission As noted Pat Wood has now officially left his post as chairman of the PUCT to become a FERC commissioner Woods departure leaves only Brett Perlman as the sole PUCT commissioner something that concerns many stakeholders as a number of final decisions on rules that will govern Texas electric market are still pending Texas Gov Rick Perry has made no announcement as to when Wood might be replaced on the PUCT along with Judy Walsh who left the commission last January Moreover the fact that the states pilot program has not attracted a large number of residential customers is not surprising Texas may not have a strong competitive residential market for some time considering the percent discount for residential and small business customers that was included in the states restructuring plan Rather the competitive Cmarket which is where the largest savings can be obtained anyway may be the true test of the success of Texas competitive market This determining factor along with the states ability to retain a strong power supply ultimately will decide the fate of Texas electric industry Because the vast majority of the new generation in Texas is fueled by natural gas there are also some related concerns about competitors being able to beat the fixed rates of utility REPs if naturalgas prices remain high However despite these factors Texas is clearly gearing up for competition and pursuing deregulation in its own independent fashion The eyes of the energy industry remain fixed on Texas as the statewhich by the way will reportedly soon become the largest state in terms of megawatts generatedcontinues its attempts to distance itself from the national debate that has somewhat tainted electric deregulation

Source According to a new report from Energy Info Source the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has begun to articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations RTOs With several approvals a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO application FERC is shaping RTO participation among investorowned utilities Analysis The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO applications based on decisions that the commission has made up to this point According to Energy Info Source FERC has concentrated its efforts on the Southeast and Western regions Within the Southeast FERC has essentially rejected Southern Companys SeTrans Gridco while conditionally approving GridSouth and Grid Florida In the West the RTO West applicationwhich represents an alliance among nine utilitiesappears to have received FERCs favor and is the preeminent leader among nonISO RTO participation efforts However despite these established trends FERC still remains at odds with many of the leading transmission owners in the nation which foresee a potential conflict between the commissions rulemaking on transmission rates and its potential impact on retail rates which are regulated by individual states For background an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission systems within a particular region The origins of FERCs RTO policy dates back to its December Order in which it strongly encouraged all transmissionowning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO by Oct with actual membership established by December of this year FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received and its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members of the commission hold Over the last year or two FERC has engaged in an ongoing debate between its preference for transco forprofit models for RTOs as opposed to independent system operators nonprofit Chairman Curt Heacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model while other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs However moving forward it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate including the limit of one entity per region As noted FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the Southeast and Western regions In addition to the obvious need to establish stability in the West another explanation for the commissions dual focus is that other regions in the United States namely the Midwest and the Northeast already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO FERC may be focusing on the West and Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established an acceptable level of market independence The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending before FERC The RTO West which FERC has referred to as the anchor of the region has been generally accepted as a broad concept RTO West includes nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest Avista Bonneville Power Administration BPA Idaho Power Montana Power PacifiCorp Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy and the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power BPA is by far the largest of the RTO West members controlling about percent of the transmission system in the region For the most part RTO West is an ISO although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella The second western RTO is Desert Star which includes utilities that are located in Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas The third proposed RTO for the Western region is the California ISO which has been operational since April and wishes to remain a standalone entity FERCs main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its desire for one RTO in the area instead of three The primary rationale for this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be more easily managed than multiple entities In addition gaming by power generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs which would require additional market rules to control the gaming FERCs general approach has been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed The California ISO has tweaked the commissions patience in particular as this solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join other entities The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps in California whenever reserves fall below percent This has been something that the state has long requested but the price caps come with the condition that California must file an application by June to enter into an RTO with other Western states Otherwise the price caps will be lifted California is currently contesting this condition Under the leadership of Chairman Heacutebert it is clearly FERCs goal to establish only one RTO for the entire Western region which puts the federal agency at odds with the California government once again The Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares Heacuteberts belief that one regional RTO is the best strategy for the West but also has said that proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the new organization up and running Other western governors have stood in unity that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being Across the country there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the Southeast For instance Chairman Heacuteberts preference for minimal RTOs within one region appears to be a national viewpoint Yet there are unique questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in the West The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida RTOwhich includes Florida Power Light Florida Power Corp and Tampa Electricand GridSouth RTO which includes Progress Energy Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas However FERC rejected Southern Companys SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies other than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy The commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo but told Southern Company not to reapply and to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO In addition FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over control of their generation assets The rejection and conditional approval from FERC which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth have been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in the region should join the alreadyapproved entities In fact FERC reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority Santee Cooper and SeTrans GridCo so that they might also join Some reports indicate that because the Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model such as the one in California FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with its own longterm goals which include a single RTO for the area Nevertheless despite receiving approval from FERC GridSouth is taking issue with two aspects of the commissions approval First GridSouth questions FERCs jurisdiction over bundled retail service and specifically wants the commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled transmission rates GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates including the charge for transmission service under FERC jurisdiction which would allow the commission to change the rates in the future FERCs Order which essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States clearly states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would agree to GridSouths interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled transmission rates Despite these isolated disputes the formation of RTOs across the United States appears to be coming together While the industry awaits for further FERC action on pending RTO applications it is clear that certain trends are emerging FERCs longstanding preference for the transco model over the ISO model appears to be diminishing as evidenced by the commissions approval of RTO West and apparent support of nonprofit operations such as the New York ISO and the Midwest ISO Rather FERC has demonstrated a more primary preference for solitary RTO entities within a region regardless of whether the entity operates as a transco or an ISO From a philosophical perspective establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple entities Further a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain intertie problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region However it will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in independent RTOs such as California to relinquish their autonomy and join forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding the operation of a transmission system An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is

Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis IMAGEOwners of transmission systems across Alabama Florida Georgia Mississippi and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding MOU to develop a regional transmission organization RTO f or the Southeast A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end of this article Two of the largest members of this new organization are Southern Company NYSE SO and Santee Cooper If the transmission owners prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity the RTO would be one of the nations largest covering more than miles o f transmission with an investment in assets in excess of billion Analysis The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern Company However the development of this muchanticipated RTO illustrates how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating answers questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives a nd raises speculation about possible impact on the regions alreadyestablishe d RTO GridSouth Further as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the country much of the commissions focus has been placed on the Southeastern United States along with the West The Southeast is dominated by large IO Us that control massive transmission assets Thus seeing that Southeastern transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for FERC You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo rm its own RTO the organization that will manage a transmission network withi n a particular region FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth er than the RTO operator which violated FERC policy In addition it is FERC s general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country and the commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous if it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity Thus FERC unequivocally told Southern Company to not reapply for RTO status until it had explored joining forces with neighboring companies Simultaneously FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth an RTO formed by Carolina Power Light Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric Gas SCANA Southern Companys neighbors to the north The conditional approva l came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the SeTrans Gridco Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority TVA about joining GridSouth Again FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to see a single large RTO serving the entire Southeast region Nevertheless now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit h seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate entity from GridSouth I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what impact if any the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on GridSouth However as of press time representatives for GridSouth had not prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity I spoke with John Sell a Southern Company spokesperson on June Sell informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with GridSouth upon FERCs directive but determined that GridSouth was too far down the road in terms of its development and that Southern Company plann ed on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets For instance while both entities are forprofit operations the new Southeast RTO plans to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Further althoug h the term Southeast RTO is being used in the press release Sell told me that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as SeTrans the name of Southern Companys rejected entity Sell stressed tha t the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern has majority power over the RTO In fact the name will be changed to something else later this year On a related note one statement that I found particularly interesting in t he press release about the new RTO is that the companies have also made it clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi on owner but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which they will operate and make decisions This is clearly a veiled reference t o Southern Company which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in its original RTO filing When I spoke with John Sell he volunteered that Southern is not the driver behind this RTO Santee Coopers involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha t precarious fashion As noted FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w ay to incorporate Santee Cooper a stateowned utility located in South Carolina into its RTO As Santee Cooper controls about miles of transmission lines covering percent of South Carolina it is no wonder that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was conjoined in some way to developing RTOs There was just one problem with this plan the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from joining forprofit enterprises The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi c power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations to join RTOs New reports indicate that if the SeTrans RTO is approved by FERC it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power entity However it is important to note that Desert Star an RTO based in Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states includes the Western Area Power Administration WAPA which owns about onethird of the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to of of the states municipal electric systems Naturally as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a forprofit entity th e question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a member given the South Carolina law I spoke with Stephen Pelcher associat e general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper about this conundrum There is an important distinction that should be understood GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents Caroli na Power Light Duke and SCANA The obstacle facing Santee Coopers participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder in a private corporation Under the SeTrans RTO in which Santee Cooper is now a participant none of the participating companies will have ownership over t he transmission entity As noted this was one of Southern Companys main interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an independent third party to oversee its operations Pelcher told me that the SeTrans RTO is still in a preliminary stage and thus it appears at this time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe nt third party Interestingly Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper and b y extension the SeTrans RTO remains in consultation with GridSouth for a coordination and implementation service agreement that would in some way interconnect the two entities One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems Specifically FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o ne RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO s could become speed bumps in the flow of electricity In fact the commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy related to these seam issues Part of the reason that Southern Companys original independent RTO plan was rejected was FERCs concern that the utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive interconnected system in the region At this point it appears that FERC favors standardization in h ow adjacent RTOs will relate to each other and thus has instructed developing RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements FERC reportedly is planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this year Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether or not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist Thus as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow it will need to determine how i t will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida and any other adjacent RTOs In addition Southern Companys John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement At this point TVA has made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and in fact as a federal agency is under no obligation to join an RTO The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for the commissions deadline of being formed by Dec of this year If the SeTrans RTO or whatever it is ultimately called gains FERCs approval it will represent a significant part of the Southeasts development into a functionally competitive electric market If FERCs stated policy of consolidating RTOs is effectively applied ultimately we could see that GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO which now includes Southern Company Santee Cooper and through a seam agreement TVA Moreover the development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of conjoining companies that transcend federal state and municipal levels
