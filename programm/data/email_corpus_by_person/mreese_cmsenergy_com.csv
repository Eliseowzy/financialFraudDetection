Colwell Sheri Battle cc Subject Fw The Pickle Jar Original Message From To Sent Monday April AM Subject The Pickle Jar THE PICKLE JAR The pickle jar as far back as I can remember sat on the floor beside the dresser in my parents bedroom When he got ready for bed Dad would empty his pockets and toss his coins into the jar As a small boy I was always fascinated at the sounds the coins made as they were dropped into the jar They landed with a merry jingle when the jar was almost empty Then the tones gradually muted to a dull thud as the jar was filled I used to squat on the floor in front of the jar and admire the copper and silver circles that glinted like a pirates treasure when the sun poured through the bedroom window When the jar was filled Dad would sit at the kitchen table and roll the coins before taking them to the bank Taking the coins to the bank was always a big production Stacked neatly in a small cardboard box the coins were placed between Dad and me on the seat of his old truck Each time as we drove to the bank Dad would look at me hopefully Those coins are going to keep you out of the textile mill son Youre going to do better than me This old mill towns not going to hold you back Also each time as he slid the box of rolled coins across the counter at the bank toward the cashier he would grin proudly These are for my sons college fund Hell never work at the mill all his life like me We would always celebrate each deposit by stopping for an ice cream cone I always got chocolate Dad always got vanilla When the clerk at the ice cream parlor handed Dad his change he would show me the few coins nestled in his palm When we get home well start filling the jar again He always let me drop the first coins into the empty jar As they rattled around with a brief happy jingle we grinned at each other Youll get to college on pennies nickels dimes and quarters he said But youll get there Ill see to that The years passed and I finished college and took a job in another town Once while visiting my parents I used the phone in their bedroom and noticed that the pickle jar was gone It had served its purpose and had been removed A lump rose in my throat as I stared at the spot beside the dresser where the jar had always stood My dad was a man of few words and never lectured me on the values of determination perseverance and faith The pickle jar had taught me all these virtues far more eloquently than the most flowery of words could have done When I married I told my wife Susan about the significant part the lowly pickle jar had played in my life as a boy In my mind it defined more than anything else how much my dad had loved me No matter how rough things got at home Dad continued to doggedly drop his coins into the jar Even the summer when Dad got laid off from the mill and Mama had to serve dried beans several times a week not a single dime was taken from the jar To the contrary as Dad looked across the table at me pouring catsup over my beans to make them more palatable he became more determined than ever to make a way out for me When you finish college Son he told me his eyes glistening Youll never have to eat beans againunless you want to The first Christmas after our daughter Jessica was born we spent the holiday with my parents After dinner Mom and Dad sat next to each other on the sofa taking turns cuddling their first grandchild Jessica began to whimper softly and Susan took her from Dads arms She probably needs to be changed she said carrying the baby into my parents bedroom to diaper her When Susan came back into the living room there was a strange mist in her eyes She handed Jessica back to Dad before taking my hand and leading me into the room Look she said softly her eyes directing me to a spot on the floor beside the dresser To my amazement there as if it had never been removed stood the old pickle jar the bottom already covered with coins I walked over to the pickle jar dug down into my pocket and pulled out a fistful of coins With a gamut of emotions choking me I dropped the coins into the jar I looked up and saw that Dad carrying Jessica had slipped quietly into the room Our eyes locked and I knew he was feeling the same emotions I felt Neither one of us could speak Sometimes we are so busy adding up our troubles that we forget to count our blessings Sorrow looks back Worry looks around Faith looks Up This is a heartwarming story of a different way of lifea time when people didnt throw away money on foolish unnecessary things it was a time when children didnt expect the world handed to them on a silver platter when people were grateful for the small more important things in life

Ponder To PJ Laughlin paige garmon Abby Ponder Kara Lee Ford Sandi McRae Sent Wednesday September PM Subject Fw WHERE WAS GOD A wonderful perspective Subject WHERE WAS GOD WHERE WAS GOD A letter was sent to me with some of the statements listed below I Added many of my own statements as I have been asked the same question Even my sons and husband questioned If there really is a GOD how could he allow this to happen Where was HE I know that the shock of what happened caused the doubt at that moment but I still feel the need to answer Ive been thinking about my response to this question and answered it with some of the statements below I decided to put it down in writing How many of us have heard that question Where was your GOD when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was attacked Well I know where my GOD was the morning of September and He was very busy He was trying to discourage anyone from taking these flights Those four flights together held over passengers and there were only aboard He was on commercial flights giving terrified passengers the ability to stay calm Not one of the family members who were called by a loved one on one of the highjacked planes said that passengers were screaming in the background On one of the flights he was giving strength to passengers to try to overtake the hijackers He was busy trying to create obstacles for employees at the World Trade Center After all only around were at the towers when the first jet hit Since the buildings held over workers this was a Miracle in itself How many of the people who were employed at the World Trade Center told the media that they were late for work or they had traffic delays He was holding up two story buildings so that of the workers Could get out I was so amazed that the top of the towers didnt topple when the jets impacted And when they did fall they fell inward GOD didnt allow them to topple over as many more lives would have been lost And when the buildings went down my GOD picked up almost of his children and carried them home with him Reassuring his frightened children that the worst was over and the best was yet to come He sat down and cried that of his children could have so much hate in their hearts That they didnt choose him but another god that doesnt exist and now they are lost forever He sent his children that are best trained for this disaster and had them save the few that were still alive but unable to help themselves And then sent many others to help in any way they were needed He still wasnt finished though He held the loved ones that were left behind in his arms He comforts them daily His other children are given the strength to reach out to them and help them in any way they can And I believe he will continue to help us with what is to come He will give the people in charge of this great nation the strength and the wisdom to do the right thing He would never leave us in our time of need So when anyone asks Where was your GOD on September you can say everywhere And yes although this is without a doubt the worst thing I have seen in my life I see GODs miracles in every bit of it I keep praying for those who dont believe in GOD every chance I have I cant imagine going through such a difficult time and not believing in GOD Life would be hopeless Author Unknown BoundaryIDwGqeCskITphWVsNVyNg Contenttype texthtml charsetiso
