on surplus reserve requirements to one of highly volatile prices and robust generation margin spikes As this shift has occurred the industry has had to adopt many of the risk management practices employed in other commodity industries For the most part these risk management practices have their genesis in the financial markets where sophisticated tools have also been developed to measure the success of these practices The most commonly recognized measure of profit exposure to unforeseen events has been Value at Risk VAR This Wall Street metric measures the statistically supported loss exposure of a portfolio of assets and forward positions to a shortterm negative turn of events While this is a very useful measure of a speculative trading portfolio its value does not translate easily to measuring exposure of generation assets to profit erosion Savvy power companies are deploying an additional risk metric Profit at Risk to more accurately assess risks specific to the volatile electricity trading market A key feature of PAR is that unlike VAR it assumes that positions will be taken through to delivery rather than closed out The full financial risk of highly volatile spot prices and volume risks including unplanned outages sudden increases in demand and delivery failures by contract partners is comprehended in this metric A blend of VAR and PAR risk metrics will create links between the front middle and back office trading operations allowing traders to operate within established risk parameters that both protect the enterprise and maximize trading profits The Austin Group Energy LP has been recognized as one of the fastest growing companies in Houston as denoted by the Houston Business Journal Top List We placed and were the highest
