<11490791.1075840331185.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,navellier@investorplace.com,2002-01-21 15:34:05,Is Cisco the Next EnronPST Dear Investor Did you check out the January st cover story of BusinessWeek If not its a MUSTREAD for any investor in this age of misinformation You see the Enron debacle is just the tip of the iceberg waiting to tear a huge hole in your retirement dreams Thats because super aggressive accounting techniques even when strictly speaking not illegal have in many cases drastically overstated how well certain companies have really done And particularly now in a tough economic test that most businesses are failing the temptation to use SMOKEANDMIRROR accounting is stronger than ever before THATS WHY YOU must be very very fussy about the stocks you own today And in just a moment Ill introduce you to my timetested strategy that identifies the true EARNINGS MONSTERS with laserlike focusand helps you avoid all the earnings dogs Enron after all was a huge disaster one with many legal issues still to be decided But there are many more earnings traps set to snare unwary investors TAKE CISCO for example The BusinessWeek article quotes Michael Porter of Harvard Business School as saying We will likely find that even during its so called heyday Cisco wasnt nearly as profitableas many believed Today Cisco CEO John Chambers is still saying I believe the best years are in front of us But thats a bet I wouldnt make Cisco isnt going to disappear like Enron But with analysts beginning to take a harder look at REAL EARNINGS its very doubtful that Cisco can grow fast enough to justify its huge market cap And once traders take an ax to the stock you could lose virtually overnight FRANKLY I had concerns about Ciscos future two years ago Thats why I told clients of my Blue Chip Growth advisory to sell and lock in our gains And since we sold the stock has already dropped Of course Cisco isnt the only highflyer we dumped before Wall Street caught on to the growing earnings problem We dumped EMC in the year and pocketed gains We BANKED GAINS from Home Depot in Amgen in WalMart in Vodafone Airtouch and in Nokia in Lucent We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS MONSTERS and sold them before they collapsed Thats why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip Growth Its simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR PROFITS in any kind of market AS YOULL SEE we dont own companies that might do okay when the economy recovers We only own companies that are EARNINGS MONSTERS right now Our Forest Labs recently hit its alltime high Since then it has pulled back slightly but this generic drugmaker has RISEN since late March Thats just what the doctor ordered Ive been pounding the table about Peoplesoft for months now Its up a STUNNING since October Thats the kind of big SHORTTERM profits I love best Conservative General Mills is a fantastic cornerstone stock today Why GREAT EARNINGS On December th the day after reporting earnings this stock closed UP in months time Retailer Lowes is one great example of the stocks we own at Blue Chip Growth No razzledazzle Just strong earnings growth The stock POPPED in Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in times like these Its a topplayer in a virtually recessionproof business Were up more than so far What manufacturing recession Chopper king Harley Davidson is hogging all the profits The company named company of the year by Forbes magazine announced charttopping earnings afterthebell on October th and its stock is UP since If you like HOME RUNS our stock in Emulex has SOARED over since the beginning of October Why Because its one of very few tech stocks thats still an EARNINGS MONSTER We own all these stocks and some twenty more like them at Blue Chip Growth And those are the sort of profits YOURE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory And this isnt some shortterm success story Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late our portfolio has beaten the SP better than to And the advisory I started in the mids MPT Review has GAINED in the last sixteen years according to The Hulbert Financial Digest WHY Because Im a very demanding guy When a company slips no matter how great it has been I dump it So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now FIND OUT by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK FREE Youll make money or it wont cost you a dime Ill give you six months to try the service riskfree set the bar as high as you want Sign up now Ill introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that are your best bet

all the tourists that it was safe to go back into the water He had dollarsigns where his heart should have been Lying for the sake of money Pushing more people right into the jaws of the Great White Shark Today a very similar thing is happening now on Wall Street And if you listen to the alliswell analysts brokers and investment advisors youre going to end up SHARKBAIT too YOU SEE everything ISNT all right Not by a long shot The economy stinks unemployment is at a decades high consumer confidence is shot and were in a nasty recession Does that sound like the right prescription for a broadbased sustainable market rally Of course not Id bet on Osama Bin Laden turning himself in before Id bet even one dollar on the market BUT and this is a very critical point just because the market is a messdoesnt mean you cant make a lot of money YOU CAN if you understand the only smart way to invest now Why are so many stocks down or more from their highs SIMPLE their earnings have sunk like rocks in the middle of the ocean And theres no sign these companies profits are coming back anytime soon The biggest PROBLEM CHILD Technology Tech companies with very few exceptions are drowning in red ink And while their stocks occasionally give you shortterm bouncesthey offer little in the way of lasting gains IF YOU WANT to stay safe now but still earn handsome profits you can take to the bank you must invest in those companies I call EARNINGS MONSTERS Thats the term I use for companies bucking the current trendand GROWING their earnings anywhere from towhile most companies are lucky to earn

so far in In fact rd quarter profits beat the street by The result The stock is UP since October st Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in times like these Its a topplayer in a virtually recessionproof business Its up a nice stomach calming YTD What recession Chopper king Harley Davidson is hogging all the profits The company announced chart topping earnings afterthebell on October th and its stock is UP since If you like HOME RUNS our stock in Emulex has SOARED since the beginning of October Why Because its one of very few tech stocks thats still an EARNINGS MONSTER We own all these stocks and some twenty more like them at Blue Chip Growth And those are the sort of profits YOURE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late our portfolio has beaten the SP better than to thanks to our commitment to earnings quality And the advisory I started years ago MPT Review has GAINED in

last year and pocketed gains We SOLD Lucent after it gained We banked gains overall from Cisco in Home Depot in Microsoft in Amgen in WalMart All stocks we SOLD last year We owned them all while they
