<27745146.1075862203822.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,cesherman@hahnlaw.com,2001-11-15 13:46:13,further report Cc now you should all have by fax the dismissals filed today in the schultes case including the gift to us of a dismissal of the contract counts against the enron entities as well i spoke with counsel for sdi who despite confidentiality restrictions confirmed my instinct that the defendants were concerned that they could be brought back in if the contract claims still existed against us i have to think harder as to whether theyre really off the hook on the tort counts but its at least reassuring they thought so interesting as well the defendants apparently urged the plaintiff to just dismiss us his lawyer apparently rejected the suggestion with the explanation that we could pay too they responded for what and apparently the plaintiffs counsel just repeated the same response if it offers any comfort sdis lawyer cant imagine any case schultes has to proceed against us on i asked why we hadnt been broached to join in and the only explanation i got which didnt seem really to be enough of an answer was that this was just part of a bigger settlement of the securities cases for our info have there been such settlements the big strategic question now is do we just wait to hear from the court or plaintiffs counsel or do we push for a hearing thoughts Charna E Sherman Hahn Loeser Parks LLP voice fax This transmission contains confidential information intended only for the addressees If you are not the intended recipient any use dissemination distribution or copying of this document or its contents is strictly prohibited
