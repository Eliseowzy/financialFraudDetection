to influence the FERC on the model for the west This follows the PR envy scenario against the RTO West group that they have been showing since mid year If this is the case we need to very carefully review their LLC and TCA agreements as well as the congestion management appendix The others are important too but these are the ones that are key Bill noted that he had issues with the PTO documents as issued and the PTOs told him that they have addressed most of his concerns Bill Dunn has been very good in helping make the documents as unbiased as the PTOs would let him but we need to be

ContentType textplain charsetISO ContentDisposition inline FYI Published Thursday May in the San Jose Mercury News Nominees for panel dont favor price caps Pair could sway vote on wholesale energy BY JIM PUZZANGHERA Mercury News Washington Bureau WASHINGTON Two Republican nominees who could tip the regulatory balance in favor of wholesale electricity price caps for California said Wednesday that they would be cautious about enacting such limits The statements by Nora Mead Brownell and Patrick Henry Wood III during their Senate confirmation hearing echoed public statements made by two other members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC regarding the price limits California officials have desperately sought to try curb soaring electricity costs Both are expected to be confirmed to fill two vacancies on the fivemember commission which regulates interstate energy sales Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Utility Commission Wood is chair of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was appointed by President Bush when he was governor Bush has opposed price caps saying they discourage companies from building new power plants and would make the California situation worse Two of the panels current members the chair Curt Hbert a Republican and Linda Breathitt a Democrat oppose wholesale price caps The third Robert Massey a Democrat has supported the costofservice price caps California has sought which would pay electricity providers the cost of producing the power plus a profit in the range of to percent Looser limits With the backing of Hbert and Breathitt the commission voted last month to set a plan for looser limits on electricity prices in California during Stage and Stage emergencies The state is considering whether to accept the plan which some experts say could actually make the situation worse this summer If Brownell and Wood supported the type of price caps California wants they could join Massey to push it through the commission But both told members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that they strongly support the freemarket system for electricity instead of regulation such as price caps And they said the complicated process of setting a specific costofservice price cap for each company could be a lengthy bureaucratic process A fair rate Honestly in the amount of time it would take to establish a fair rate we might have enough power plants to negate the problem Wood said Brownell and Wood expressed concern about Californias crisis and vowed to work quickly to help resolve the problems in prices for electricity and natural gas They also said they would aggressively pursue inquiries into allegations of price gouging by electricity providers We need to end the uncertainty and the tragedy that is occurring for all the constituents of California and the West Brownell said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif told Brownell and Wood that they were the two most important nominees to the Bush administration for California You can make the difference between life and death she said California effectively stands at a precipice No explanation Feinstein questioned the two about the huge price increases in electricity and natural gas in California but Brownell and Wood said that without detailed information they could not explain the increases But they admitted that the large increases raise concerns The math doesnt add up Wood said when questioned as to why natural gas in California has cost more than three times what it costs across the states border Despite their hesitancy on setting price caps Feinstein said she was optimistic that they might be helpful to her press for the limits She met with both for about an hour privately last month Although Senate rules prevent asking questions about specific policy positions Feinstein said Brownell and Wood showed flexibility and an understanding of the complicated California situation
