street is Baldwin This is it Restaurant is on the corner on the right This Is It is where its at for soul food By KATHI MOSBACHER Houston Chronicle Published May IN when Frank and Mattie Jones were shown the little house at Andrews in the heart of the Fourth Ward Mattie knew the search was over This is it she said They knocked down walls converted the garage into a kitchen and started a business that has become an institution This Is It soul food at its best as it says on the takeout menu The couple remained at that location until when they moved to W Gray After years there Frank Jones grandson Craig Joseph and his wife Georgette moved the restaurant to its present location at W Gray last spring Mattie died last year but yearold Frank is still cooking from in the evening until the next morning virtually the same menu he has cooked for years with the assistance now of either Gladys Jackson or Craig Joseph Craig a yearold firefighter says he and his yearold wife got involved in the restaurant because he couldnt bear to see his grandparents business sold to a stranger When hes not fighting fires a job he says he still loves after years and is able to do because of his grandfathers presence at the restaurant he joins Georgette at This Is It Georgette who pretty much runs the show also gets credit for the new locations attractive decor and of course for her renowned peach cobbler she says they made BB King his own little cobbler when he was in town recently to play at Rockefellers She firmly believes that we have the best soul food in Houston Its kind of rare to find a place where you can get a plate of food without having to worry about adding more salt or pepper Its just perfect The secret to our success is how we season our food says Craig whose grandfather takes seasoning so seriously that he insists that he or Craig do it themselves Theyre right The food is wellseasoned when its meant to be seasoned during the cooking process not at the table This is homemade soul food to make any Southerners heart sing Go helpless with hunger before making the trip the portions are huge and youll want to eat every bite Georgette says most people say theyd prefer a nap to going back to work after tucking in to three generous slabs of what may be the best meat loaf in town available Mondays Thursdays and Saturdays Fresh chopped garlic brings out the flavor in the beef Craig believes and the tomato sauce is especially good although he prefers the creamy falloffthebonetender turkey wings a special on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays Georgettes favorite dish is BBQ Rib Ends meaty chunks of pork with the brisket end of the rib barely attached to the bone full of flavor and cooked until theyve absorbed the sweethot barbecue sauce Fortunately this dish is available every day because its terrific But my favorite dish is the one Craig believes made This Is It the oxtails which Georgette says shed never even heard of before she met Craig Actually they are sliced beef tails browned then braised to deeply delicious perfection with lots of chopped onions garlic bell pepper and celery I guarantee that if I let you try them youre going to want oxtails Theyre on the steam table in the same place every day Craig says Frank Jones says the restaurant runs through about pounds of oxtails a day When we opened in I used to slice them myself and sold them for cents a plate he says Theyre now and come with a choice of three vegetables and heavenly cornbread muffins I recommend a heaping plate of the oxtails with their dense rich brown gravy spooned over white rice cabbage which is seasoned with small chunks of smoky bacon and given more texture than usual by the addition of the darker coarser outer leaves and maybe the green beans cooked according to wellfounded Southern tradition not al dente Of course you could play it safe and go with the buttery goldencrusted baked chicken or the classic pepper steak Tuesdays Fridays and Sundays Dessert is a must Beyond Georgettes peach cobbler is a selection of unimprovable lush moist cakes all baked on the premises This Is It offers breakfast seven days a week the only meal not served cafeteriastyle Everything is cooked to order and right on the mark from the wellseasoned grits with a little pool of butter on top to the pancakes All eggs come with a choice of grilled pork chops bacon two kinds of sausage or slices of sweet baked ham The restaurant may also be the perfect source for fried turkey available with hours notice My friends in Louisiana tell me that the tradition of frying turkeys began at summer crawfish boils rather than during the holidays using the same equipment for both tasks I recommend ordering one for your next picnic or country outing
