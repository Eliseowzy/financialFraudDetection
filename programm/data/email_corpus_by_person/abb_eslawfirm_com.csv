yesterdays lobbyist conference call and todays meeting re potential language changes on x Attached are two sets of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday That strategy generally speaking keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on Monday and is as outlined again below Comments concerns with language andor general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be A Persuade him that the California First notion as presented in this bill and elsewhere is not a good policy approach and that the bill should be killed because it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states and will lead them to retailiate it will isolate California from existing supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads it could deny CA access to new generation built in other states that could help CA it will slow CA projects in the pipeline it will undermine existing commercial arrangements that developers have with California entities from CA projects in the pipeline etc If this does not happen then B Persuade him to change the bill into something else as in carrotincentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development risks if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not disrupt existing arrangements then C Take the more extensive bulletproof language attached as C which protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained by the CEC if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements then C Take the offer to negotiate language attached as version C which was the language developed and circulated yesterday with the addition of irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is extended and if that doesnt work then D he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to adopt a protectionist

yesterdays lobbyist conference call and todays meeting re potential language changes on x Attached are two sets of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday That strategy generally speaking keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on Monday and is as outlined again below Comments concerns with language andor general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be A Persuade him that the California First notion as presented in this bill and elsewhere is not a good policy approach and that the bill should be killed because it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states and will lead them to retailiate it will isolate California from existing supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads it could deny CA access to new generation built in other states that could help CA it will slow CA projects in the pipeline it will undermine existing commercial arrangements that developers have with California entities from CA projects in the pipeline etc If this does not happen then B Persuade him to change the bill into something else as in carrotincentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development risks if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not disrupt existing arrangements then C Take the more extensive bulletproof language attached as C which protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained by the CEC if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements then C Take the offer to negotiate language attached as version C which was the language developed and circulated yesterday with the addition of irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is extended and if that doesnt work then D he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to adopt a protectionist
