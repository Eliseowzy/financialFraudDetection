purely between the interface of the gas and power trading systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas traders gas book There was one instance when a gas traders transactions were incorrectly bridged to a power traders gas book through EOL The root of this problem was with the EOL bridge not the interface mapping The procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication to IT regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book If for some reason the mapping does not occur the position will be mapped to a dummy default desk We will be alerted when positions are loaded to the dummy account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure that positions do no get lost in the system If anyone needs to further discuss the problem

setup in TAGG I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West Power out of this problem Im happy with the result from the West Power point of view I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists If someone does a gas deal and hasnt set up a new book properly and doesnt carefully track hisher position the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages Days weeks or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain I think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before not the gas desk with the misplaced trade Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of hisher position is missing These are the facts as I understand them Im sure that Stacey White Steve Nat and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information Let me know if I can be of further assistance Forwarded by Tim BeldenHOUECT on PM Monica Lande PM To Tim CT cc Fran CT Valarie CT Samantha CT Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot Tim Steve has described the problem accurately Setting up a dummy book solves the problem for us but not for Enron as a whole If no one monitors the dummy

intended Why cant a process be put in place for the initial setup of a book in TAGG Monica To Fran CT Monica CT Valarie CT Samantha CT cc Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot do you guys agree Forwarded by Tim BeldenHOUECT on PM From Steve nronXgate on PM CST To Tim CT Stacey W CT cc Beth nronXgate Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot Tim The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the interface job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results tables If mapping logic is not set up for a new book the job was defaulting the gas deals to the STPLT desk The default mapping has been changed to a dummy ZZerms book which will prevent the deals from showing up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated In reference to Beths concerns turns out this was a limitation in our production code not an IT change to production data so we should be OK on that front The longterm solution would be to remove the hardcoded logic setup table structures and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen Given our other priorities and the default logic change we will not pursue this option Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns Steve Original Message From Belden Tim Sent Wednesday February AM To White Stacey Cc Perlman Beth Nat Steve Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot thanks for the concise description of

the positions across the board The problem is that the position belongs to another book within Enpower The users have no access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower

of the audience of the email This is the intended procedure for use of the dummy account Both the East and the West load gas books into the Enpower system nightly this is not one persons responsibility but the entire groups responsibility Previously the only message we get for this load is a success that all the books went somewhere in Enpower With the installation of the new dummy account the message will now tell us if one of the books was loaded to this dummy account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not correctly mapped the position would go to the dummy account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that WAS correctly mapped the position would show up in that traders gas positions Depending on which load East or West has a book that was mapped to the dummy account will determine which group investigates with IT what whose positions are now stored in dummy As you have indicated manual processes do inevitably create errors The perfect procedure would be for the book to have complete and correct set up prior to having deals entered into it It would also be ideal if deals could not be entered into this book if setup was incomplete but because this is an interface mapping problem to Enpower the TAGG gas system does not recognize that the setup is incomplete I am not under the impression that the dummy account is a perfect fix however with the new alert it will provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped positions out of the West portfolio The only time the West would be affected by this change in the future is if a new power gas book is set up for your traders I hope I have addressed your concerns If I have not please give me a call or email me back Thanks Stacey To Stacey W CT cc Subject Re Potential Gas System Exposure does any of this impact the west anymore who is going to be alerted when positions are loaded to the dummy account whats the procedure for resolving what happens if eol dumps trades to a dummy account what happens if the person who is watching the dummy account is out sick or on vacation or leaves enron or is asleep at the wheel given the volatility of the commodities that we are trading and the fact that manual processes inevitably create errors as is evidenced by a million hit we took yesterday because one keystroke on deal entry was done incorrectly last summer i think its important to raise these issues To Tim CT cc John J nronXGate Sally CT Beth nronXgate Steve nronXGate Sheri CT Subject Re Potential Gas System

and asian options are accurate IT is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use IT is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly London trades many more swaptions and asian options than the US therefore the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them The majority of options in the US are European monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals The idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have Once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt The system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US and as new markets and new ideas such as the US becoming more and more of a financial market we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit Swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements Also it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower We have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that once implemented

Forwarded by Sally BeckHOUECT on AM Fernley Dyson AM To Richard NRON Sally CT cc Subject Enpower Just a headsup a longwinded email but please see highlighted paragraphs I find it hard to believe the scenario portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted Forwarded by Fernley DysonLONECT on James New To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James

<4774815.1075855883030.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stacey.white@enron.com,2000-12-13 02:01:00,Re Enpowerhave not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower His concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate IT is currently working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use IT is also working on correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly London trades many more swaptions and asian options than the US therefore the impact of not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them The majority of options in the US are European monthly and daily exercises and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals The idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US but other more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have Once the technology is in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt The system was originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US and as new markets and new ideas such as the US becoming more and more of a financial market we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit Swaption vols and asian options are two of these enhancements Also it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower We have in stage an option sensitivity matrix that once implemented into production I will be sure that James knows about It probably will not solve all his problems but it will give him a starting place Stacey Enron North America Corp From Sally Beck AM To Stacey W CT cc

portrayed here but stranger things have happened will keep you posted Forwarded by Fernley DysonLONECT on James New To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the

of the audience of the email This is the intended procedure for use of the dummy account Both the East and the West load gas books into the Enpower system nightly this is not one persons responsibility but the entire groups responsibility Previously the only message we get for this load is a success that all the books went somewhere in Enpower With the installation of the new dummy account the message will now tell us if one of the books was loaded to this dummy account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not correctly mapped the position would go to the dummy account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that WAS correctly mapped the position would show up in that traders gas positions Depending on which load East or West has a book that was mapped to the dummy account will determine which group investigates with IT what whose positions are now stored in dummy As you have indicated manual processes do inevitably create errors The perfect procedure would be for the book to have complete and correct set up prior to having deals entered into it It would also be ideal if deals could not be entered into this book if setup was incomplete but because this is an interface mapping problem to Enpower the TAGG gas system does not recognize that the setup is incomplete I am not under the impression that the dummy account is a perfect fix however with the new alert it will provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped positions out of the West portfolio The only time the West would be affected by this change in the future is if a new power gas book is set up for your traders I hope I have addressed your concerns If I have not please give me a call or email me back Thanks Stacey To Stacey W CT cc Subject Re Potential Gas System Exposure does any of this impact the west anymore who is going to be alerted when positions are loaded to the dummy account whats the procedure for resolving what happens if eol dumps trades to a dummy account what happens if the person who is watching the dummy account is out sick or on vacation or leaves enron or is asleep at the wheel given the volatility of the commodities that we are trading and the fact that manual processes inevitably create errors as is evidenced by a million hit we took yesterday because one keystroke on deal entry was done incorrectly last summer i think its important to raise these issues To Tim CT cc John J nronXGate Sally CT Beth nronXgate Steve nronXGate Sheri CT Subject Re Potential Gas System
