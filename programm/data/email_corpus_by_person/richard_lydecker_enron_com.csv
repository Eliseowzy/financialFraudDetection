regurgitating it that point would be that this deal didnt make a dime for Enron GE got a gift as I would see it of million from Enron and Catalytica got off scotfree The December DASH summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions to permit the following sale and repurchase of the spark spread option funding XONON development in an amount equal to the proceeds of the option sale funding the turbine prepayment at the Pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds obtaining the right of first refusal on the first five commercial FAs equipped with XONON and purchase of the turbines on an offbalance sheet basis Enhancing the value of the equity investment in Catalytica was mentioned as a strategic benefit and potential upside Turbine overpricing was not mentioned in the DASH or the RISK MATRIX When Dave added his comments to the May DASH I understood that the million cost was intended to be offset by million in turbine credits Doing an allocation of the cost seemed logically to mean allocation of the credits once they were recognised Outside of the slim chance that something blew up the allocated cost would be offset with a subsequently allocated credit ie a wash From an ENA perspective the issue is moot If the decision is to allocate a portion of the turbine overpricing to the merchant portfolio but none of the credits that clearly was not accounted for in or and certainly was not provided for in the Merchant Asset Management Plan Forwarded by Richard LydeckerCorpEnron on AM Richard Lydecker AM To Christopher F CT cc Subject Re out of interest Chris thanks for the clarification Pat did confirm with Sheila that the turbines were overpricedwhich seems to mean that Enron ended up giving GE a gift of million That seems strange It also still seems to me that the December DASH did not accurately reflect the deal Unless I missed it I did not find any reference to turbine overpricing My understanding of Daves comment on the May DASH was to account for the acceleration period between May and September and the risk that the Pastoria project would be cancelled andor the technology development fail in that period In May ENA gave up the opportunity to stick Catalytica with credits as payment for the repurchase of the SSO rather than cash if either of these events occured before September and thereby lost the optionality of the four months The May transaction did not change the economics of the deal in any other way than this acceleration If the comment was intended to allocate the turbine overpricing which was part of the original transaction I agree with you that this should have been handled at that time My concern has been that Enron retain the benefit of the credits referenced in the XTIA which apparently has occurred However the fact apparently is that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start by the turbine overpricing My framework had been that as long as Enron received the credits in some form the May transaction was a wash as far as I was concerned Dick Christopher F CT PM To Richard NRON cc Subject Re out of interest Dick Sounds as though this caught you by surprise sorry for that Your chronology seems correct This thing makes my head hurt every time it is brought up I believe the obligation was incurred Dec but not properly recognizedaccounted for until the May DASH Delaineys handwritten note was the end result of people dissecting the deals with the realization that the West Power turbines were overpriced by the MM and the Catalytica equity account did not properly account for that in Dec The turbine contract refers to a credit of MM but the gross turbine price was increased by twice that amount so that the net increase was MM ENA agreed to it because Piper wanted to help Catalytica Despite much protest from Dave Parquet I agreed with Delainey and Ray Bowen that West Power would be on the hook for MM of the MM because the project got some benefit from Catalytica Delainey wanted the payment triggered on sale of Pastoria because he did not want my group to recognize any income until the project closed This was communicated to and acknowledged by accounting and I reminded them of it every month or two since midyear I understand Pat called Sheila Tweed I dont think she or anyone remembers the details but she should be able to validate the point about turbine overpricing and the Delainey fix in May Regards Chris Richard NRON PM To Christopher F CT cc Subject Re out of interest Chris I couldnt agree more about the confusing history of the Catalytica XTIA and spark spread derivative transactions My understanding is slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources Neither of us were present at the creation I am familiar with Dave Delaineys handwritten note on the May DASH That DASH authorised accelerating repurchase of the SSO by three months My view is that Dave could allocate within ENA at his discretion I did not understand the rationale however since it was the December DASH which established the obligation for Enron to fund the million All the May DASH did was unwind a financing arrangement three months early It did not have anything to do with the incurrence of the obligation itself The objective of the complex series of agreements was for Enron to finance GEs development of the Xonon technology and in return receive credits on turbine purchases either at Pastoria or for other xononequiped turbines if Pastoria were cancelled Original Deal Catalytica agreed to purchase a spark spread option SSO from Enron for million payable in four instalments These instalments exactly matched the funding obligation to GE under the XTIA Catalytica actually paid Enron million which represented the first two instalments West LB made million milestone payments to GE The EnronWest LP arrangement was an off balance sheet financing deal At the end of the day Enron was paying GE By September Enron was obligated to repurchase the SSO from Catalytica for the amount Catalytica had paid Enron or for turbine credits if Pastoria were cancelled May SSO Repurchase Enron bought back the SSO from Catalytica for million The threemonth acceleration of repurchase was supposed to facilitate an IPO It did not impact at all Enrons ultimate obligation which had always been for the full million Catalytica was now out of the chain and had no further payment obligations or credit entitlements December Final Milestone payment to GE Enron has paid GE million through the West LB financing arrangement now Turbo Park I am uncertain whether GE increased the price of the Pastoria turbines by million as part of these transactions My understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated but I had thought this concern was to be guarded against in contract negotiation with GE If in fact GE did increase the cost of the Pastoria turbines by million the entire purpose and benefit to Enron from these incredibly complex and nonintuitive documents was totally obviated Net net Enron would have paid GE to develop a technology application with no compensatory value Why Enron would have done this kind of deal I dont know Im not sure what internal income transfer would apply I understand that GE has applied the million credit against a progress payment billing late last year Wouldnt this mean that the full credit was taken by Pastoria It is unclear to me why the sale of Pastoria should trigger anything At the end of the day ENA did the deal in and how we account for the consequences now is irrelevant If the turbines were overpriced the December DASH seems to me to be misleading in not disclosing that fact when approval was requested The DASH actually states that the million would serve as a down payment for the Pastoria turbine package My summary may not be correct but this is the best I have been able to piece together on what happened Dick Forwarded by Richard LydeckerCorpEnron on PM Louise CT PM To Richard nron cc Subject Re out of interest Forwarded by Louise KitchenHOUECT on PM Christopher F Calger PM To Louise CT cc Subject Re out of interest Calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for Pastoria was overpriced by MM the amount of the Catalytica credit A brief confusing history as I understand itENA East and West jointly owned the Catalytica equity account in It was written up based on expectations of an IPO value At it transferred to West Power because Catalytica entered into an agreement with Pastoria to provide the Project with its Zonon technology This agreement included a commitment from GE to do researchwork in order to use the Catalytica technology on GE turbines The cost of this MM was added to the Pastoria turbine contract In Feb when I arrived in Portland I had the Catalytica account transferred to the Portfolio because I thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ENA West Power In mid the agreement was restructured in order to clean up Catalytica so it could IPO At that time Enron was credited back the MM from Catalytica and it was decided by Delainey that that amount should be split Pastoria and Catalytica Equity with the going to ENA West Power upon the sale of Pastoria Pastoria did not get the full MM back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings At this time since there is no funds transfer I believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the Merchant Portfolio to ENA West Power
