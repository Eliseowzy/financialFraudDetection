Wednesday October AM To Litton Todd Hickerson Gary Durst Philip Kendall Heather Romain Danielle Subject NYT Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts October Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts By FLOYD NORRIS Enron newsquote has ample access to cash the companys chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional writeoffs stemming from unusual financing activities In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enrons stock plunged on Monday the chief executive Kenneth W Lay strongly defended the companys chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S Fastow the chief financial officer In addition Mr Fastow while declaring that Enron expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations declined to answer any questions about it The conference call which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange at first seemed to be reassuring investors Within minutes of the beginning of the call the share price rallied to But it soon began falling and ended the day down cents at The days low of was the lowest since Jan and was down percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of Until recently most investors focused on the companys reported operating earnings which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions some involving offbalance sheet financing One involving partnerships controlled by Mr Fastow led to a billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to SEC inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday One of the companys strongest supporters has been David Fleischer an analyst at Goldman Sachs But he told Mr Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information There is an appearance that you are hiding something he said After the call Mr Fleischer expressed disappointment Theyve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about and that are hard to understand he said in an interview They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them as is needed he said But he said he was still recommending the stock I dont think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans he said In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company there is tremendous value here Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr Fastow But he emphasized that both he and the companys board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy Mr Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enrons reporting in conjunction with another offbalancesheet vehicle called Marlin That company owns onethird of Azurix newsquote an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex a British water utility The auditors have determined there is no writedown required he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management a money management firm Mr Grubman said that Marlin owed almost billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake Noting that Enron had paid about million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken writedowns on its investment in Azurix Mr Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares Mr Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details Eventually he cut off Mr Grubman I know youre trying to drive the stock price down and youve done a pretty good job of it Mr Lay said But lets move on to the next question Mr Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had billion in such debt outstanding He said it was backed by billion in bank lines of credit of which billion will expire next May if it is not renewed Mr Lay said he was sorry about the misunderstanding that resulted when his brief mention of the billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report but it did not He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future but made no promises The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings and so was not in the earnings release But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement The SEC is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin Mr Lay said the company will look into providing such statements Erin Willis Financial Trading Ph Fx

Greene John Sent Friday September AM To Hickerson Gary Subject FW Very Interesting Article from The Washington Post FYI I am sure we already have enough of our own stocks on the books but this may be worth relaying to Greg et al Original Message From Towarek Michael Sent Friday September AM To Greene John Subject FW Very Interesting Article from The Washington Post Stocks to Trade Monday With Special Rule Big Firms Can Buy Shares Back to Halt Plunge By Kathleen Day and John M Berry Washington Post Staff Writers Friday September Page E In advance of the planned reopening of US stock markets on Monday major securities firms and corporations have reached an extraordinary agreement to prop up prices by buying shares if a flood of sell orders threatens to send the markets into a free fall industry and government sources said yesterday Federal securities regulators have made it clear they will permit these and other market practices that might raise legal questions in ordinary circumstances the sources said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt alluded to the informal accord yesterday when he said the agency would make it as easy as possible for companies to buy back their own shares and would open a hot line for brokers and companies with questions about proper trading practices The governments green light was signaled late yesterday after a major firm approached the SEC requesting that the rules concerning share buybacks be relaxed temporarily because of widespread fears of an investor panic in reaction to Tuesdays terrorist attacks Wall Street sources said We intend to make it easy for public corporations to repurchase their shares Pitt said at a news conference with New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard A Grasso and Nasdaq Chairman Harwick Simmons But Pitt also made it clear the agency will be making sure investors dont get gouged which securities lawyers interpreted to mean that the SEC will allow corporate buybacks only to the extent that they dont hurt investors by unfairly propping up or depressing individual company prices The SEC chief said he will announce today a number of steps to facilitate an orderly market He hinted strongly that short selling a practice in which investors bet that stock prices will fall will be restricted With respect to short selling the goal of all of us is to have a market that most closely approximates the normal trading environment he said As a result of that you can tell in which direction we will probably be leaning The plan to resume stock trading on Monday after a fourday halt the longest since the Great Depression depends on a test of market systems scheduled for Saturday the three men said Securities industry executives interviewed yesterday said the Monday target is attainable but privately voiced concern about whether it will be met warning that power outages disrupted phone service and structural damage to buildings are proving to be more daunting than expected While industry and government officials have struggled for days with the technical obstacles to reopening the US markets the largest in the world the agreement yesterday reflected their concerns about the potential psychological hurdles ahead As the market opens on Monday no one knows what will happen said an executive of a major securities firm But people have been made aware that theyre looking at facilitating the ability of companies to purchase shares if the market gets wacky Pitt would not disclose details about how stock buyback rules will be eased but SEC steps could include relaxing rules about the volume of stock that can be purchased and allowing such trades at the beginning and end of trading sessions securities industry experts said Sources said the SECs decision is similar to steps the agency took to restore stability and confidence in the aftermath of the market crash Before the SEC was created in the early s powerful Wall Street figures tried on occasion to prop up the market in times of distress JP Morgan stopped a panic in that way In October Richard Whitney an exchange official became a national hero by walking onto the jittery trading floor and placing a bold order to buy US Steel above its price at the time The move backed by a group of bankers buoyed hopes and prices but only for two days Then the market crashed Yesterday the Federal Reserve which pumped a record billion into the US banking system on Wednesday put in another billion in the afternoon to ensure that brokerage firms investment banks and other companies providing financial services have no trouble financing loans or other types of investment activity In another effort to shore up market confidence Treasury Secretary Paul H ONeill issued a statement before television cameras taking sharp issue with the concerns voiced by many private economists that the terrorist assault will tip the slowing US economy into a recession by destroying consumer confidence The destruction in New York City is horrible and detestable At the same time Americas dynamic economy is not located in any one place ONeill said Innovation and productivity are found in every factory and farm every laboratory every financial institution every small business and every home office across America That spirit cannot be destroyed Although the tragedy will cause some supply disruptions and transportation stoppages these effects will be transitory ONeill said The prospects for a rebound in the US economy later this year remain unchanged Helping to bolster optimism was the performance of markets in Europe which continued to claw their way back from the steep drops Tuesday that followed the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon Germanys DAX index rose percent and London share prices were up percent though Frances CAC index dipped slightly Japans Nikkei index eked out a gain of percent and Hong Kongs Hang Seng index rose percent But two pieces of news yesterday underscored how shaky the US economy was even before this weeks events A monthly survey of consumer sentiment dropped to an year low in the first part of this month The survey compiled by the University of Michigan provided a reading of down from the month before and by far the lowest since sentiment began falling late last year Significantly both consumers assessment of the state of the economy and their expectations about it six months from now deteriorated noticeably Analysts at the university said the early September loss was due to heightened concerns about future prospects for the national economy as well as more pessimistic assessments by consumers of their own financial situation Given the shock of the terrorist attacks the likelihood that the economic downturn could turn into a fullfledged recession has grown substantially Meanwhile the Labor Department said the number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped to last week well above the level that had been reported for several weeks A number of analysts said the increase was a sign that the labor market is continuing to deteriorate and that joblessness is certain to continue rising In the US government bond market where trading resumed yesterday after a twoday hiatus yields on some Treasury bills plummeted more than fourtenths of a percentage point Yields on sixmonth bills tumbled to percent the lowest level in decades Analysts said the sharp drop was the result of several factors including the flight to quality impulse that often materializes during crises as investors move money into US government securities which are viewed as the safest in the world Strong demand for bonds causes yields to drop as investor become more willing to hold them regardless of their yields Yields were also depressed by expectations of many investors and analysts that the Fed will cut interest rates no later than its next policymaking session on Oct That would be the eighth rate cut since the beginning of the year SEC officials did an aboutface from Wednesday when a spokesman said the agency didnt know where investors having trouble contacting brokers should go to learn about their accounts and money Pitt said that in addition to the hot line for financial institutions the agency would today open another one for investors who have questions about their accounts The numbers will be posted on the SECs Web site wwwsecgov The National Association of Securities Dealers the parent company of Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange said it will post on its Web site today wwwnasdrcom information about where investors with questions can go A Nasdaq spokesman also had to backtrack yesterday from a statement Simmons made Wednesday apparently in error that of the securities firms with offices in the World Trade Center had not been heard from The spokesman said in fact Nasdaq had heard from of the It hadnt tried to contact the other seven All have said they can be up and running at least in some capacity the spokesman said Staff writers Paul Blustein and Glenn Kessler in Washington and Carol Vinzant in New York contributed to this report

default and devaluation risk rises Bra zil feels the effects of the contagion Date July From Maureen RaymondCastaneda Gwyn Koepke We believe that the risk of an Argentine debt default has increased and pes o devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days Due to recent economic and fiscal developments in Argentina we believe Argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out of a year recession exacerbated by a global slowdown and a strong peso Argentinas fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic we akness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal deficit and pay off the countrys debt service A loss of investor confid ence has caused spreads to widen despite Argentinas need to rollover about bn of shortterm Letes Argentine government debt by the end of the yea r Yields paid at this weeks Treasury auction are at levels that are not sustainable over the mediumterm Threemonth Treasury yields are versus paid at auction on June and on June In addition to suffering from widening yields Argentina was forced to shorten the teno r of debt from a mix of month and year bonds issued previously to only month securities at this weeks auction due to increased risk aversion to longerterm government paper by local investors pension funds and banks The sharp increase in Letes yields and the inability to issue longer mat urities is highly indicative of the difficulty the Argentine government wi ll have in rolling over bn in shortterm paper over the remainder of the year at sustainable rates which further weakens its fiscal position due to higher interest payments The recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persist ently strong US dollar which has hurt Argentinas export competitiveness e specially visavis the Brazilian real that has depreciated about relat ive to the USD since the beginning of the year As a result to these facto rs we believe the risks of Argentine debt default and peso devaluation are mounting Argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system Argen tines are switching from peso to dollar deposits Argentinas limited fore x reserves constrain the central banks ability to support the peso if pri vate sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into US dollars Private sector deposits of bn are pesodenominated or bn and are f oreign currencydenominated deposits which dwarf Argentinas official fore x reserves of bn Total private sector deposits fell about bn from bn to bn between February and endApril this year before stabiliz ing at bn as of July th Political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt Economic M inister Cavallos ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal auster ity program announced late yesterday Cavallo needs to win approval for hi s fiscal agenda not only at the national level but also at the provincial level which will not be easy considering the year contraction Failure to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen Argentinas fiscal woe s and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence These external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to speculative attack and threaten the to dollar peg especially in light of the countrys limited foreign exchange reserves Today Argentinas month NDF traded at P implying risk of a devaluation while yester day the month NDF traded at P implying an increased probability of devaluation since yesterday Also today the year NDF traded at i mplying a devaluation As a result of these above internal and externa l pressures we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substant ially The danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold do llardenominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from sharply higher debt payments This could cripple an already tenuous econo mic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue thro ugh lower tax receipts Developments in Argentina impact Brazil through main channels Currency Volatility Contagion from Argentina has lead to a
