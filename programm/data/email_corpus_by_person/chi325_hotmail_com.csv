bail a friend out of jail within hours Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move a Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move a Youd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns If youve known a guy for more than hours his sister is off limits forever unless you actually marry her The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy whos running late is minutes Maximum waiting time minutes For a girl you have to wait minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic scale Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddys fridge is forbidden Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man In fact even remembering your buddys birthday is strictly optional On a road trip the strongest bladder determines pit stops not the weakest While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies girlfriends within minutes of meeting them you are not required to make nice with her gal pals significant dickheads low level sports bonding is all the law requires sorry ladies its called a double standard because its twice as true Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract do not appear in public wearing more than one swoosh When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event you may always ask the score of the game in progress but you may never ask whos playing You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought her to climax If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of flatulent entertainment shes officially your girlfriend It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when youre sunning on a tropical beachand its delivered by a topless supermodeland its free Only in situations of Moral andor Ass peril are you allowed to kick another guy in the nuts Unless youre in prison never fight naked Friends dont let friends wear Speedos Ever Issue closed If a mans zipper is

You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a girlfriends cat even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw it into a ceiling fan A man in the company of a hot suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza but not both Thats just plain mean If you complement a guy on his sixpack youd better be talking about his choice of beer Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of yours except if shes withholding sex pending your response Phrases that may not be

bathroom unless you are on equal footing both urinating both waiting in line etc For all other situations an almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are able to have sex with her Keep a stopwatch by the phone Hang up if necessary When a buddy is trying to hook up you may sabotage him only in a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a massive hangover You may however hide the aspirin smear his chair with limburger cheese turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his monitor is broken and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven minutes The morning after you and a babe who was formerly just a friend have carnal drunken
