Carolyn Baker Randy Hickok Greg Blue Kent Wheatland Jeff Dasovich Roger Pelote Susan Mara Curt Hatton Gary Ackerman CHARLES A MIESSNER Corby Gardiner Rob Nichol Curtis Kebler Rob Lamkin Carl Imparato Subject Email Glitch Have just discovered that some emails sent to the board earlier this week did not go through and got hung up in cyberspace Most dealt with the emergency petitions for modification filed by Edison and PGE and the data request for financial information which ALJ Minkin issued This is the first which went out on Monday SDGE has filed an initial response to ALJ Minkins Ruling which first requests that the utility should not be subject to the information request which stemmed from the SCE and PGE emergency petitions If the Commission is unwilling to do so the utility next informs the Commission of its intention not to respond fully to the request The crux of the opposition is as follows However neither Rule nor the Public Utilities Code require SDGE to waive certain fundamental due process rights pertaining to its discovery obligations Specifically simply because the information is requested in an ALJ ruling as opposed to alternative discovery mechanisms does not require SDGE to produce confidential proprietary competitively sensitive information belonging to its affiliates which information is neither pertinent to a transaction between SDGE and an affiliate nor in the possession of SDGE A number of the informational demands in the ALJ Ruling fall squarely within this context and therefore are not appropriate for discovery purposes The utility then states that In an effort to cooperate with the Commission and the ALJ to provide for Commission inspection relevant information reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence SDGE will provide affiliate information responsive to the ALJs informational demands to the extent that the information relates to a transaction with SDGE ie falls within the scope of PUC section b the information is public information not confidential and proprietary to the affiliate or the information is a matter of public record SDGE responses to information demands a b c d f g i k q and bb were attached to the filing and will be provided to other parties who request them I have requested a copy be sent to us Noteit has arrived Finally the utility then itemizes the following items of information which it will not provide m An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by the California PX by each utility affiliate for each month in n An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by the California ISO by each utility affiliate for each month in p An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by any entity other than the California ISO or PX for power purchased in California by each utility affiliate under the assumption that any entity includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided r An itemization of revenues received from the California PX for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and t Revenues received from the California ISO for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and v An itemization of revenues received from entities other than the California PX and the California ISO for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and under the assumption that any entity includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided x Revenues received for power purchase sales in any state other than California by each utility affiliate for each month in l and y A description of all utility affiliates activities in California electric markets including marketing scheduling selling or purchasing electricity either independently or jointly with other entities under the assumption that any entities includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided we will also provide public information related to those activities such as press releases etc since no time frame has been provided related to this information request we will respond concerning activities beginning January z A description of each energy facility purchased wholly or in part by the utility or any of its affiliates in l including its purchase price and location we will provide any public information addressing affiliate purchases as well as all information including confidential proprietary information related to a transaction with SDGE aa A description of each energy facility or portion thereof sold by the utility or any of its affiliates in l including its sale price and location we will provide any public information addressing affiliate sales as well as all information including confidential proprietary information related to a transaction with SDGE cc A copy of the most recent business plan for itself its holding company and each of its affiliates we will provide copies of those portions of affiliate or holding company business plans that discuss or describe transactions with SDGE The basis of SDGEs objection to produce the foregoing information is that the information exceeds the scope of the Commissions statutory authority to require production of affiliate information under PUC section b the information is not relevant to any proceeding currently before the Commission the information is not reasonably calculated to result in the discovery of admissible evidence in any Commission proceeding and the information is not in the possession of nor is it proprietary to SDGE After doing a comparison of the list of items for which responses are being provided with the list for which objections are raised I noted that items e h j l o s u and w are simply not mentioned I have sent an email to their counsel asking for the status of those requests Let me know if you want a copy of the SDGE filing Dan

response to them The following is a summary of the remarks o f the four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered Major features Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent nonstakeholde r boards Continued significant role for the presidents of PXISO who should be made voting members Elimination of mandated buysell requirement for the IOUs although no explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action Overreliance on spo t markets has been problematical As an independent exchange the PX will be free to design the products desired by the market The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary measure Single price for all offers below However no bid above will se t the price for all generators A seller can bid anything it wants Allowing generators to receive their asbid price will allow highcost generators to participate in the market However the generator will be required to provide confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove r through The order requires forward scheduling of of an scheduling coordinators schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exce ed As an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who comply with the tolerance band Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO The order would eliminate the ISOs price cap authority Beginning the prospect of refunds will be available Commissioner Hebert Due to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his remarks He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order but is troubled by some of its features The cap is questionable whether described as a Soft cap or as a hard cap His concern is that it will clearly discourage new investment in generatio n He therefore recommended that the cap should be escalated on a regula r basis perhaps every six months until it reaches at least He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC on These filings should address the major aspects of the Order issued today Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was disingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy Commissioner Breathitt Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the orderT he order is based on a market approach In choosing our marketbased approac h it is our goal to guide the markets to selfcorrect and not reinstitute command and control regulation We have all worked too hard too long t o have this result Commissioner Massey Sixtyfive years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and reasonable There is no exception for marketbased approaches He will concur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and unreasonable The order does insure that prices should return to being jus t and reasonable Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an month forward product designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law dictated that prices had to be just and reasonable The is a soft cap and allows a generator to bid above it but if it does it will not set the price which other generators receive He invites comments on this issue With regard to retroactive refunds the Office of the General Counsel has prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October Invites comments on this issue California needs new generation and transmission and the siting authority belongs to the state California must do its part to ensure that customers do in fact benefit from competitive markets that ensure just and reasonable prices He is not yet confident that the Commission has taken all necessary steps Chairman Hoecker He strongly supports the order Comments are due in three weeks This is no time to pull punches He cited the San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were out o f synch with the needs of the digital economy For FERC regulators who are used to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies th is was a real eyeopener Average citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had no competitive alternatives It was unfair to them and there is plenty of responsibility for this meltdown to go around If I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income or a sma ll business owner living on a small profit margin or a school administrator dealing with a tight budget the doubling of my bill would make me want my money back or to at least ensure that this wont happen again in the future Many who expected this order expected a lynching and the transfer of lar ge amounts of money They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated th e market and order the disgorgement of their illgotten gains As our legal opinion indicates thats not going to happen Todays order offer s a thoughtful way back to a rational basis for buying and selling power in th e West We are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of market power The order makes better market monitoring going forward a fundamental part of FERCs proposal If evidence of such behavior is brought forward FERC will act on that information However we cant d elay work on a market fix while searching for the culpable parties Hoecker believes that strong federal action is both warranted and important at this moment The bulk power grid must be made to work efficiently across the entire West Competition is at risk make no mistake about that In view of the California experience several states are reconsidering or shelving plans t o implement competition Legislators will want to retain the possibility of returning to the old days of verticallyintegrated utilities The California experience has been instructive but not helpfulto the meandering implementation of competition throughout the nation The states markets have not been mistakenly federalized as alleged b y some The markets are regional Californias access to interstate power supplies is critical as was made evident by recent events If we do things right California will not be a federal enclave designed to satisfy our market predilections it will be a workable and competitive market that benefits consumers This is a strong order It needs to be a strong order We expect to have a strong order in December and the public needs it A copy of these notes are attached if you need to distribute them to anyon e in your organizations November Meeting Notesdoc

<12773941.1075843068418.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,douglass@arterhadden.com,2000-12-11 05:01:00,An Editorial from Todays Electricity DailyThings Get Even Worse in California Although it hardly seems possible the California wholesale electric market is getting worse And rapidly Power prices are high across the board and the California Independent System Operator has taken to declaring simultaneous stage one and stage two emergencies every morning right along with brewing the morning coffee On Thursday afternoon the ISO declared the first stage three emergency although it was not necessary to implement rolling blackouts Demand hit MW during the day far from a peak for the state But planned and unplanned outages meant that the statewide capacity margin was a bare MW The chief culprit appears to be the states price caps which are driving generation out of the state and the politicians appear poised to make matters worse The caps combine with soaring natural gas prices to drive electricity out of the California market Because of gas prices in the per million Btu range the price caps are simply not enforceable They are in short a joke With price caps of MWh in place through the California Power Exchange and with bids hitting the caps for every hour of the market generators are fleeing the state Thats because prices in the Pacific Northwest are running in the neighborhood of MWh and generators are selling into Oregon and Washington instead of California Dow Jones reports that utilities in the Northwest last week showed up as buyers in the Cal PX buying power at MWh MWh for the juice and MWh for transportation Just how wacky has the California market become In order to protect reliability the Cal ISO has been quietly purchasing power in bilateral deals from outofstate generators at prices above the cap The price cap rules apparently allow the ISO to buy above the cap if needed to supply an emergency But it can only buy from outofstate companies not the California generators Last Wednesday the ISO paid some million to buy MW most likely from BC Hydro although the ISO isnt talking or about MWh Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sitting in the catbird seat with excess capacity sold the ISO some MW at the capped rate of MWh A civil suit charges that LADWP has been shock profiteering by selling its lowcost juice from Bonneville Power Administration into the California market at an order of magnitude above what it paid How are the states politicians responding They dont seem to understand the shortterm consequences of what is going on They are talking about banning exports of power made in California can you say Commerce Clause or forming a state power agency not in this decade or reregulating the utilities ditto There is only one action that California can take to protect itself against blackouts this winter The state must get rid of the price caps entirely Immediately Californias choice is simple and stark Does the state want to ensure that its citizens have not enough power at an artificially low price or enough power at a politically unpopular high price The need for power trumps the price issue

Carolyn Baker Randy Hickok Greg Blue Kent Wheatland Jeff Dasovich Roger Pelote Susan Mara Curt Hatton Gary Ackerman CHARLES A MIESSNER Corby Gardiner Rob Nichol Curtis Kebler Rob Lamkin Carl Imparato Subject Email Glitch Have just discovered that some emails sent to the board earlier this week did not go through and got hung up in cyberspace Most dealt with the emergency petitions for modification filed by Edison and PGE and the data request for financial information which ALJ Minkin issued This is the first which went out on Monday SDGE has filed an initial response to ALJ Minkins Ruling which first requests that the utility should not be subject to the information request which stemmed from the SCE and PGE emergency petitions If the Commission is unwilling to do so the utility next informs the Commission of its intention not to respond fully to the request The crux of the opposition is as follows However neither Rule nor the Public Utilities Code require SDGE to waive certain fundamental due process rights pertaining to its discovery obligations Specifically simply because the information is requested in an ALJ ruling as opposed to alternative discovery mechanisms does not require SDGE to produce confidential proprietary competitively sensitive information belonging to its affiliates which information is neither pertinent to a transaction between SDGE and an affiliate nor in the possession of SDGE A number of the informational demands in the ALJ Ruling fall squarely within this context and therefore are not appropriate for discovery purposes The utility then states that In an effort to cooperate with the Commission and the ALJ to provide for Commission inspection relevant information reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence SDGE will provide affiliate information responsive to the ALJs informational demands to the extent that the information relates to a transaction with SDGE ie falls within the scope of PUC section b the information is public information not confidential and proprietary to the affiliate or the information is a matter of public record SDGE responses to information demands a b c d f g i k q and bb were attached to the filing and will be provided to other parties who request them I have requested a copy be sent to us Noteit has arrived Finally the utility then itemizes the following items of information which it will not provide m An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by the California PX by each utility affiliate for each month in n An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by the California ISO by each utility affiliate for each month in p An itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by any entity other than the California ISO or PX for power purchased in California by each utility affiliate under the assumption that any entity includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided r An itemization of revenues received from the California PX for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and t Revenues received from the California ISO for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and v An itemization of revenues received from entities other than the California PX and the California ISO for power purchase sales in California by utility affiliates for each month in l and under the assumption that any entity includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided x Revenues received for power purchase sales in any state other than California by each utility affiliate for each month in l and y A description of all utility affiliates activities in California electric markets including marketing scheduling selling or purchasing electricity either independently or jointly with other entities under the assumption that any entities includes SDGE the information related to any SDGE transactions will be provided we will also provide public information related to those activities such as press releases etc since no time frame has been provided related to this information request we will respond concerning activities beginning January z A description of each energy facility purchased wholly or in part by the utility or any of its affiliates in l including its purchase price and location we will provide any public information addressing affiliate purchases as well as all information including confidential proprietary information related to a transaction with SDGE aa A description of each energy facility or portion thereof sold by the utility or any of its affiliates in l including its sale price and location we will provide any public information addressing affiliate sales as well as all information including confidential proprietary information related to a transaction with SDGE cc A copy of the most recent business plan for itself its holding company and each of its affiliates we will provide copies of those portions of affiliate or holding company business plans that discuss or describe transactions with SDGE The basis of SDGEs objection to produce the foregoing information is that the information exceeds the scope of the Commissions statutory authority to require production of affiliate information under PUC section b the information is not relevant to any proceeding currently before the Commission the information is not reasonably calculated to result in the discovery of admissible evidence in any Commission proceeding and the information is not in the possession of nor is it proprietary to SDGE After doing a comparison of the list of items for which responses are being provided with the list for which objections are raised I noted that items e h j l o s u and w are simply not mentioned I have sent an email to their counsel asking for the status of those requests Let me know if you want a copy of the SDGE filing Dan

response to them The following is a summary of the remarks o f the four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered Major features Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent nonstakeholde r boards Continued significant role for the presidents of PXISO who should be made voting members Elimination of mandated buysell requirement for the IOUs although no explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action Overreliance on spo t markets has been problematical As an independent exchange the PX will be free to design the products desired by the market The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary measure Single price for all offers below However no bid above will se t the price for all generators A seller can bid anything it wants Allowing generators to receive their asbid price will allow highcost generators to participate in the market However the generator will be required to provide confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove r through The order requires forward scheduling of of an scheduling coordinators schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exce ed As an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who comply with the tolerance band Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO The order would eliminate the ISOs price cap authority Beginning the prospect of refunds will be available Commissioner Hebert Due to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his remarks He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order but is troubled by some of its features The cap is questionable whether described as a Soft cap or as a hard cap His concern is that it will clearly discourage new investment in generatio n He therefore recommended that the cap should be escalated on a regula r basis perhaps every six months until it reaches at least He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC on These filings should address the major aspects of the Order issued today Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was disingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy Commissioner Breathitt Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the orderT he order is based on a market approach In choosing our marketbased approac h it is our goal to guide the markets to selfcorrect and not reinstitute command and control regulation We have all worked too hard too long t o have this result Commissioner Massey Sixtyfive years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and reasonable There is no exception for marketbased approaches He will concur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and unreasonable The order does insure that prices should return to being jus t and reasonable Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an month forward product designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law dictated that prices had to be just and reasonable The is a soft cap and allows a generator to bid above it but if it does it will not set the price which other generators receive He invites comments on this issue With regard to retroactive refunds the Office of the General Counsel has prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October Invites comments on this issue California needs new generation and transmission and the siting authority belongs to the state California must do its part to ensure that customers do in fact benefit from competitive markets that ensure just and reasonable prices He is not yet confident that the Commission has taken all necessary steps Chairman Hoecker He strongly supports the order Comments are due in three weeks This is no time to pull punches He cited the San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were out o f synch with the needs of the digital economy For FERC regulators who are used to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies th is was a real eyeopener Average citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had no competitive alternatives It was unfair to them and there is plenty of responsibility for this meltdown to go around If I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income or a sma ll business owner living on a small profit margin or a school administrator dealing with a tight budget the doubling of my bill would make me want my money back or to at least ensure that this wont happen again in the future Many who expected this order expected a lynching and the transfer of lar ge amounts of money They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated th e market and order the disgorgement of their illgotten gains As our legal opinion indicates thats not going to happen Todays order offer s a thoughtful way back to a rational basis for buying and selling power in th e West We are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of market power The order makes better market monitoring going forward a fundamental part of FERCs proposal If evidence of such behavior is brought forward FERC will act on that information However we cant d elay work on a market fix while searching for the culpable parties Hoecker believes that strong federal action is both warranted and important at this moment The bulk power grid must be made to work efficiently across the entire West Competition is at risk make no mistake about that In view of the California experience several states are reconsidering or shelving plans t o implement competition Legislators will want to retain the possibility of returning to the old days of verticallyintegrated utilities The California experience has been instructive but not helpfulto the meandering implementation of competition throughout the nation The states markets have not been mistakenly federalized as alleged b y some The markets are regional Californias access to interstate power supplies is critical as was made evident by recent events If we do things right California will not be a federal enclave designed to satisfy our market predilections it will be a workable and competitive market that benefits consumers This is a strong order It needs to be a strong order We expect to have a strong order in December and the public needs it A copy of these notes are attached if you need to distribute them to anyon e in your organizations November Meeting Notesdoc
