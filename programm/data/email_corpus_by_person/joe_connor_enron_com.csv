agree too quickly THEY ARE SAYING THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO A FORPROFIT ARRANGEMENT THEY SEEM TO BE IGNORING THAT THE PRPOSAL SAYS A TRANSMISSION OWNER CAN KEEP THEIR ASSETS PAY THE GRIDCO A FEE FOR OPERATIOS AND NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LLC I KNOW THIS IS CONFUSING BUT APPARENTLY TVA IS SAYING THE SAME THING AS MEAG I WILL DISCUSS THIS FURTHER WITH MEAG THIS WEEK I like the concept of a Gridco forprofit company that does not own assets but operates transmission grid It seems to blend pros and cons well Key will be incentives THEY ARE SETTING IT UP TO EVENTUALLY OWN ASSETS YES THE INITIAL KEY IS INCENTIVES AND THE TRANSMISSION OWNERS ARE CONTROLLING THE INCENTIVES AS A PART OF THERE STATED REQUIREMENT TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS I agree with SOCO that ST Reliability authority does not extend to initial unit commitment and dispatch decisions for generators Does this imply no tight pool From later description it looks like SOCO is proposing LMP for settlements THE RTO IS NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN UNIT COMMITMENT OR DISPATCH DECISIONS UNLESS MANDATORY REDISPATCH IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN FIRM SERVICE OR THERE IS A SYSTEM EMERGENCY Not sure that I like the conclusion that SERC Southern subregion is preferred but probably not much success in pushing for bigger region APPARENTLY THEY COULD NOT GET CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER WITH GRIDSOUTH TO COMBINE INITIALLY SOUTHERN REALIZES THEY WILL HAVE TROUBLE AT FERC ABOUT THE SIZE AND ARE JUST SAYING ITS BIG ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE STARTUP OF A RTO I wonder what TVA thinks about this filing WE ARE HEARING THAT TVA WANTS A NONPROFIT ARRANGEMENT AND CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT LEGISLATION WE NEED MORE DISCUSSION WITH THEM ALSO THATS NOT MY TERRITORY BUT ILL BE GLAD TO PURSUE IT Interesting idea that Gridco could become Transco for future transmission upgrades pg What form of capitalization would be necessary SOCO seems to think this wont happen THEY ARE SAYING PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR INITIAL FINANCING AND THINK IT WILL BE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY WILL HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH THE GRIDCO TO ALLOW ANY CONSIDERATION OF AN IPO Why does SOCO want Market Monitoring inside Gridco Why not have Gridco contract this service THEY THINK FERC WANTED THIS I THINK THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO TURN IT OVER TO A RD PARTY WE WILL ASK THEM THIS WEEK I dont think that SOCO should keep the ROFR for new transmission New transmission plant investment should be driven by market rewards I AGREE WE NEED TO PUSH FOR THIS TO BE OPEN AND FOR THE EXISTING OWNERS TO BE PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT Why not allow Enron to finance the Gridco operations Ongoing operations should be contained within OATT We may do it without any voting control Couldnt we finance a startup venture and sell services to SOCO THEY HAVE MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING AN ALTERNATE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INVOLVE A THIRD PARTY COMING IN TO JUST OPERATE THE RTO BUT AT THIS POINT THEY DO NOT KNOW OF ANYONE QUALIFIED TO DO IT OR INTERESTED IN DOING IT ARE YOU READY TO PROPOSE ENRON DOING THIS AND ALLOWING IT TO BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT I think that SOCO should simply arrange for Gridco lease of TO facilities for years with an option to buy or sell I dont really understand why TOs would pay a fee to have Gridco operate their assets pg SAME AS ABOVE THE ONLY TIME A FEE IS PAID IS WHEN A NONLLC TRANSMISSION OWNER TURNS THEIR OPERATIONS OVER TO THE GRIDCO Agree with providing Gridco incentives to operate well including maybe losing money pg How do these get established THE TRANSMISSION OWNERS PLAN TO SET THE INCENTIVES AND CONTROL ANY CHANGES Why have the TOs determine the Board of Directors Gridco is an independent selffinanced company SOCO may not want to sign a lease with Gridco but it shouldnt determine BoD THEY WANT TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS AND CONSIDER THIS NECESSARY TO DO SO I dont understand the restriction on potentially significant adverse effect on value of

DISCUSSED THIS WEEK Disagree with RTO operating secondary market for FTRs pg I THINK THEY THINK THIS IS NEEDED JUST TO KEEP UP WITH WHATS AGREED TO WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO GIVE IT UP IF EVERYONE IS ALWAYS AWARE OF WHO OWNS WHAY RIGHTS Does RTO only operate kv and above What about lower voltages THEY MODIFIED THAT LAST WEEK WILL BE WHATEVER THE GRIDCO DECIDES IS NEEDED FOR WHOLESALE SAID THEY WERE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE KV SYSTEM BUT WOULD USE FERCS FACTOR TEST TO DECIDE Transmission Pricing is probably biggest problem given SOCO insistenance on retail bundled customers pg AGREE AMEA HAS RAISED A QUESTION ABOUT PRICE SQUEEZE BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO GENERATION TO SERVE THEIR LOAD THAN IT WOULD BE FOR ALABAMA POWER TO SERVE THE SAME LOAD SOCO proposal on initial ROE as wgt avg as highest of states jurisdiction is worth how much DONT KNOW HOW MUCH HAVENT SEEN ANY NUMBERS YET Does Enron have a policy on Transmission Losses THOUGHT YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PRICE CERTAINTY AND COMPARABILITY IF THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS LET ME KNOW On incentives for new Transmission plant why not give developers the FTRs created DONT THINK SOUTHERN IS EVEN THINKING ABOUT RD PARTIES BUILDING TRANSMISSION AT THIS POINT In general an interesting opening offer from SOCO I guess I am still confused over how a bundled retail customer will have priority in this model We also need to work with state PUCs to see what they are thinking about this Especially to try and learn what SOCO is saying about Native Load exception Finally SOCO seems to say only one control area Is this right Jim YES ONLY ONE CONTROL AREA IS WHAT THEY PROPOSE BUT WILL ALLOW MORE THAN ONE I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TELLING THE OTHER POTENTIAL PARTIES THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY GET ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE RTO AT A POSTAGE STAMP RATE IS TO AGREE TO ONE CONTROL AREA NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRIORITY OF BUNDLED RETAIL LOOKS LIKE THEY GET NONE JUST PROTECTION FROM ANY SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASE WITH THE TRANSITION I AGREE WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON THE PUCS PLAN TO START ASAP

following that should be concerned Calpine Enron ISO NE Midwest ISO NY ISO PJM Southern Energy and US Gen Concerning Christis question on whether we need a computer group looking at the question of redundancy of systems I dont think we need it at this point It is a given that a complete backup system for all commercial aspects of the systems will be required along with a handoff protocol for emergency control over all transmission operational aspects of the systems The specifics of these need to be decided when the hierarchy of each RTO is determined Original Message From Shapiro Richard

is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning They have almost no experience dealing with security either cyber or otherwise They are using the terrorist attacks on the th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old YK contingency plans and cash in on peoples fears to strengthen their position In any case I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC Look at NERCs offices They are in a shopping mall How secure is that Last time I visited they didnt even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything the whole place was wide open Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERCs infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers Contrast that with places like ISONE and NYISO who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex Or compare that with the MISOs hardened facility capable of withstanding an F tornado hit You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous Thats akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider a terrorist isnt going to attack a tariff desk market system or security coordinator they will attack nuclear units substations and other installations that actually matter I echo Daves question do we want to call NERC on this issue It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERCs many security failings including some initiatives they are currently sitting on Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud By the way am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this rd grade cleverness of NIMDA is ADMIN spelled

Affairs Committee NAERO Working Group FROM Scott Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at or

<12827828.1075861632639.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joe.connor@enron.com,2001-11-10 21:00:40,RE Southern Company releases reports on nations transmission system Cc I talked to Bill Newman Southern about this proposal yesterday I asked Bill if we were correct in reading the proposal to say that Southern was now open to consider the use of financial rights for transmission rather than physical rights He said that was correct I asked him if they were also willing to consider an auction as a mechanism to allocate financial rights He said they would consider an auction as long as they could have a way to obtain the rights needed to serve native load without driving up the cost of that service This is a major change in Southerns position and may open the door for resolving the major differences between the SETrans group and the Grids on congestion management functions assuming the Grids stay with the approach that came out of the FERC mediation sessions I also asked Bill if he was negotiating with Entergy to form an RTO He said he could not confirm that officially but confidentially they were talking a lot more and we should see something in a couple of weeks He also indicated that this was the reason they were now open to the financial rights approach Based on the above I think the Southern transmission pricing proposal was their attempt to gain support of the PSCs by addressing the PSCs concerns about transmission cost increases and to open the door to resolving the differences Southern has had with Entergy over financial vs physical transmission rights As far as the proposal is concerned and the study by the Analysis GroupEconomics there are a lot of issues we could raise with both The study is only valid for the specific assumptions they made rolled in rates for all transmission and longterm sales from Henry Hub to PJM and Southerns proposal once again leaves too much unspecified to know exactly what they intended I think we would be best served by taking the position that we welcome the study report pointing out the some of the very issues that need to be addressed in the next phase being proposed by FERC for the development of a Southeast RTO and we are glad to note that the Analysis Group recognized that many of the issues raised could be resolved by previous proposals to reform transmission pricing such as the proposal to auction financial rights that Enron has been advocating We are also pleased to note that Southern has also recognized the use of financial rights as a viable alternative to physical transmission rights Please let me know if you do not agree with the above approach and Ill give you a list of issues we could raise with the Southern proposal But I think we should wait a couple of weeks and see if Southern and Entergy have something put together we can address Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Fri AM To Connor Joe Cc Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Subject FW Southern Company releases reports on nations transmission system Joe Can you please give me your comments on this report by Southern Also what do you think that Southern intends to gain for itself I guess that the zonal model would force all generation to site on the boundries of Southern This goes against the single rate model for RTOs that FERC appears to desire continues pancaking Jim Original Message From Samantha Slater ENRON Sent Friday November AM To Linnell Elizabeth Kingerski Harry Robinson Marchris Petrochko Mona L Kaufman Paul Montovano Steve Landwehr Susan M Subject Southern Company releases reports on nations transmission system Southern Company releases reports on nations transmission system Thursday November Contact Laura A Gillig or Southern Company today released two reports on critical issues facing the nations electric transmission system that need increased attention by federal policymakers The first report authored by the economics consulting firm Analysis GroupEconomics Inc presents some of the key problems with traditional regulatory policies that are inhibiting investment in new transmission facilities and distorting location decisions by new generators On October Allen Franklin Southern Companys chairman president and CEO testified before Congress regarding the need to provide better transmission pricing signals to generators so that they will be incented to locate closer to customers and in areas not requiring substantial new transmission investment The problem presented is critical to Southern Company as over MW of new generation is seeking to locate in Southern Companys service area an amount far greater than will be needed by area consumers Most of this generation will be sold outside of the region and will require major expansion of the transmission system In most of these cases it would have cost less and have been more reliable to locate the generation closer to its customers but because generators dont face the true costs they impose on the transmission system they are more likely to locate closer to sources of gas to fuel the plants without regard to the transmission costs imposed The study conducted by Analysis GroupEconomics finds that it generally would be less expensive to locate generation close to consumers and build gas pipelines when needed than to build generation near the gas fields and transmit the power to consumers located far away Yet under current Federal regulatory policies where gas pipeline pricing is distance sensitive and transmission pricing is not exactly the wrong price signal is being provided to generators Inconsistent pricing simply does not make sense for two competing energy infrastructures Southern Company has proposed a solution to this current inefficient pricing regime which is described in the second report being released today a Southern Company Transmission Pricing Proposal The proposed solution is a regulated pricing framework that takes into account the major factors that affect the incremental costs of providing transmission service distance congestion and losses more closely aligning electric transmission and gas pipeline pricing policies Distance sensitivity is factored into the pricing proposal by using a zonal rate system where longer distance transactions over multiple zones pay more than shorter transactions within a zone Congestion is dealt with through the use of locational marginal pricing and losses are handled through distancebased loss factors or some other method of measuring marginal losses The Southern Company proposal also suggests that generators who create the need for transmission upgrades that do not benefit other customers should pay for those upgrades in return for which they would receive rights to use the transmission system without paying congestion costs These transmission rights could be sold to third parties in a secondary market This form of participant funding will ensure that generators face the costs of the location decisions they make leading to more efficient decisions and eliminating uneconomic and unnecessary transmission investment and thus reducing energy costs for consumers The Southern Company proposal also points to the importance of sufficient returns on transmission investments to provide the proper incentives for expansion of the networks The nature of the transmission business is changing dramatically and returns have to be reevaluated as a result Also emphasized is the importance of incentive or performancebased rates particularly for regional transmission organizations that are being formed around the country and the need to eliminate regulatory lag for cost recovery of the substantial investments that will be made in the transmission system over the next decade
