a ssuming a quick sale based on a unitsof production depreciation method t o avoid impairment problems going forward of approx million These t ogether are approx million of loss but again I have suggested that t hese need to be taken whether we sell or not The sellhold decision re t he Duke deal is a loss of million adjusted NBV after impairmentsdep r catchup of million less the of sales proceeds in exchange for the million in cash So sale is proposed at below book JeanLisa would think of the Duke deal as MarinerBurlington cash flows being discou nted at plus a premium of million
