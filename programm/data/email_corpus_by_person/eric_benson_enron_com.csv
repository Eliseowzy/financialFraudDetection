electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate

system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer

Forwarded by Eric BensonNAEnron on PM PM To cc Subject Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along CERA Monthly Briefin g Title Western Energy Markets Stuggle Along URL eprofileuDmD Western Market Overview As the California power crisis remains unresolved and blackouts in Californ ia have gone from threat to reality the western gas and power markets grow increasingly distorted by the perceived risk of selling energy to Californi as two largest utilities Normal power plant operations and power pricing dynamics have been supplanted with federal mandates to deliver power to California and power basis differentials are being influenced by credit risk Regional hydroelectric supplies have been drawn down at abnormally rapid rates to me et current demand such that in the absence of increased precipitation through out the West suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outpu t in February and later in the year Gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary about shouldering the increased risk Natural gas and power prices have declined from Decembers record levels driven in part by Januarytodate weather that has been warmer than normal Although Topock gas prices remain above the per million British thermal units MMBtu level basis differentials to the Henry Hub have declined dramatically from a premium over Henry Hub prices of per MMBtu in Decem ber to an average of per MMBtu in January Demand levels will likely hold near January levels during February as the already intense pull of gas for power generation continues Because storage levels in California remain low the California citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during spells of cold weather Differentials for February are expected to average to per MMBtu in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan producing bas ins during February per MMBtu at AECO and per MMBtu at Topock Power prices in January have followed both the decline in gas prices and th e shift to warmer weather However there is growing unease in the power mark ets with the dry precipitation season to date A significantly lowerthanavera ge hydroelectric season would permeate through the power markets for all of placing gasfired generation on the margin virtually the entire year CERA has incorporated a lowerthataverage view of hydroelectric generation into its gas and power analyses February onpeak power prices are expected to average per megawatthour MWh in February depending on location but tempor ary price spikes are likely as California reserves reach critically low levels and the independent system operator ISO struggles to secure enough power to k eep the lights on Offpeak power prices are also expected to remaining strong averaging per MWh in February depending on location Regional Power Market Drivers Low Precipitation Threatens Already Difficul t Disappointing levels of precipitation have raised the specter that the power markets will be plagued by a belowaverage hydroelectric year Seasonto date precipitation is currently percent of normal in the upper Columbia River Basin in British Columbia to percent of normal in the US Colum bia River Basin and percent of normal for California January hydroelectric output westwide has been higher than normal as operators have run faciliti es hard to supply energy during December and January energy shortages In comi ng months however output will be down roughly average megawatts aMW compared with the first quarter of owing in part to this early drawdo wn CERA has incorporated an outlook for hydroelectric production in that is approximately percent of CERAs estimate for an average western hydro year see Table Concerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of Pacifi c Northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the Pacific Northwest particularly vulnerable to higher prices in February as winter weatherdriven demand spikes challenge regional supplies and California demand prevents a significant le vel of exports from California to the Pacific Northwest Even under normal hydroelectric conditions demand growth in early was expected to push the utilization rates of US Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC gasfired generation facilities to percent well above th e percent average level of the first quarter see Table The combine d effects of the early drawdown of hydroelectric facilities a disappointing precipitation season and demand growth will push these utilization rates t o nearly percent in the first quarter This will cause markets to cl ear at or above the production cost of gasfired generation even more often tha n in Pacific Northwest Hydroelectric generators in the Pacific Northwest have drawn down the regio ns hydroelectric reservoirs to well below average historical levels Grand Coulee the largest hydroelectric facility in the West with over megawatts MW of capacity was near percent of the historical average as of early Janu ary and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region I n the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha s hurt the regions ability to supply power throughout and will maint ain upward pressure on power prices Aboveaverage temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest Strong demand grow th for the first quarter near percent is expected however owing to economi c growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see Table Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the to per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win ter to cause price spikes well above the per MWh onpeak levels so far in January although average prices should be much lower Decembers averag e of per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly see Table Along with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in February cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels CERA expects MidColumbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo r a monthly average of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Continue d drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weatherrelated events would push pri ces periodically to Decembers high levels California Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly percent warmer than usual January prices have reflected percent demand growth over owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe d gasfired generators onto the margin more often with higher gas prices at Topock by MMBtu low hydroelectric availability westwide and the degrad ed condition of the California power market Northern California snowpacks hav e been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near percent of normal in spite of recent storms Reservoir levels for the state are betwee n and percent of average depending on location but are in the to percentofaverage range for reservoirs affecting the states largest hydroelectric facilities As Californias largest investorowned utilities IOUs continue to stru ggle to obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency Californ ia power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state January differentials with western prices have grown a s high as per MWh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear and other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over MW Northern Californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes e temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w ill increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the IOUs an d state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but California will be the premium mar ket through the first quarter of and most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness For February in California CERA expects sustai ned price strength of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Rockies and the Southwest The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs t half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price runu ps in other parts of the West Demand growth in the region is expected to be n ear percent for the first quarter with February experiencing moderate perc ent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived California and Pacific Northwest markets Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri ng the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceed percent at th is time Compared with California prices prices in the Southwest and Rockies region s will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation MW or percent of the installed base in the region CERAs outlook for onpeak average price for February is p er MWh Offpeak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly per MWh below the Southwest reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more influence on the Southwest than on the Rockies Western Gas Markets Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels winter is far from over in the West indeed the pressure is intensifying The cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within California are again at critically low level s The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement in the positions but when PGEs suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies As a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately billion cubic feet Bcf A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see Table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a nd Malin to settle back into the to premium to the Henry Hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per MMBtu In the Rockies and San Juan Basins differentials will depend critically on the weather Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials CERA expects the swings to continue through February with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the end of the month As high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge CERA estimates that MMcf per day of base industrial demand in the Westparticularly in Californiahas switched off of gas Some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices On the power side plants within California are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits However plants outside of California do have some backup capability Arizona Public Servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas Given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads California In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions about winter deliverability within the state A combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on California prices through February see Table Despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices C ERA expects demand during January in the state is up by MMcf per day on a year overyear basis In February loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month However power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric generation falls This demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into California and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February During periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per MMBtu range Eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of February differentials should ease back into the to per MMBtu range On balance CERA expects a Topock differential fo r February of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February First th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads Second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo r power generation during a season when the pull is normally low Third the California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin g the demand for gas for power generation Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu during February A dropoff in demand of MMcf per day is expected in March as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation However prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs That early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months Both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther n California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the spring Rocky Mountains The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues Differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub Duri ng February demand should drop off in the region Although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the Rockies remain primarily coal based As a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region Increases in supplyCERA expects supply increases of MMcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at Bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially This w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and CERA expects average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of per MMBtu That widening trend should continue during March with differentials to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes For February continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support prices in the San Juan barring unusually warm weather CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an d March prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply CERA expects decli nes in San Juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade However pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the San Juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production Pipeline capacity constraints out of the San Juan will again mean wide San JuantoHenry Hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months Western Canada Increasing Supply AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between per MMBtu and over per MMBtu Given strong demand in the United States export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter Even the Bcf per day Alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity Given these flow levels CERA expects differentials to remain near the to per MMBtu level reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada the only available export capacity out of Alberta For February CERA expects a differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US winter demand to refilling Canadian storage On the supply side production has turned the corner in western Canada and yearoveryear increases in supply of nearly MMcf per day are now evide nt After flat production levels for relative to increases for the y ear should reach MMcf per day Given strong expected demand from California and the West Coast CERA expects no declines in yearoveryear flows into the West on PGE GT NW Overall flows should reach Bcf

this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po wer system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state However the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs Recent audits indicate that SCE and PGE recovered their stranded costs early in wh ich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes A legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future in Houston February For more information and to

Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per

to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and

Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the

As the California power crisis remains unresolved and blackouts in Californ ia have gone from threat to reality the western gas and power markets grow increasingly distorted by the perceived risk of

precipitation through out the West suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outpu t in February and later in the year Gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary about shouldering the increased risk Natural gas and power prices have declined from Decembers record levels driven in part by Januarytodate weather that has been warmer than normal Although Topock gas prices remain above the per million British thermal units MMBtu level basis differentials to the Henry Hub have declined dramatically from a premium over Henry Hub prices of per MMBtu in Decem ber to an average of per MMBtu in January Demand levels will likely hold near January levels during February as the already intense pull of gas for power generation continues Because storage levels in California remain low the California citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during spells of cold weather Differentials for February are expected to average to per MMBtu in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan producing bas ins during February per MMBtu at AECO and per MMBtu at Topock Power prices in January have followed both the decline in gas prices and th e shift to warmer weather However there is growing unease in the power mark ets with the dry precipitation season to date A significantly lowerthanavera ge hydroelectric season would permeate through the power markets for all of placing gasfired generation on the margin virtually the entire year CERA has incorporated a lowerthataverage view of hydroelectric generation into its gas and power analyses February onpeak power prices are expected to average per megawatthour MWh in February depending on location but tempor ary price spikes are likely as California reserves reach critically low levels and the independent system operator ISO struggles to secure enough power to k eep the lights on Offpeak power prices are also expected to remaining strong averaging per MWh in February depending on location Regional Power Market Drivers Low Precipitation Threatens Already Difficul t Disappointing levels of precipitation have raised the specter that the power markets will be plagued by a belowaverage hydroelectric year Seasonto date precipitation is currently percent of normal in the upper Columbia River Basin in British Columbia to percent of normal in the US Colum bia River Basin and percent of normal for California January hydroelectric output westwide has been higher than normal as operators have run faciliti es hard to supply energy during December and January energy shortages In comi ng months however output will be down roughly average megawatts aMW compared with the first quarter of owing in part to this early drawdo wn CERA has incorporated an outlook for hydroelectric production in that is approximately percent of CERAs estimate for an average western hydro year see Table Concerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of Pacifi c Northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the Pacific Northwest particularly vulnerable to higher prices in February as winter weatherdriven demand spikes challenge regional supplies and California demand prevents a significant le vel of exports from California to the Pacific Northwest Even under normal hydroelectric conditions demand growth in early was expected to push the utilization rates of US Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC gasfired generation facilities to percent well above th e percent average level of the first quarter see Table The combine d effects of the early drawdown of hydroelectric facilities a disappointing precipitation season and demand growth will push these utilization rates t o nearly percent in the first quarter This will cause markets to cl ear at or above the production cost of gasfired generation even more often tha n in Pacific Northwest Hydroelectric generators in the Pacific Northwest have drawn down the regio ns hydroelectric reservoirs to well below average historical levels Grand Coulee the largest hydroelectric facility in the West with over megawatts MW of capacity was near percent of the historical average as of early Janu ary and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region I n the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha s hurt the regions ability to supply power throughout and will maint ain upward pressure on power prices Aboveaverage temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest Strong demand grow th for the first quarter near percent is expected however owing to economi c growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see Table Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the to per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win ter to cause price spikes well above the per MWh onpeak levels so far in January although average prices should be much lower Decembers averag e of per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly see Table Along with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in February cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels CERA expects MidColumbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo r a monthly average of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Continue d drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weatherrelated events would push pri ces periodically to Decembers high levels California Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly percent warmer than usual January prices have reflected percent demand growth over owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe d gasfired generators onto the margin more often with higher gas prices at Topock by MMBtu low hydroelectric availability westwide and the degrad ed condition of the California power market Northern California snowpacks hav e been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near percent of normal in spite of recent storms Reservoir levels for the state are betwee n and percent of average depending on location but are in the to percentofaverage range for reservoirs affecting the states largest hydroelectric facilities As Californias largest investorowned utilities IOUs continue to stru ggle to obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency Californ ia power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state January differentials with western prices have grown a s high as per MWh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear and other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over MW Northern Californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes e temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w ill increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the IOUs an d state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but California will be the premium mar ket through the first quarter of and most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness For February in California CERA expects sustai ned price strength of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Rockies and the Southwest The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs t half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price runu ps in other parts of the West Demand growth in the region is expected to be n ear percent for the first quarter with February experiencing moderate perc ent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived California and Pacific Northwest markets Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri ng the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceed percent at th is time Compared with California prices prices in the Southwest and Rockies region s will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation MW or percent of the installed base in the region CERAs outlook for onpeak average price for February is p er MWh Offpeak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly per MWh below the Southwest reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more influence on the Southwest than on the Rockies Western Gas Markets Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels winter is far from over in the West indeed the pressure is intensifying The cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within California are again at critically low level s The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement in the positions but when PGEs suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies As a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately billion cubic feet Bcf A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see Table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a nd Malin to settle back into the to premium to the Henry Hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per MMBtu In the Rockies and San Juan Basins differentials will depend critically on the weather Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials CERA expects the swings to continue through February with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the end of the month As high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge CERA estimates that MMcf per day of base industrial demand in the Westparticularly in Californiahas switched off of gas Some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices On the power side plants within California are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits However plants outside of California do have some backup capability Arizona Public Servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas Given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads California In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions about winter deliverability within the state A combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on California prices through February see Table Despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices C ERA expects demand during January in the state is up by MMcf per day on a year overyear basis In February loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month However power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric generation falls This demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into California and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February During periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per MMBtu range Eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of February differentials should ease back into the to per MMBtu range On balance CERA expects a Topock differential fo r February of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February First th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads Second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo r power generation during a season when the pull is normally low Third the California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin g the demand for gas for power generation Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu during February A dropoff in demand of MMcf per day is expected in March as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation However prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs That early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months Both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther n California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the spring Rocky Mountains The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues Differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub Duri ng February demand should drop off in the region Although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the Rockies remain primarily coal based As a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region Increases in supplyCERA expects supply increases of MMcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at Bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially This w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and CERA expects average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of per MMBtu That widening trend should continue during March with differentials to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes For February continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support prices in the San Juan barring unusually warm weather CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an d March prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply CERA expects decli nes in San Juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade However pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the San Juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production Pipeline capacity constraints out of the San Juan will again mean wide San JuantoHenry Hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months Western Canada Increasing Supply AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between per MMBtu and over per MMBtu Given strong demand in the United States export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter Even the Bcf per day Alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity Given these flow levels CERA expects differentials to remain near the to per MMBtu level reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada the only available export capacity out of Alberta For February CERA expects a differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US winter demand to refilling Canadian storage On the supply side production has turned the corner in western Canada and yearoveryear increases in supply of nearly MMcf per day are now evide nt After flat production levels for relative to increases for the y ear should reach MMcf per day Given strong expected demand from California and the West Coast CERA expects no declines in yearoveryear flows into the West on PGE GT NW Overall flows should reach Bcf

Grand Coulee the largest hydroelectric facility in the West with over megawatts MW of capacity was near percent of the historical average as of early Janu ary and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region I n the event that precipitation remains low the drawdown of these facilities in early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha s hurt the regions ability to supply power throughout and will maint ain upward pressure on power prices Aboveaverage temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest Strong demand grow th for the first quarter near percent is expected however owing to economi c growth and a return to normal weather from last years mild winter see Table Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the to per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win ter to cause price spikes well above the per MWh onpeak levels so far in January although average prices should be much lower Decembers averag e of per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly see Table Along with demand growth near percent yearoveryear in February cold snaps will again bring price runups particularly in the event that persistent low precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators to draw down facilities past alreadylow levels CERA expects MidColumbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo r a monthly average of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Continue d drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weatherrelated events would push pri ces periodically to Decembers high levels California Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly percent warmer than usual January prices have reflected percent demand growth over owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe d gasfired generators onto the margin more often with higher gas prices at Topock by MMBtu low hydroelectric availability westwide and the degrad ed condition of the California power market Northern California snowpacks hav e been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near percent of normal in spite of recent storms Reservoir levels for the state are betwee n and percent of average depending on location but are in the to percentofaverage range for reservoirs affecting the states largest hydroelectric facilities As Californias largest investorowned utilities IOUs continue to stru ggle to obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency Californ ia power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of supplying the state January differentials with western prices have grown a s high as per MWh owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear and other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over MW Northern Californias import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes e temporary shortages suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w ill increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive future outages The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers the IOUs an d state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price inflating uncertainty in the market but California will be the premium mar ket through the first quarter of and most of the coming year owing to persistent supply tightness For February in California CERA expects sustai ned price strength of per MWh on peak and per MWh off peak Rockies and the Southwest The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs t half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price runu ps in other parts of the West Demand growth in the region is expected to be n ear percent for the first quarter with February experiencing moderate perc ent growth suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to interconnections with the hydrodeprived California and Pacific Northwest markets Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri ng the winter andas an isolated subregionwould exceed percent at th is time Compared with California prices prices in the Southwest and Rockies region s will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation MW or percent of the installed base in the region CERAs outlook for onpeak average price for February is p er MWh Offpeak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly per MWh below the Southwest reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more influence on the Southwest than on the Rockies Western Gas Markets Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels winter is far from over in the West indeed the pressure is intensifying The cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within California are again at critically low level s The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement in the positions but when PGEs suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies As a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately billion cubic feet Bcf A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see Table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a nd Malin to settle back into the to premium to the Henry Hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per MMBtu In the Rockies and San Juan Basins differentials will depend critically on the weather Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials CERA expects the swings to continue through February with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the end of the month As high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge CERA estimates that MMcf per day of base industrial demand in the Westparticularly in Californiahas switched off of gas Some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices On the power side plants within California are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits However plants outside of California do have some backup capability Arizona Public Servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas Given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads California In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions about winter deliverability within the state A combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on California prices through February see Table Despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices C ERA expects demand during January in the state is up by MMcf per day on a year overyear basis In February loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month However power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric generation falls This demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into California and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February During periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per MMBtu range Eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of February differentials should ease back into the to per MMBtu range On balance CERA expects a Topock differential fo r February of per MMBtu see Table Pacific Northwest Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February First th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads Second lowerthannormal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo r power generation during a season when the pull is normally low Third the California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin g the demand for gas for power generation Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level s during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand The sustained hig h demand levelsdespite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev els will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices CERA expects a Malin to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu during February A dropoff in demand of MMcf per day is expected in March as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation However prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs That early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months Both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther n California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the spring Rocky Mountains The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues Differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub Duri ng February demand should drop off in the region Although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the Rockies remain primarily coal based As a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region Increases in supplyCERA expects supply increases of MMcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at Bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially This w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and CERA expects average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of per MMBtu That widening trend should continue during March with differentials to the Henry Hub eventually reaching per MMBtu this summer Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads That dynamic will likely continue through February CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the Southwest As in the West as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes For February continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support prices in the San Juan barring unusually warm weather CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of per MMBtu As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an d March prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply CERA expects decli nes in San Juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade However pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the San Juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production Pipeline capacity constraints out of the San Juan will again mean wide San JuantoHenry Hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months Western Canada Increasing Supply AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between per MMBtu and over per MMBtu Given strong demand in the United States export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter Even the Bcf per day Alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity Given these flow levels CERA expects differentials to remain near the to per MMBtu level reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada the only available export capacity out of Alberta For February CERA expects a differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of per MMBtu Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as US inventory levels Inventories in the West are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US winter demand to refilling Canadian storage On the supply side production has turned the corner in western Canada and yearoveryear increases in supply of nearly MMcf per day are now evide nt After flat production levels for relative to increases for the y ear should reach MMcf per day Given strong expected demand from California and the West Coast CERA expects no declines in yearoveryear flows into the West on PGE GT NW Overall flows should reach Bcf per day for an increase of MMcf per day from levels end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future in

your review and files please advise if additional material is requested Eric Benson DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Forwarded by Eric BensonNAEnron on PM PM To cc Subject Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase CERA Alert Title Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase URL eprofileuDmD Californias Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase On February the California Assembly approved and the California governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California The legislature has been meeting since early January in a special extraordi nary session to address the power market crisis in the state and the new la w represents their first significant piece of legislation The bill AB establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the states busines ses and consumers Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the limited revenue source used to pay for the powercollected by the state s investorowned utilities IOUs under current retail rateswill cover wholesale power market costs incurred by the state The law reflects the obsession by California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the underlying flaws in Californias market structure AB ushers in several important changes to the California market structure It also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the state Highlights of the bill include Power buying authority transferred The responsibility for purchasing pow er for the customers of Californias IOUs has been transferred to the Calif ornia Department of Water Resources CDWR The California utilities will continu e to operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts T he difference between the utilities total load and the sum of their resour ces referred to as the utilities net short amount will be supplie d by CDWR an amount of energy that varies between and megawatts MW depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability The utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the California Power Exchange PX However CDWR has been buying electricity o n behalf of the IOUs since midJanuary when the nearbankruptcy of Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas Electric PGE threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers CDWR is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state CDWR uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator ISO In addition CDWRs reservoirs generate power The CDWR is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of Californias utilities Portfolio of transactions The intent of AB is to allow CDWR to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers CDWR has until January to execute contracts CDWR will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse It has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including month ly annual twoyear threeyear and longer CDWR may also enter into options Thus although CDWRs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years Power for munis CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election New payment scheme CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses This payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kWh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services The CDWR share of retail ra tes is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment CPA It is not clear whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs Current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA In addition if investors believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned New bonds Bonds will be issued to secure power The total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the CPA The state will transfer mill ion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately This seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the Califor nia utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in New residential rate freeze The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations This locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely Governor Gray Davis thus ke eps his pledge not to increase rates further Retail competition To help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds AB enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until CDWRs obligations are paid Although the CPUC has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra m Taxpayer protection AB directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond Thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates No assets affected The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets Ironically the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions The utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts In addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices California has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function SCE and PGE are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved It is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved The law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs Alternatively CDWR could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met These contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time AB is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po wer system in California to a more stable footing Key tasks remain Californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in California remains unchanged The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities In addition Californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants AB does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of Californias utilities The state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state However the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs Recent audits indicate that SCE and PGE recovered their stranded costs early in wh ich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes A legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end Follow above URL for full report Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek Shooting the Rapids Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future in Houston February For more information and to
