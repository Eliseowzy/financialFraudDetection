Increases Data Throughput DA LLAS Oct PRNewswire via COMTEX Texas Instruments NYSE TXN TI today introduced a new logic family Advanced UltraLow Voltage CMOS AUC which are optimized at V but are operational to sub V levels T he AUC family provides significant benefits to portable consumer electronic s computing and telecom applications by operating at low power and high sp eed while maintaining overall system signal integrity See wwwticomsca uc The family consists of Little Logic singledualtriple gates octa ls and WideBustm devices All devices are optimized at V and have an operating voltage range of V to V With a voltage tolerance of V AUC extends the life of systems by allowing legacy devices to remain fun ctional In addition the subV feature allows AUC to be operated by a si ngle cell battery AUC also includes Ioff which protects the device by sup porting partial power down applications TI has been working closely with Philips and IDT to develop the specifications for the new AUC family Init ially TI will release Little Logic and Philips will offer an alternate sou rce Subsequently in IDT Philips and TI will release Octals and Wi deBus devices Based on this collaboration alternate source agreements are in place TI continues to take the logic market into new areas by devel oping leading technologies and innovative products The introduction of the new AUC family enables customers to gain higher performance as they move t o the lower voltage node DSPs and highperformance analog ICs said David Hoover worldwide product marketing manager for TIs Standard Linear and Lo gic Products In addition optimizing the family at V extends battery life while also speeding up data throughput in the system Little Logic AUC The AUC family is available in singledualtriple gate devices for po rtable consumer electronics Consistent with the family the Little Logic A UC devices are optimized at V while maintaining high speed and low noi se Essential to the success of portable consumer applications the devices extend battery life while maintaining very good signal integrity The Litt le Logic devices will be available in various packaging options including NanoStartm packaging the worlds smallest logic package Philips foc us on providing leading Pico Gate solutions for the consumer networking a nd communications markets makes the alternate source agreement for AUC tech nology a perfect match said Bruce Potvin director of marketing logic pro ducts Working with TI we are able to deliver a true alternate source for AUC Little Logic devices that offer highperformance industry leading sol utions WidebusOctal AUC For telecommunications and computing applica tions the AUC family of devices offer high speed data throughput and enhan ced signal integrity that is critical to performance Speed for the Widebus devices is a very fast ns ns typical The V provides a logic migration for lower operating voltages and simplifies the system design l earning curve The AUC family enhances IDTs highperformance low voltag e logic portfolio by enabling us to keep pace with the industry as custome rs migrate to lower operating nodes said Kevin Walsh director of strateg ic marketing for IDTs Timing and Logic Division As a company strongly fo cused on communications we believe it is important to use our digital desi gn expertise to be a

TI brings power efficienc y and ease of use to batteryoperated systems and PC peripherals With its high output drive and builtin protection features the new charge pumps of fer savings in board space and system cost Being the first stepdown or buck charge pumps introduced by TI the new family of devices extends TI s comprehensive portfolio of powersupply solutions for lowvoltage applica tions including personal digital assistants and Internet audio players Se e powerticomaapu The new TPSx stepdown charge pumps offer regulated output voltages ranging from to volts V in order to pow er lowvoltage components in portable and buspowered systems The charge p umps take an input voltage range from V to V enabling use with a var iety of battery types Additionally a low quiescent current of only mic roamps uA allows for longer standby times At mA the family provides the highest output current in the industry and is capable of supporting mu ltiple components within a system Finally with the TPSx only four sm all ceramic capacitors are required to build a complete highefficiency cha rge pump power converter thereby saving board space and cost With the introduction of stepdown charge pumps TI expands its existing line of lin ear regulators and inductive stepdown converters offering a more complete selection of voltage regulator solutions said Guenter Sporer systems eng ineering manager for Low Power DCDC Converter Products at TI With lowvo ltage applications becoming more specialized customers know that they can rely on TI for power supply solutions that meet their system requirements Efficiency and Ease of Use The TPSx stepdown charge pumps offer o perating efficiencies comparable to inductive buck converters yet with the ease of use that is customary with linear regulators Peak efficiencies of percent are achieved by utilizing a fractional conversion topology resu lting in lower power dissipation and eliminating the need for heat sinking Supporting system flexibility the devices can be powered by three or four nickelcadmium NiCad nickelmetalhydride NiMH or alkaline batteries or by a single lithiumion Liion cell Requiring few external capacit ors and no inductors TPSx charge pumps simplify design and allow for a complete converter to be built in only square inches in To preve nt current leakage and prolong battery life the load is isolated from the battery during shutdown Added protection features include a soft start to limit inrush current a Power Good output voltage supervisor overtempera ture and overcurrent protection Available Today The

Involvement in Airport Security Screening Process AGOURA HILLS Calif Nov BUSINESS WIRE As the busiest holiday travel period approaches consumers are still planni ng to increase air travel Last weeks crash of Flight did not dramatic ally reduce confidence in air travel however travelers want more federal involvement in security measures according to the JD Power and Associate s and Yahoo Inc NasdaqYHOO report released today Among those who ha ve traveled within the last three months percent of air travelers say t hey are already comfortable with air travel This same group reports the level of travelers reporting they will never be comfortable rose from p ercent to percent The report shows being afraid to fly is still the most oftencited reason for curtailing air travel plans with nearly per cent of leisure travelers mentioning it as their number one reason Onethi rd of business travelers cited either economic conditions or company restri ctions on air travel as their top reasons for not flying Travelers have a strong preference for federal involvement in the airport security screeni ng process according to the report The highly publicized recent storie s of security lapses have greatly reduced the publics opinion of private a irport security companies said Michael Taylor director of travel service s at JD Power and Associates The public also feels stronger that a sear ch of checked baggage is necessary for airport security One thing that hasnt changed in the past month is the publics faith in technology to pro vide greater security Hightech scanners and bomb sniffers top the list of items travelers would like to see in airports A ban on restaurant cutle ry and national ID cards have the least impact on how safe consumers feel As for what can be done to increase inflight security armored cockpit doors would inspire as much confidence as sky marshals posted on random fli ghts said Taylor The percentage of people that feel air travel has ch anged forever is slowly dropping while the percentage of people perceivin g no difference increased from percent to percent The Flight tr agedy did not affect the percentage of travelers who are still undecided ab out their comfort level in flying which remained steady at one in five tra velers The survey was conducted two months after the worst air catastrop hes in the history of the United States
