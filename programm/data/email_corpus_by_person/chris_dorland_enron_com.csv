ToPaul CT Jan CT Jeff CT Dave CT Garrett CT Stephane BrodeurCAL CT Chris CT cc SubjectWhy One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas yahoocommentdetoxhtml Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis Senior Columnist Originally posted at PM ET on RealMoneycom A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is tell ing clients to quickly dump Enron ENE NYSE news believing that the e nergy trading giants earnings will fall well short of Wall Streets f orecasts Cambridge Massbased Off Wall Street led by analyst Mark Robe rts thinks Enrons earnings will fall cents short of the consensus estimate of The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around nearly below Wednesdays The firms page report publis hed May highlights Enrons declining profitability and increasing levera ge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs GS NYSE news which has a p ricetoearnings ratio about half of Enrons times OWS also alleges tha t Enrons earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat ements are confusing and opaque Houstonbased Enron didnt comment by pub lication time on elements of the report that Detox sent the company An en ergy analyst who is bullish on Enrons outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enrons business model but he says the report does include some groundbreaking and valid insights The analysts firm doesnt give stock recommendations Economi es of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes compared with say analy sts at Merrill Lynch MER NYSE news For one OWS has an excellent tra ck record Particularly sweet was when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve recommending that clients sell etailer pricelinecom PCLN Nasdaq news in June when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei r prices at their most insane Pulling Back Enron retreats after long rally Enron with its domination of a burgeoning energy market annual re venue of over billion and impressive earnings growth can hardly be ra nked alongside the likes of priceline But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr ecipitous drop nonetheless Why OWSs main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline Margins on Enrons pretax operating earnings whi ch the companys earnings releases call IBIT or income before interest ta xes and other items are falling Total IBIT of million in the first q uarter amounted to only of the billion in revenue for the period compared with a margin in the fourth quarter and in the yeare arlier period Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the yearearlier period yet IBIT rose only This shrinkage is due to lower margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enrons rev enue base OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of Enron needs to generate an extra billion in revenue for each additional penny it m akes over its EPS of to reach analysts expectation of T he energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasnt grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size In other words margins may decline but since revenues are so much higher earnings stil l go up Illustrating this firstquarter EPS of cents was ahea d of the yearago figure even though the IBIT margin shrank by percent age points The analyst thinks Enron will make per share in Gr owing On You In addition the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is likely to continue for several years according to the anal yst He notes that roughly of the electricity available in the US sti ll isnt traded in a market Eventually it will be part of a competitive e nvironment but itll take five to years says the analyst And he beli eves the extreme volatility in energyrelated commodities that has also ben efited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects Still OWSs point o n profitability is bolstered by other profit measures Return on capital n et income as a percentage of equity plus debt was in down on s and well below the returns on capital at Duke DUK NYSE n ews Dynegy DYN NYSE news and even Goldman Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow For ex ample it doesnt give a gross margin number for its wholesale services or trading business which accounts for of revenue But one area of the companys financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron s related party transactions which are the deals it does with entities th at have some sort of link to the firm In fact one of the related entities that Enron has traded with is headed by Enrons CFO Andrew Fastow The en ergy analyst comments Why are they doing this Its just inappropriate The reason for maintaining these hardtofollow related party deals has be en a source of speculation But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f iber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter of Estimated profits from the socalled dark fiber optical c able without the gear to send data over it transaction allowed Enron to be at analysts secondearnings earnings estimate by cents a share rather t han missing by cents How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Stree t on Enron

yahoocommentdetoxhtml Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis Senior Columnist Originally posted at PM ET on RealMoneycom A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is tell ing clients to quickly dump Enron ENE NYSE news believing that the e nergy trading giants earnings will fall well short of Wall Streets f orecasts Cambridge Massbased Off Wall Street led by analyst Mark Robe rts thinks Enrons earnings will fall cents short of the consensus estimate of The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around nearly below Wednesdays The firms page report publis hed May highlights Enrons declining profitability and increasing levera ge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs GS NYSE news which has a p ricetoearnings ratio about half of Enrons times OWS also alleges tha t Enrons earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat ements are confusing and opaque Houstonbased Enron didnt comment by pub lication time on elements of the report that Detox sent the company An en ergy analyst who is bullish on Enrons outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enrons business model but he says the report does include some groundbreaking and valid insights The analysts firm doesnt give stock recommendations Economi es of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes compared with say analy sts at Merrill Lynch MER NYSE news For one OWS has an excellent tra ck record Particularly sweet was when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve recommending that clients sell etailer pricelinecom PCLN Nasdaq news in June when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei r prices at their most insane Pulling Back Enron retreats after long rally Enron with its domination of a burgeoning energy market annual re venue of over billion and impressive earnings growth can hardly be ra nked alongside the likes of priceline But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr ecipitous drop nonetheless Why OWSs main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline Margins on Enrons pretax operating earnings whi ch the companys earnings releases call IBIT or income before interest ta xes and other items are falling Total IBIT of million in the first q uarter amounted to only of the billion in revenue for the period compared with a margin in the fourth quarter and in the yeare arlier period Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the yearearlier period yet IBIT rose only This shrinkage is due to lower margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enrons rev enue base OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of Enron needs to generate an extra billion in revenue for each additional penny it m akes over its EPS of to reach analysts expectation of T he energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasnt grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size In other words margins may decline but since revenues are so much higher earnings stil l go up Illustrating this firstquarter EPS of cents was ahea d of the yearago figure even though the IBIT margin shrank by percent age points The analyst thinks Enron will make per share in Gr owing On You In addition the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is likely to continue for several years according to the anal yst He notes that roughly of the electricity available in the US sti ll isnt traded in a market Eventually it will be part of a competitive e nvironment but itll take five to years says the analyst And he beli eves the extreme volatility in energyrelated commodities that has also ben efited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects Still OWSs point o n profitability is bolstered by other profit measures Return on capital n et income as a percentage of equity plus debt was in down on s and well below the returns on capital at Duke DUK NYSE n ews Dynegy DYN NYSE news and even Goldman Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow For ex ample it doesnt give a gross margin number for its wholesale services or trading business which accounts for of revenue But one area of the companys financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron s related party transactions which are the deals it does with entities th at have some sort of link to the firm In fact one of the related entities that Enron has traded with is headed by Enrons CFO Andrew Fastow The en ergy analyst comments Why are they doing this Its just inappropriate The reason for maintaining these hardtofollow related party deals has be en a source of speculation But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f iber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter of Estimated profits from the socalled dark fiber optical c able without the gear to send data over it transaction allowed Enron to be at analysts secondearnings earnings estimate by cents a share rather t han missing by cents How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Stree t on Enron

and white Enrons corporate colours from the marble to the sofas to the flowers wallpaper and pictures The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes furtrimmed sweaters and leather pants But in the excitement Enron lost touch with its mortality not to mention morality Mr Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks He wanted to recruit the best which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard his alma mater and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insidertrading scandals of the late s He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth Among the perks were the inhouse health club and doctors office as well as laundry and carwashing services Broadband traders were issued handheld computers and wireless laptops and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico Others accompanied Mr Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia One employee described how he got a discount in a tony mens clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron Elsewhere in town nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal Managers employed a system known as rank or yank with semiannual reviews in which every employees performance was ranked one to five As the names flashed on a projector the bosses graded them The bottom of workers were fired each year The pay was not particularly high trainees started at US The Wall Street Journal reported But they could double that when bonuses were added Bonus day was known as Car Day because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees US Porsches were the vehicle of choice To the outside world Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours Inside it became increasingly incestuous sexually and financially Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing on everything from oil to the weather saw how precarious the whole thing was They began pulling out as much money as they could The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and to save face Mr Skilling paid them Then they asked for more Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks Everyone at the top was cashing out while those further down believed the hype We all thrived on the buzz said Mark Lindquist a Web designer who lost his USayear job and is struggling to pay for his autistic sons treatment It seemed like we were part of something incredible He was one of the let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec Now not only the rankandfile are hurting Yesterday Mrs Lay said her family also lost its fortune In an interview with NBCs Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent moral person who like many thousands of others linked to Enron was fighting personal bankruptcy Other than the home we live in everything else is for sale she said We are fighting for liquidity

ENRON Sent Monday December AM To Dorland Chris Subject Read the Part about Chief Money Maker Congress to Probe Enron Downfall AP Online via COMTEX November Enron Corp ENE already jarred by a spiraling stock price a collapsed merger and massive debt will be under the scrutiny of Congress Rep Billy Tauzin RLa chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday announced hearings into Enrons accounting practices and into what impact the companys problems might have on electricity and natural gas markets Were very interested in how the company handled its internal books said Kenneth Johnson a spokesman for the congressman adding that the committees general counsel had been directed to investigate circumstances leading up to the collapse Bankruptcy may be the smartest option for Enron Corp as the oncemighty energy trader tries to extricate itself from a tangled mess of junk credit and massive debt a bankruptcy expert and professor said I would assume it would lead to a sale of the company which was coming anyway said Jay Westbrook a bankruptcy expert who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law Bankruptcy provides a lot of protections that makes it easier to do and it buys time to find out what this companys really worth That was Dynegys problem trying to figure out what the company was worth Analysts predicted bankruptcy was Enrons only option as the humbled company limped into limited operation Thursday to let skittish traders cut ties with it The top executive for Dynegy Inc DYN Enrons smaller rival and wouldbe savior also detailed how Enrons financial decay caused a rescue merger to crumble Stunned employees tried to find hope in the fact that Enron just months ago a towering presence in the energy markets had yet to make a bankruptcy filing EnronOnline the companys Internetbased trading system was up and running on a limited basis for traders to finish transactions and offset credit risk with the company The site which was the first of its kind was shut down for several hours Wednesday after Dynegy Inc called off the merger But analysts said that operation which was Enrons chief money maker needs cash and credit to survive both of which are scarce for the trader Everyone should have at least some skepticism that it could ever emerge from Chapter AG Edwards Sons analyst Mike Heim said Thursday The energy trading business has probably taken such a hit to its reputation that it would be difficult to retrench and go forward Enron officials did not return repeated calls for comment A haggard Chuck Watson chairman and chief executive of Dynegy Inc said a steady stream of revelations of weak finances and decline in Enrons core energy trading business left his company no choice but to walk away This was a very difficult complex unprecedented decay of a company over many months he said at a news conference Thats a shame because a merger could have worked Dynegy announced the rescue plan Nov knowing that Enron posted a million loss in thirdquarter earnings and had ousted its chief financial officer for running partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating But that wasnt all Nov Enron filed paperwork with the SEC that restated its earnings back to eliminating more than million in reported income in that time span The filing also disclosed that Enron would have to pay a million debt within a week Enron got an extension for the debt but its stock resumed a freefall that had halted temporarily with the merger announcement Dynegy started renegotiating Enrons sale price After falling Wednesday shares of Enron were off another cents or percent to finish at cents in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Enrons week high was reached last December at Watson said surprises in the SEC filing caused irreparable damage even as Dynegy continued to hammer away at an agreement When two agencies cut Enrons credit rating to junk status Wednesday triggering an obligation to pay debts of billion or nearly twice the cash the company is believed to have Watson said he had to stop trying to save another company and protect his own Watson said Dynegy invoked an escape clause in the merger agreement that allowed it to back out if Enron had serious financial problems so Dynegy wont have to pay a million breakup fee He also said Dynegy will acquire Enrons Northern Natural Gas pipeline which has miles of pipelines from Texas to the Great Lakes in exchange for the billion partDynegy owner ChevronTexaco pumped into the ailing trader Their pipeline operation is as good as any in the industry Watson said The real question is the wholesale operation and the viability of that and how fast they can come back into the market Enron may challenge that acquisition but Watson said the tradeoff ensured ChevronTexaco wouldnt be out billion That pipeline will be Dynegys Dec he said Rob Doty Dynegys chief financial officer said Friday that because Dynegy is the pipelines preferred stockholder Northern Natural Gas cannot seek bankruptcy protection without Dynegys approval He said the pipeline has been a separate subsidiary of Enron for more than years Dynegy will assume million of Northern Natural Gas debt Doty said

urinal or forcing poop in a stall This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panicembarrassment This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hearit No one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with escapee Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine guns pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover If this should happen do not panic remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy What is with people that article Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours I am pushing for a day work week Why Calgary Why not I love Calgary Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole I think it is a promotion Besides Houston in the arm pit of the world This city has few redeeming features What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty Actually it isnt that bad Houston has good restaurants decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can Kerrie got engaged Good for her I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention I am not engaged I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela No

people that article Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours I am pushing for a day work week Why Calgary Why not I love Calgary Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole I think it is a promotion Besides Houston in the arm pit of the world This city has few redeeming features What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty Actually it isnt that bad Houston has good restaurants decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can Kerrie got engaged Good for her I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention I am not engaged I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela No big loss Too old for me anyway Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY I am going to have to visit some time I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination Or is NY home for a while No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jens wedding this weekend Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary Also I am going to

sober enough to fight Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza but not both Thats just plain mean If you complement a guy on his sixpack youd better be talking about his choice of beer Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of yours except if shes withholding sex pending your response Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting weights a Yeah Baby Push it b Cmon give me one more Harder c Another set and we can hit the showers d Nice Ass Are you a Sagittarius Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing both urinating both waiting in line etc For all other situations an almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are able to have sex with her Keep a stopwatch by the phone Hang up if necessary When a buddy is trying to hook you up you may sabotage him only in a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a massive hangover You may however hide the aspirin smear his chair with limburger cheese turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his monitor is broken and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven minutes The morning after you and a babe who was formerly just a friend have carnal drunken monkey sex the fact that youre feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big mistake it was Always split aces and eights No arguments

beautiful I bet you are looking forward to being all settled Better get back to work Great to hear from you and please send my best to everyone Chris Original Message From Dave Jackie Hewson ENRON mailtoIMC EANOTESDaveJackieHewsonCdjhewsontelusplanetEnetE NRONcom SentSaturday June AM ToDorland Dan Dorland Chris SubjectYou Great Kids Hi Chris Hi Dan Surprise surprise surprise I just wanted to take a minute and express what a fantabulous video it was that ran at the end of your moms show th is year Your parts in it were absolutely wonderful came off beautifull y Was a teary ending to a L O N G show Of course I put Mark on the spot immediately following the show when we saw him and I said OK Mar k the camera is on youwhat great things do you have to say about you r mom He replied Are you serious Youre not serious are you To wh ich I said Yes of course Im serious you should have heard the great things Chris and Dan said about their Mom Well he didnt let me down and then I had a few more tears You guys did a great job with your pa rt of the video and I was proud of you Well we are going through some major changes here as Im sure you know We took possession of our new Red Deer home on June st and the first th ing we did was get Gunner in to install hardwood flooring They just fini shed yesterday and it is awesome Originally there was hardwood in the fr ont entrance way but we had that all refinished to match the new stuff th at we had installed in the family room kitchen and atrium I just love it Today we meet the painter there and choose colours and she will get starte d on Tuesday Well have the whole house painted pretty much and then we can start shuffling our stuff from here to there Its quite overwhelmi ng moving everything from a barn two oversize double garages and this hou se into the city We had all the farm stuff to sell and dispose of and that is pretty much all done now Daves tractor was his pool table fund and it just sold a week or so ago so off to Red Deer Billiards to purchas e the pool table He is having snooker rails put on I guess thats what your folks have too isnt it They tell me its harder to play and that I should get practised up at home and then hit the bars challenge the un suspecting to a game of eight ball and then whoop their butts because Id be so incredibly good after practising on the snooker table Makes me l augh Im pretty positive challenging anyone for a game would be a joke o n my part but hopefully I can get into pool mode and have fun with it t oo The yard at our new home is just incredible compared to most Red Deer yard s The home is on a huge pie shaped lot and has been landscaped beautiful ly so we are quite pleased with that And I LOVE the house Its really very nice and I can hardly wait for the whole move experience to be over and to be settled in there with everything in its place We overspent at Sims and thats going to be fun receiving all that new furniture Andrea Michael and Braedon are doing just fine They purchased a home in Clearview Meadows and its really very nice Has a fenced yard with lots of mature greenery and Braedon just loves his new swing set and sand box Andrea Michael are finding it a real treat to be back in town and reli eves me that Andrea is so much closer to the hospital She usually is wor king evening shifts and I always worried about her travelling the highway so late at night especially in the winter They are expecting baby numbe r and it would appear to be a girl from the ultrasounds shes had so tha t is pretty exciting Miss Jordyn Marie will be her name they havent de cided on a boys name yet in the event that Miss Jordyn Marie has a Mr W iggley but are pondering it Mark of course is a whole other story That boy gives me a few new grey hairs on a regular basis Hes no sooner apart from Nikki and enter Alis on Alison is years old and very very quiet so hard for us to get to know her but she seems quite nice so thats a good thing Not sitting around with a scowl on her face like Nick usually did Mark and Alison ar e in love and are just gaga over each other We are very nice to see h im so happy although worry that it all happened a bit soon But what do we know Mark has been having trouble with his health and Im somewhat c ertain it is stress related however he denies that He experiences such severe chest pains that he actually passes out from the pain This has be en happening more frequently of late and he had to leave the job he was on in Fort St John and return home to try to get healthy before he moves to Cold Lake on July st Thats the other big change Theyve run EKGs or ECGs on him taken blood chest XRays etc and results all came ba ck clear so they are unable to determine what is causing him his problems I guess hes dropped alot of weight and is now underweight for his age and height The Dr has now determined it is a muscle related problem and has him on muscle relaxants and apparently they are helping somewhat so hopefully it will be as easy as that Im sad to see him leaving for Cold Lake again as it is so far away and we wont get to see him much but you guys know all about that He on the other hand is quite excited to get away and get a new start so to speak once again Alison is moving up there with them and they are pretty exc ited to set up their own home Right now Alison is in Australia a trip she has been planning and saving for for quite some time but she is missi ng Mark terribly and trying to come home early We are going to the production Chicago with your mom and dad next weeken d and Im really looking forward to the day Dave and I are planning a tr ip to Toronto Dan just a quick dayer with another couple and I think w eve pretty much decided on August th but tickets havent been pur chased yet We will go see the Lion King and I want to drive out to Niaga ra Falls while were there also Should be fun Hard for us to focus on too much until we get this move completed We have until August st befor e we actually give up possession here on the farm and thank God for all th e time we seem to be needing it and its just flying Well boys I better get off the computer and get back to my packing Will do some packing and then head into town to run some errands before we hav e to meet the painter Take care you two and once again Great job with the video xoxo Jackie
