transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early FERC further acknowleded If transmission providers would all respond to requests for dailyfirm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed This is the correct message for FERC to send back to NERC to put the burd en on the transmission providers to expedite requests not penalize the customers for getting OASIS requests in early Forwarded by Charles YeungHOUECT on PM Grabiak Terri J nerccom on PM Sent by To cc Subject Business Practice Ruling For those of you that havent seen this FERC denied our request T FERC F UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Open Access Sametime Information System OASIS and Standards of Docket No RM Conduct ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR EXPERIMENTAL BUSINESS PRACTICE STANDARD Issued June We will deny the request from the Market Interface Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Council MIC for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for the reasons stated below BACKGROUND On May the MIC filed a request to modify the Commissions OASIS Business Practice Standards adopted in Order No to add a new business practice standard dealing with accepted daily firm pointtopoint transmission service that has not been confirmed and to modify a related footnote to Table on Reservation Timing Limits The MIC requests that the Commission implement this proposal on a mandatory experimental basis for six months beginning no later than June The MIC further states that within four months of the effective date it will provide the Commission with an assessment of the Open Access SameTime Information System and Standards of Conduct Order No FERC Stats Regs Regulations Preambles F Docket No RM experiment and whether it should be revised discontinued or made permanent On June the Commission issued a notice of filing and request for comments regarding the MIC filing The notice gave a brief description of the MIC proposal and invited comments on or before June Comments were invited on the MIC proposal generally and specifically on whether Commission action is needed by June as requested by the MIC On June Dynegy Power Marketing Inc and Coral Power LLC collectively DynegyCoral jointly filed a protest opposing the MIC request DynegyCoral argue that the MIC proposal should not be granted on an expedited basis and that it should be rejected outright DynegyCorals protest was the sole comment filed in response to the June notice and request for comments DISCUSSION We will deny the MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for three reasons First although the MIC requests expedited approval of its proposed experiment the MIC s proposal presents no reason why expedited treatment is needed Moreover although our June notice specifically invited comment on this issue no comments were filed in support of expedited treatment or giving reasons why This shortened comment period was used to accommodate the MICs request for action on or before June Docket No RM prompt action is needed In fact DynegyCoral s protest the sole comment filed argued against expedited approval of the proposed experiment both because it opposed approval of the experiment outright and because DynegyCoral argues that implementation during the summer peak period would cause problems for customers denied service under the MIC s proposal Given the absence of a showing of need for expedited treatment we will reject MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment The MIC proposal would allow transmission providers at reservation request deadlines to retract their prior acceptance of unconfirmed customer requests for daily firm transmission service and substitute pending preconfirmed requests for such service in order of queue time up to the amount of daily firm available transmission capability remaining The proposal includes phrases such as the transmission provider has the right to move to a retracted status and after which time that request may be retracted These phrases do not provide a standard for the transmission provider to use in deciding whether to retract customers unconfirmed accepted requests for daily firm pointtopoint transmission service Careful monitoring would be necessary to insure that the proposal is not implemented in a discriminatory manner A customer whose request for transmission service had been accepted would have no way to predict whether a transmission provider might choose to retract Docket No RM its acceptance which would make it difficult for the customer to make alternative arrangements DynegyCoral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accepted transmission requests but does not address the underlying problem caused by the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early DynegyCoral contends this practice puts customers in a bind that forces them to make alternative arrangements as a protective mechanism DynegyCoral argues that customers should not be punished for taking such precautions even if they result in some unused transmission capacity DynegyCoral argues that a better solution to avoid unused capacity would be for transmission providers to more uniformly respond to requests for daily firm transmission service on a timely basis rather than by taking the unwarranted step of giving greater priority to preconfirmed service requests Further DynegyCoral argues that the MIC proposal would force customers to purchase transmission services they will be unable to use We agree with DynegyCoral that the MIC proposal does not address whether the time period for transmission providers to evaluate requests for daily firm transmission service needs to be clarified or shortened and that this is a relevant issue If transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily Docket No RM firm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed We request that the MIC reconsider its motion in light of the concerns raised by DynegyCoral After considering these issues the MIC may at its option make a revised request for an experimental business practice standard The Commission orders The request by MIC for expedited approval of a proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service is hereby denied without prejudice as discussed in the body of this

with Duke NA the IPP side formerly with EEI I need some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his question Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority Or does it allow for any organization ie GISBEISB to perform the functions I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow down market formation but we certainly dont want to have to deal with every RTO as a reliability standard setting organization Forwarded by Charles YeungHOUECT on PM Michael F Gildea on PM To cc Subject Re NERC Issues Charles I believe we need a conference call with yourself Lydia and few others to assess the landscape come to a common position and goal here I believe the ugly train has left the station and we are in damage control at the moment Optimally we need the three of us on the same page when we go to the TCCG meeting in Tampa from there we can try to spread our common message On another front the reliability legislation I told our DC office not that they will listen that the legisation NERC is pushing on the Capitol Hill is now outdated and puts too much emphasis for standards in NERC hands when the game today is inthe RTOs A powerful NERC may slow up market development What is the view of Enron here I assume the same but curious Apparently some Hill Staffers called our DC office for opinions on the NERC reliability legislation so something afoot Micheal CharlesYeung enroncom To cc bcc PM Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Forwarded by Charles YeungHOUECT on PM Charles CT PM To ENRON cc ENRON ENRON ENRON Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Document link Charles Yeung I want to forward this to TCCG as agneda items for the Tampa meeting on AM To cc Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles and Mike At yesterdays Security Subcommittee meeting a motion passed to change SMEPA control area configuration in the IDC to reflect the location of their share of generation in Entergys territory that is needed to serve their load The way the IDC was working was giving erroneous information about an overload on the WeberRichard line which in fact was not happening I tried to prevent this change for occurring stating that policy allows for the security coordinators to adjust the cut list when known errors are occurring We need to have a definite action plan for how and when increased granularity will be allowed to happen Lanny Nickell is suppose to make a presentation at the next MIC meeting about this But we all need to be on the same page to have an action plan in place that we can start shopping to MIC members I have volunteered to head a group to try to define the end state of total granularity that we would ultimately want for the IDC and the asociated costs to get there Another important issue that we need to address head on is the desire of the SCs to allow for lowering of the impact thresholds for certain flowgates that are now not getting relief at I asked if this motion was passed would it guarantee that less MWs will be cut in order to get the relief needed the answer was no Therefore why should we support any change This entire issue centers around a fundamental issue that has existed from day one when flowgates were first allowed what are the standards for allowing new flowgates To what extent should local problems be addressed by the transmission provider with those problems versus putting the pain on the entire market place because the TP cant or wont improve their transmission facility In the first days of TLR I raised this issue over and over again when MAIN used a kV line as a proxy for the Albion Transformer which caused about sourcesink pairs to be cut throughout the eastern interconnection This is an issue that ultimately will be handled by the RTOs but education is the key here as flowgates are being defined around the country Another issue is OSL determination Ben Li has prepared Appendix CA There was discussion at the meeting that implementing this would further restrict transmission access The SCs are all over the board on this I reminded them that the MIC had asked for data for each flowgate now in existence for TLR purposes to define for us how they determine their own limits I was told at this meeting it was never done because there was no agreement on how to measure the OSL So how I asked can a OSL be determined via of a NERC standard I have real heartburn that NERC does not have any measurable standards for allowing the items discussed above We have to force criteria and measurable standards Let me know what you think Also what we need to do to flesh out these issues so everyone can understand them Lydia Vollmer Exelon Power Team Exelon Way Kennett Square PA RichardIngersoll enroncom To cc AM Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles I agree with you buti think we need to resist increased granularity at this time It will only decrease transmission and increase TLRs Also the increase in transmission segments will make it more dificult to put a transaction together Charles Yeung To AM ENRON cc ENRON ENR ON EN RON ENRO N bill rust Subject Re when the LCA is not the SinkLink This sounds like a tagging problem and not an IDC granularity problem Yes this can be fixed with a IDC granularity change but does NERC want to change IDC granualaruty on a piecemeal basis for this and the othe control areas What abot when these control areas change to another control area service provider What about the next I dont think that AEPs customers actually disconnected from the AEP grid and reconnected at some other point in another control areas transmission network The IDC is not mapping flows for that customer any more wrongly than when that customer purchased control area services from AEP This is why hard criteria is needed to verify whether these situations require granularity change or whether ALL existing control areas need more granularity for that matter Sent by To cc Subject when the LCA is not the Sink We have been informed by one of our customers who serves a load which has been electronically removed from the AEP Control Area that from now on they will use the Electronic Control Area as the LCA instead of using the Physical Control Area AEP as the LCA In this way the Electronic Control Area will be properly notified of any adjustments and approvals regarding this transaction Unfortunately the IDC will be mapping the flow into one CA while its really going to another Our representative to the SSC will be arguing strenuously at their next meeting that these types of situations need to be addressed Historically the creation of a new control area has been the answer Lou has indicated that there are of these situations pending in the Eastern Interconnect

The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere In addition the report cautions that New England New York City and Texas should be closely watched despite having adequate resources to meet demand New England and New York City are particularly sensitive to longterm heat waves and higherthanexpected generating unit forced outages Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area operations into one The report concludes that generating capacity resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in other areas of North America this summer The assessment also points to concerns regarding northtosouth transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United States particularly east of the Mississippi River The ability to transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern Interconnection was severely tested last summer spurred by cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south as well as high fuel prices in the south Early indications are that key transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south are already fully subscribed going into this summer and that transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout the summer As a supplement to its Summer Assessment report NERC also published a Summer Special Assessment This document is an indepth independent examination of the expected summer conditions in both California and the Pacific Northwest and is based on interviews with experts from both the California Independent System Operator CAISO and the Northwest Power Pool NWPP NERCs CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC the CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand rotating blackouts are expected NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater than those expected by the CAISO NERC anticipates that firm demand may be curtailed for about hours over the course of this summer with an average firm demand curtailment of about MW NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to serve all their firm electricity demands this summer However NWPP will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst water years on record The independent reports prepared by NERCs Reliability Assessment Subcommittee assess the projected demand and the resources available to meet that demand this summer as well as transmission reliability issues The reports are posted on NERCs web site at wwwnerccom The web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into NAERO and the electric industrys electricity supply and delivery programs and activities NERC is a notforprofit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to keep the lights on by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United

signatory t o the joint CoralDynegy protest I worked with Dynegy on forming the argumen ts against the proposed change to OASIS first to confirm after scheduling deadline at NERC Dynegy and Enron and a few others voted against the NE RC request but lost the vote thus leading to the NERC filing In my opinion such a practice would advantage incumbent utilities and their affiliate marketers who tend to buy preconfirmed Firm service One of the main arguments I made at NERC and a chief reason why FERC denied the request is cited in the order DynegyCoral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accept ed transmission requests but does not address the underlying problem caused b y the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early FERC further acknowleded If transmission providers would all respond to requests for dailyfirm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed This is the correct message for FERC to send back to NERC to put the burd en on the transmission providers to expedite requests not penalize the customers for getting OASIS requests in early Forwarded by Charles YeungHOUECT on PM Grabiak Terri J nerccom on PM Sent by To cc Subject Business Practice Ruling For those of you that havent seen this FERC denied our request T FERC F UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Open Access Sametime Information System OASIS and Standards of Docket No RM Conduct ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR EXPERIMENTAL BUSINESS PRACTICE STANDARD Issued June We will deny the request from the Market Interface Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Council MIC for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for the reasons stated below BACKGROUND On May the MIC filed a request to modify the Commissions OASIS Business Practice Standards adopted in Order No to add a new business practice standard dealing with accepted daily firm pointtopoint transmission service that has not been confirmed and to modify a related footnote to Table on Reservation Timing Limits The MIC requests that the Commission implement this proposal on a mandatory experimental basis for six months beginning no later than June The MIC further states that within four months of the effective date it will provide the Commission with an assessment of the Open Access SameTime Information System and Standards of Conduct Order No FERC Stats Regs Regulations Preambles F Docket No RM experiment and whether it should be revised discontinued or made permanent On June the Commission issued a notice of filing and request for comments regarding the MIC filing The notice gave a brief description of the MIC proposal and invited comments on or before June Comments were invited on the MIC proposal generally and specifically on whether Commission action is needed by June as requested by the MIC On June Dynegy Power Marketing Inc and Coral Power LLC collectively DynegyCoral jointly filed a protest opposing the MIC request DynegyCoral argue that the MIC proposal should not be granted on an expedited basis and that it should be rejected outright DynegyCorals protest was the sole comment filed in response to the June notice and request for comments DISCUSSION We will deny the MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for three reasons First although the MIC requests expedited approval of its proposed experiment the MIC s proposal presents no reason why expedited treatment is needed Moreover although our June notice specifically invited comment on this issue no comments were filed in support of expedited treatment or giving reasons why This shortened comment period was used to accommodate the MICs request for action on or before June Docket No RM prompt action is needed In fact DynegyCoral s protest the sole comment filed argued against expedited approval of the proposed experiment both because it opposed approval of the experiment outright and because DynegyCoral argues that implementation during the summer peak period would cause problems for customers denied service under the MIC s proposal Given the absence of a showing of need for expedited treatment we will reject MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment The MIC proposal would allow transmission providers at reservation request deadlines to retract their prior acceptance of unconfirmed customer requests for daily firm transmission service and substitute pending preconfirmed requests for such service in order of queue time up to the amount of daily firm available transmission capability remaining The proposal includes phrases such as the transmission provider has the right to move to a retracted status and after which time that request may be retracted These phrases do not provide a standard for the transmission provider to use in deciding whether to retract customers unconfirmed accepted requests for daily firm pointtopoint transmission service Careful monitoring would be necessary to insure that the proposal is not implemented in a discriminatory manner A customer whose request for transmission service had been accepted would have no way to predict whether a transmission provider might choose to retract Docket No RM its acceptance which would make it difficult for the customer to make alternative arrangements DynegyCoral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accepted transmission requests but does not address the underlying problem caused by the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early DynegyCoral contends this practice puts customers in a bind that forces them to make alternative arrangements as a protective mechanism DynegyCoral argues that customers should not be punished for taking such precautions even if they result in some unused transmission capacity DynegyCoral argues that a better solution to avoid unused capacity would be for transmission providers to more uniformly respond to requests for daily firm transmission service on a timely basis rather than by taking the unwarranted step of giving greater priority to preconfirmed service requests Further DynegyCoral argues that the MIC proposal would force customers to purchase transmission services they will be unable to use We agree with DynegyCoral that the MIC proposal does not address whether the time period for transmission providers to evaluate requests for daily firm transmission service needs to be clarified or shortened and that this is a relevant issue If transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily Docket No RM firm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed We request that the MIC reconsider its motion in light of the concerns raised by DynegyCoral After considering these issues the MIC may at its option make a revised request for an experimental business practice standard The Commission orders The request by MIC for expedited approval of a proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service is hereby denied without prejudice as discussed in the body of this

is with Duke NA the IPP side formerly with EEI I need some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his question Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority Or does it allow for any organization ie GISBEISB to perform the functions I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow down market formation but we certainly

the moment Optimally we need the three of us on the same page when we go to the TCCG meeting in Tampa from there we can try to spread our common message On another front the reliability legislation I told our DC office not that they will listen that the legisation NERC is pushing on the Capitol Hill is now outdated and puts too much emphasis for standards in NERC hands when the game today is inthe RTOs A powerful NERC may slow up market development What is the view of Enron here I assume the same but curious Apparently some Hill Staffers called our DC office for opinions on the NERC reliability

Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Document link Charles Yeung I want to forward this to TCCG as agneda items for the Tampa meeting on AM To cc Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles and Mike At yesterdays Security Subcommittee meeting a motion passed to change SMEPA control area configuration in the IDC to reflect the location of their share of generation in Entergys territory that is needed to serve their load The way the IDC was working was giving erroneous information about an overload on the WeberRichard line which in fact was not happening I tried to prevent this change for occurring stating that policy allows for the security coordinators to adjust the cut list when known errors are occurring We need to have a definite action plan for how and when increased granularity will be allowed to happen Lanny Nickell is suppose to make a presentation at the next MIC meeting about this But we all need to be on the same page to have an action plan in place that we can start shopping to MIC members I have volunteered to head a group to try to define the end state of total granularity that we would ultimately want for the IDC and the asociated costs to get there Another important issue that we need to address head on is the desire of the SCs to allow for lowering of the impact thresholds for certain flowgates that are now not getting relief at I asked if this motion was passed would it guarantee that less MWs will be cut in order to get the relief needed the answer was no Therefore why should we support any change This entire issue centers around a fundamental issue that has existed from day one when flowgates were first allowed what are the standards for allowing new flowgates To what extent should local problems be addressed by the transmission provider with those problems versus putting the pain on the entire market place because the TP cant or wont improve their transmission facility In the first days of TLR I raised this issue over and over again when MAIN used a kV line as a proxy for the Albion Transformer which caused about sourcesink pairs to be cut throughout the eastern interconnection This is an issue that ultimately will be handled by the RTOs but education is the key here as flowgates are being defined around the country Another issue is OSL determination Ben Li has prepared Appendix CA There was discussion at the meeting that implementing this would further restrict transmission access The SCs are all over the board on this I reminded them that the MIC had asked for data for each flowgate now in existence for TLR purposes to define for us how they determine their own limits I was told at this meeting it was never done because there was no agreement on how to measure the OSL So how I asked can a OSL be determined via of a NERC standard I have real heartburn that NERC does not have any measurable standards for allowing the items discussed above We have to force criteria and measurable standards Let me know what you think Also what we need to do to flesh out these issues so everyone can understand them Lydia Vollmer Exelon Power Team Exelon Way Kennett Square PA RichardIngersoll enroncom To cc AM Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles I agree with you buti think we need to resist increased granularity at this time It will only decrease transmission and increase TLRs Also the increase in transmission segments will make it more dificult to put a transaction together Charles Yeung To AM ENRON cc ENRON ENR ON EN RON ENRO N bill rust Subject Re when the LCA is not the SinkLink This sounds like a tagging problem and not an IDC granularity problem Yes this can be fixed with a IDC granularity change but does NERC want to change IDC granualaruty on a piecemeal basis for this and the othe control areas What abot when these control areas change to another control area service provider What about the next I dont think that AEPs customers actually disconnected from the AEP grid and reconnected at some other point in another control areas transmission network The IDC is not mapping flows for that customer any more wrongly than when that customer purchased control area services from AEP This is why hard criteria is needed to verify whether these situations require granularity change or whether ALL existing control areas need more granularity for that matter Sent by To cc Subject when the LCA is not the Sink We have been informed by one of our customers who serves a load which has been electronically removed from the AEP Control Area that from now on they will use the Electronic Control Area as the LCA instead of using the Physical Control Area AEP as the LCA In this way the Electronic Control Area will be properly notified of any adjustments and approvals regarding this transaction Unfortunately the IDC will be mapping the flow into one CA while its really going to another Our representative to the SSC will be arguing strenuously at their next meeting that these types of situations need to be addressed Historically the creation of a new control area has been the answer Lou has indicated that there are of these situations pending in the Eastern Interconnect

The report also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere In addition the report cautions that New England New York City and Texas should be closely watched despite having adequate resources to meet demand New England and New York City are particularly sensitive to longterm heat waves and higherthanexpected generating unit forced outages Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area operations into one The report concludes that generating capacity resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in other areas of North America this summer The assessment also points to concerns regarding northtosouth transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United States particularly east of the Mississippi River The ability to transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern Interconnection was severely tested last summer spurred by cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south as well as high fuel prices in the south Early indications are that key transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south are already fully subscribed going into this summer and that transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout the summer As a supplement to its Summer Assessment report NERC also published a Summer Special Assessment This document is an indepth independent examination of the expected summer conditions in both California and the Pacific Northwest and is based on interviews with experts from both the California Independent System Operator CAISO and the Northwest Power Pool NWPP NERCs CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC the CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand rotating blackouts are expected NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater than those expected by the CAISO NERC anticipates that firm demand may be curtailed for about hours over the course of this summer with an average firm demand curtailment of about MW NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to serve all their firm electricity demands this summer However NWPP will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst water years on record The independent reports prepared by NERCs Reliability Assessment Subcommittee assess the projected demand and the

were that more transmission capacity was needed AEP noted that flow on some bulk transmission paths is up to over what it was in the old days Nothing specific was discussed about how to address this other than to have early and comprehensive coordination among interested parties so that investments could be made There was also some concern about new generation interconnection and how those costs should be covered AEP did not like the current system where they conclude that the system pays all costs of interconnection when generators receive all of the benefit It was questioned whether or not the system didnt receive a benefit as well but AEP countered that the current approach does not give any incentive to generation to locate appropriately and that in the end benefits go to the generator out of proportion to the cost imposed on them It will be interesting to see if Walter et al encounter the same issues or completely different ones Martin Original Message From Walton Steve

observe what people were saying For those who are interested I summarize below While this workshop was done via video conference the remaining workshops will be facetoface affair Peter Dreyfuss director of the Chicago regional office of the DOE hosted speakers from the Michigan Public Service Commission Chairman Chapelle and the Ohio PUC Nonspeakers in attendance were from DTE Energy EPRI and the USDA Via video conference were DOE participantsconsultants from DC ORNL LBL and the University of Illinois as well as speakers from National Grid and AEP Transcriptstestimony should be available on the NTGS website by next week Most of the discussion I heard focused on permitting There was general reluctance to have federal intervention The Ohio PUC promoted their legislation which coordinates the various overlapping jurisdictions and empowers bodies to hold hearings etc with regulators from other states AEP suggested federal involvement after a or month time trigger has passed Some questions addressed incentives for expansion and development of merchant transmission but most answers were general and vague AEP declined to provide specifics but promised to address the topic

from the issues summary that references NERC that I am concerned with I personally am unable to attend any of the workshops due to meeting conflicts but wish those who will attend to be aware of Enrons position about NERC as a reliability standards setting organization Richard Ingesrsoll I believe we have enough coverage and you need not attend thank you EXCERPT FROM THE DOE WEBSITE Reliability Management and Oversight Institutional structures for assuring reliability The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC is evolving from a bottomup industrydominated volunteer organization into the North American Electric Reliability Organization NAERO which may be overseen by an independent board NAERO proposes to set and enforces mandatory standards and have regional reliability councils report to it rather than vice versa Some suggest that reliability administration should be vested in NAERO Others advocate for regional reliability authorities that are free to establish standards that focus on regional conditions The requirements of reliability management and oversight must be delineated in order to assess the extent to which alternative institutional structures can meet these requirements Return to the National Transmission Grid Study website ntgs Summary of Enron Concerns with NERCNAERO NERC is being challenged by many transmission customers as to its capability to continue be the indsutrys reliability standards setting organization Enron as do many other customers believes that any standards setting organization must recognize the commercial impacts of a reliability standard The definition of reliability is inextricably tied to commercial impacts in some form For example even a standard for system frequency at Hz contains economic factors when an operator establishes a procedure to maintain frequency in the name of reliability Therefore Enron does not support NERC proceeding as a reliabilty only organization Enron has been supportive of the GISB efforts to establish an Energy Industry Standards Board that will contain no artificial boundaries of commercial or reliability as to its scope of standards regarding the wholesale electric quadrant In short Enron should make clear that the existing NERC and NAERO organziation and its approach to setting reliabilty standards ignores the marketcommercial impacts relegating the market concerns as second class citizens in their process Please forward this to any other Enron persons who plan to attend these workshops and contact me if you have any questions

is with Duke NA the IPP side formerly with EEI I need some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his question Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority Or does it allow for any organization ie GISBEISB to perform the functions I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow down market formation but we certainly

need a conference call with yourself Lydia and few others to assess the landscape come to a common position and goal here I believe the ugly train has left the station and we are in damage control at the moment Optimally we need the three of us on the same page when we go to the TCCG meeting in Tampa from there we can try to spread our common message On another front the reliability legislation I told our DC office not that they will listen that the legisation NERC is pushing on the Capitol Hill is now outdated and puts too much emphasis for standards in NERC hands when the game today is inthe RTOs A powerful NERC may slow up market development What is the view of Enron here I assume the same but curious Apparently some Hill Staffers called our DC office for opinions on the NERC reliability

Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Document link Charles Yeung I want to forward this to TCCG as agneda items for the Tampa meeting on AM To cc Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles and Mike At yesterdays Security Subcommittee meeting a motion passed to change SMEPA control area configuration in the IDC to reflect the location of their share of generation in Entergys territory that is needed to serve their load The way the IDC was working was giving erroneous information about an overload on the WeberRichard line which in fact was not happening I tried to prevent this change for occurring stating that policy allows for the security coordinators to adjust the cut list when known errors are occurring We need to have a definite action plan for how and when increased granularity will be allowed to happen Lanny Nickell is suppose to make a presentation at the next MIC meeting about this But we all need to be on the same page to have an action plan in place that we can start shopping to MIC members I have volunteered to head a group to try to define the end state of total granularity that we would ultimately want for the IDC and the asociated costs to get there Another important issue that we need to address head on is the desire of the SCs to allow for lowering of the impact thresholds for certain flowgates that are now not getting relief at I asked if this motion was passed would it guarantee that less MWs will be cut in order to get the relief needed the answer was no Therefore why should we support any change This entire issue centers around a fundamental issue that has existed from day one when flowgates were first allowed what are the standards for allowing new flowgates To what extent should local problems be addressed by the transmission provider with those problems versus putting the pain on the entire market place because the TP cant or wont improve their transmission facility In the first days of TLR I raised this issue over and over again when MAIN used a kV line as a proxy for the Albion Transformer which caused about sourcesink pairs to be cut throughout the eastern interconnection This is an issue that ultimately will be handled by the RTOs but education is the key here as flowgates are being defined around the country Another issue is OSL determination Ben Li has prepared Appendix CA There was discussion at the meeting that implementing this would further restrict transmission access The SCs are all over the board on this I reminded them that the MIC had asked for data for each flowgate now in existence for TLR purposes to define for us how they determine their own limits I was told at this meeting it was never done because there was no agreement on how to measure the OSL So how I asked can a OSL be determined via of a NERC standard I have real heartburn that NERC does not have any measurable standards for allowing the items discussed above We have to force criteria and measurable standards Let me know what you think Also what we need to do to flesh out these issues so everyone can understand them Lydia Vollmer Exelon Power Team Exelon Way Kennett Square PA RichardIngersoll enroncom To cc AM Subject Re when the LCA is not the Sink Charles I agree with you buti think we need to resist increased granularity at this time It will only decrease transmission and increase TLRs Also the increase in transmission segments will make it more dificult to put a transaction together Charles Yeung To AM ENRON cc ENRON ENR ON EN RON ENRO N bill rust Subject Re when the LCA is not the SinkLink This sounds like a tagging problem and not an IDC granularity problem Yes this can be fixed with a IDC granularity change but does NERC want to change IDC granualaruty on a piecemeal basis for this and the othe control areas What abot when these control areas change to another control area service provider What about the next I dont think that AEPs customers actually disconnected from the AEP grid and reconnected at some other point in another control areas transmission network The IDC is not mapping flows for that customer any more wrongly than when that customer purchased control area services from AEP This is why hard criteria is needed to verify whether these situations require granularity change or whether ALL existing control areas need more granularity for that matter Sent by To cc Subject when the LCA is not the Sink We have been informed by one of our customers who serves a load which has been electronically removed from the AEP Control Area that from now on they will use the Electronic Control Area as the LCA instead of using the Physical Control Area AEP as the LCA In this way the Electronic Control Area will be properly notified of any adjustments and approvals regarding this transaction Unfortunately the IDC will be mapping the flow into one CA while its really going to another Our representative to the SSC will be arguing strenuously at their next meeting that these types of situations need to be addressed Historically the creation of a new control area has been the answer Lou has indicated that there are of these situations pending in the Eastern Interconnect

output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere For your convenience a copy of the press release announcing the Summer Assessment is shown below In addition this press release as well as the subject reports are

Assessment The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC released its Summer Assessment today The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties meeting its projected

also states that extreme drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the available output of hydroelectric resources We expect that utilities in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands this summer he added but they will not have electricity available to export to California and elsewhere In addition the report cautions that New England New York City and Texas should be closely watched despite having adequate resources to meet demand New England and New York City are particularly sensitive to longterm heat waves and higherthanexpected generating unit forced outages Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area operations into one The report concludes that generating capacity resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in other areas of North America this summer The assessment also points to concerns regarding northtosouth transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United States particularly east of the Mississippi River The ability to transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern Interconnection was severely tested last summer spurred by cool temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south as well as high fuel prices in the south Early indications are that key transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south are already fully subscribed going into this summer and that transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout the summer As a supplement to its Summer Assessment report NERC also published a Summer Special Assessment This document is an indepth independent examination of the expected summer conditions in both California and the Pacific Northwest and is based on interviews with experts from both the California Independent System Operator CAISO and the Northwest Power Pool NWPP NERCs CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC the CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand rotating blackouts are expected NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater than those expected by the CAISO NERC anticipates that firm demand may be curtailed for about hours over the course of this summer with an average firm demand curtailment of about MW NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to serve all their firm electricity demands this summer However NWPP will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst water years on record The independent reports prepared by NERCs Reliability Assessment Subcommittee assess the projected demand and the resources available to meet that demand this summer as well as transmission reliability issues The reports are posted on NERCs web site at wwwnerccom The web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into NAERO and the electric industrys electricity supply and delivery programs and activities NERC is a notforprofit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to keep the lights on by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United

Commission Cc Its my turn sorry I havent jumped in til now computer problems At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat do wn and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would tackle the tough issues at NERC I beleive the EPSA folks in the room Mirant Dynegy Ontario Power Gen En ron Exelon Calpine and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organizat ion setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability and commercial issues can be sleanly separated We came away from the mee ting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mech anism to resolve this age old debate I dont care what kind of standard y ou call it if you write it it must be put through the GISBEISB wringer GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given a segment in the energy quadrant Also to respond to Sarahs note about support for an SRO no entity in the room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization no t NERC NAERO GISB or RTOs So I think we need to hold tight to this issu e and we will be able to rally support for it I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed Aug at DOE I am working with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants from the EISB Strawman I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I will make on behalf of EPSA Please proviede me your thoughts Also I agree with Dick today NERC is million dollars annually and mostly utility dollars If we are going to push for a EISB we have to pr ovide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this NERC and their supporters will fall on their sword on funding and the reult wil l be we have organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to beco me a part of the EISB process And one more thing I dont know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he has to the Independent Baord members many of which he helped get seated But

Novosel Sarah Nic olay Christi L Scott Susan SubjectRE FTC NERC Comment of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics and of Policy Planning of the Federal Trade Commission After reading the FTC document I am concerned that we are loosing sight of the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser vice It will decide who uses the system how it will be used what schedu les will be accepted etc Do we really want it to set the standards by it s performance is to be judged by others There are two tendencies to guard against Most of these organizations are going to be notforprofit ISOs in form There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim ize outage risk and criticism of the RTOs management This could require the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary The opposite possiblity exists namely that they will adjust rules to cove r their own mistakes I think the former problem is the most likely If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested then the reliability rule s would have to become part of the FERC tariff In order to judge the vali dity of the reliability provisions of the tariffs the FERC will be requir ed to develop expertise it does not have In practice NERC doesnt have th e expertise either It really resides in the members of the committees and is thus derived from the industry By having a separate Standards Setting Organization the rules can still be established using the expertise of th e industry The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to complaint The SSOs governance has to be fair but I am not personally c oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight It is the service provider the RTO that needs to be independent The standards in most industries are set in this way The power of the state to enforce th e rules come from commissions of various types For instance the National Electric Code is developed by the industry but its enforcement is accompl ished by adopting it into building codes state liscensing requirements et c In the same way the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in corporated in FERCs requirement imposed on the RTO The RTOs tariff woul d incorporate them by reference If the RTOs performance violates the rule s or if a generator doesnt hold up its requirements then ADRFERC action can be taken to enforce My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service It should n ot see itself as a regulator The case of the CAISO is instructive since they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are the guardians of the public interest When the service provider thinks it regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who should have tr ansmission service rather than get on with providing it Steve Original Message From Perrino Dave SentTuesday August PM ToYeung Charles Shapiro Richard Steffes James D

Version of Legislation Rick The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NER C activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly EN RONNERC team conference call John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length o f its proposed Title on Reliability so as to look more like the PJM appro ach Fundamentally there are still major differences NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the SRO in the legislatio n Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson Dave Cook a nd Jeff Skilling we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug by NE RC stakeholders to finalize the NERC version would impact Jeffs request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of de ference to NERC to become the SRO or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization SSO The meeting on the th should not interfere with Jeffs ability to pr esent issues to the Board We dont think Jeff needs to contact John Q And erson or any NERC members about the Aug meeting However for the discus sions with NERC John Shelk plans to stay the line on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items and if Enron is appeased deference to NERC could still be given but not throug h legislation rather through FERC comfort that the SSO is doing a good j ob By knowing that FERC can pull the plug on the SSO if it is not satis fied this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to re solveaddress for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board Additionally Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC in its current form is not able to develop consensus rules t hat all its members are willing to comply with These examples should be p owerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authorit y in the legislation We also discussed the need to shop our reliability

signatory t o the joint CoralDynegy protest I worked with Dynegy on forming the argumen ts against the proposed change to OASIS first to confirm after scheduling deadline at NERC Dynegy and Enron and a few others voted against the NE RC request but lost the vote thus leading to the NERC filing In my opinion such a practice would advantage incumbent utilities and their affiliate marketers who tend to buy preconfirmed Firm service One of the main arguments I made at NERC and a chief reason why FERC denied the request is cited in the order DynegyCoral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accept ed transmission requests but does not address the underlying problem caused b y the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early FERC further acknowleded If transmission providers would all respond to requests for dailyfirm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed This is the correct message for FERC to send back to NERC to put the burd en on the transmission providers to expedite requests not penalize the customers for getting OASIS requests in early Forwarded by Charles YeungHOUECT on PM Grabiak Terri J nerccom on PM Sent by To cc Subject Business Practice Ruling For those of you that havent seen this FERC denied our request T FERC F UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Open Access Sametime Information System OASIS and Standards of Docket No RM Conduct ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR EXPERIMENTAL BUSINESS PRACTICE STANDARD Issued June We will deny the request from the Market Interface Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Council MIC for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for the reasons stated below BACKGROUND On May the MIC filed a request to modify the Commissions OASIS Business Practice Standards adopted in Order No to add a new business practice standard dealing with accepted daily firm pointtopoint transmission service that has not been confirmed and to modify a related footnote to Table on Reservation Timing Limits The MIC requests that the Commission implement this proposal on a mandatory experimental basis for six months beginning no later than June The MIC further states that within four months of the effective date it will provide the Commission with an assessment of the Open Access SameTime Information System and Standards of Conduct Order No FERC Stats Regs Regulations Preambles F Docket No RM experiment and whether it should be revised discontinued or made permanent On June the Commission issued a notice of filing and request for comments regarding the MIC filing The notice gave a brief description of the MIC proposal and invited comments on or before June Comments were invited on the MIC proposal generally and specifically on whether Commission action is needed by June as requested by the MIC On June Dynegy Power Marketing Inc and Coral Power LLC collectively DynegyCoral jointly filed a protest opposing the MIC request DynegyCoral argue that the MIC proposal should not be granted on an expedited basis and that it should be rejected outright DynegyCorals protest was the sole comment filed in response to the June notice and request for comments DISCUSSION We will deny the MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service for three reasons First although the MIC requests expedited approval of its proposed experiment the MIC s proposal presents no reason why expedited treatment is needed Moreover although our June notice specifically invited comment on this issue no comments were filed in support of expedited treatment or giving reasons why This shortened comment period was used to accommodate the MICs request for action on or before June Docket No RM prompt action is needed In fact DynegyCoral s protest the sole comment filed argued against expedited approval of the proposed experiment both because it opposed approval of the experiment outright and because DynegyCoral argues that implementation during the summer peak period would cause problems for customers denied service under the MIC s proposal Given the absence of a showing of need for expedited treatment we will reject MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed experiment The MIC proposal would allow transmission providers at reservation request deadlines to retract their prior acceptance of unconfirmed customer requests for daily firm transmission service and substitute pending preconfirmed requests for such service in order of queue time up to the amount of daily firm available transmission capability remaining The proposal includes phrases such as the transmission provider has the right to move to a retracted status and after which time that request may be retracted These phrases do not provide a standard for the transmission provider to use in deciding whether to retract customers unconfirmed accepted requests for daily firm pointtopoint transmission service Careful monitoring would be necessary to insure that the proposal is not implemented in a discriminatory manner A customer whose request for transmission service had been accepted would have no way to predict whether a transmission provider might choose to retract Docket No RM its acceptance which would make it difficult for the customer to make alternative arrangements DynegyCoral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accepted transmission requests but does not address the underlying problem caused by the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests for daily firm transmission service even when customers submit their requests early DynegyCoral contends this practice puts customers in a bind that forces them to make alternative arrangements as a protective mechanism DynegyCoral argues that customers should not be punished for taking such precautions even if they result in some unused transmission capacity DynegyCoral argues that a better solution to avoid unused capacity would be for transmission providers to more uniformly respond to requests for daily firm transmission service on a timely basis rather than by taking the unwarranted step of giving greater priority to preconfirmed service requests Further DynegyCoral argues that the MIC proposal would force customers to purchase transmission services they will be unable to use We agree with DynegyCoral that the MIC proposal does not address whether the time period for transmission providers to evaluate requests for daily firm transmission service needs to be clarified or shortened and that this is a relevant issue If transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily Docket No RM firm transmission service on a timely basis then customers would have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled and the MICs proposed business practice might not be needed We request that the MIC reconsider its motion in light of the concerns raised by DynegyCoral After considering these issues the MIC may at its option make a revised request for an experimental business practice standard The Commission orders The request by MIC for expedited approval of a proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for daily firm transmission service is hereby denied without prejudice as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission S E A L David P Boergers Secretary Terri J Grabiak General Manager Transmission Marketing Allegheny Power Cabin Hill Drive Room B Greensburg PA fax mailto mailto

the process in place to address the conflict If there is n o process available then we should know what our next step should be In the complaint we should point out that the ERCOT interpretation to not p ay OOME causes the wrong economic incentives I would think that John Adam s interpretation is not economically motivated but operationsreliability related I am not familiar with the logic of his interpretation but we s hould try to point out why his interpretation is not just inapprorpriate fo r the economics but also unnecessary for operations and reliability Dougs suggestion about the RMR

CcGilbertsmith Doug Baughman Edward D Miller Jeffrey Forney Jo hn M SubjectErcot Questions OOMC OOME Forwarded as discussed Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant and sidesteps the obligation to pa y an OOME price component when the plants output is utilized by ERCOT Th e OOMC compensation is currently negligible and recovery of actual costs u nder Protocols Sec may take a long time and the OOME compensa tion has various problems as well the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME the the lesser the OOME price paid Protocols Sec Heat Ra te value decreases and plants directed to provide say MWs of OOM COOME are not allowed to generate above MWs in an interval thus runn ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate to sell the excess in the marketplace The Frontera plant a customer of EPMI acting as QSE is locat ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS E to provide OOMC to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh ould be Reliability Must Run RMR and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system reliability I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols conducted under Protocols Section and we would appreciate any reg group efforts toward preparation for iinit iating such dispute Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom orrow even if ERCOT tells us their QSE that it should be dispatched Thus we are caught in the middle The legitimate bases for not complying with a n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section thr eat to safety risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr oducts that it is generating capacity available but not energy delivered t o the grid I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC The Operating Gui des definition of OOMC page seems to recognize this however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney

Commission Cc Its my turn sorry I havent jumped in til now computer problems At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat do wn and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would tackle the tough issues at NERC I beleive the EPSA folks in the room Mirant Dynegy Ontario Power Gen En ron Exelon Calpine and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organizat ion setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability and commercial issues can be sleanly separated We came away from the mee ting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mech anism to resolve this age old debate I dont care what kind of standard y ou call it if you write it it must be put through the GISBEISB wringer GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given a segment in the energy quadrant Also to respond to Sarahs note about support for an SRO no entity in the room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization no t NERC NAERO GISB or RTOs So I think we need to hold tight to this issu e and we will be able to rally support for it I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed Aug at DOE I am working with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants from the EISB Strawman I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I will make on behalf of EPSA Please proviede me your thoughts Also I agree with Dick today NERC is million dollars annually and mostly utility dollars If we are going to push for a EISB we have to pr ovide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this NERC and their supporters will fall on their sword on funding and the reult wil l be we have organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to beco me a part of the EISB process And one more thing I dont know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he has to the Independent Baord members many of which he helped get seated But

Novosel Sarah Nic olay Christi L Scott Susan SubjectRE FTC NERC Comment of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics and of Policy Planning of the Federal Trade Commission After reading the FTC document I am concerned that we are loosing sight of the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser vice It will decide who uses the system how it will be used what schedu les will be accepted etc Do we really want it to set the standards by it s performance is to be judged by others There are two tendencies to guard against Most of these organizations are going to be notforprofit ISOs in form There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim ize outage risk and criticism of the RTOs management This could require the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary The opposite possiblity exists namely that they will adjust rules to cove r their own mistakes I think the former problem is the most likely If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested then the reliability rule s would have to become part of the FERC tariff In order to judge the vali dity of the reliability provisions of the tariffs the FERC will be requir ed to develop expertise it does not have In practice NERC doesnt have th e expertise either It really resides in the members of the committees and is thus derived from the industry By having a separate Standards Setting Organization the rules can still be established using the expertise of th e industry The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to complaint The SSOs governance has to be fair but I am not personally c oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight It is the service provider the RTO that needs to be independent The standards in most industries are set in this way The power of the state to enforce th e rules come from commissions of various types For instance the National Electric Code is developed by the industry but its enforcement is accompl ished by adopting it into building codes state liscensing requirements et c In the same way the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in corporated in FERCs requirement imposed on the RTO The RTOs tariff woul d incorporate them by reference If the RTOs performance violates the rule s or if a generator doesnt hold up its requirements then ADRFERC action can be taken to enforce My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service It should n ot see itself as a regulator The case of the CAISO is instructive since they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are the guardians of the public interest When the service provider thinks it regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who should have tr ansmission service rather than get on with providing it Steve Original Message From Perrino Dave SentTuesday August PM ToYeung Charles Shapiro Richard Steffes James D

Version of Legislation Rick The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NER C activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly EN RONNERC team conference call John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length o f its proposed Title on Reliability so as to look more like the PJM appro ach Fundamentally there are still major differences NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the SRO in the legislatio n Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson Dave Cook a nd Jeff Skilling we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug by NE RC stakeholders to finalize the NERC version would impact Jeffs request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of de ference to NERC to become the SRO or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization SSO The meeting on the th should not interfere with Jeffs ability to pr esent issues to the Board We dont think Jeff needs to contact John Q And erson or any NERC members about the Aug meeting However for the discus sions with NERC John Shelk plans to stay the line on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items and if Enron is appeased deference to NERC could still be given but not throug h legislation rather through FERC comfort that the SSO is doing a good j ob By knowing that FERC can pull the plug on the SSO if it is not satis fied this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to re solveaddress for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board Additionally Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC in its current form is not able to develop consensus rules t hat all its members are

<22058349.1075852467125.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,charles.yeung@enron.com,2001-08-22 04:43:05,RE Invitation to participate in CAEMs Grid Enhancement Evaluation Project Cc Steve I spoke with Phil Marsten on the phone to get more information as to the pu rpose of CAEM and its supporters As you know Enrons attempt at implementation of these technologies a coup le of years ago Randy Maffetts group hit upon many obstacles mostly res istance or reluctance by utilities to allow or sponsor such projects There is some value to the CAEM approach that is to help the vendorsprop rietors of the technology by educating regulators and policy makers to the value of these solutions Presently Phil is talking with some transmission companies but none of t he major problem area names were mentioned Phase I evaluating technology get a common understanding of these system s technically THEN analysis into the regulatory impacts includes hiring experts to evaluate the technologies cost commercialabi lity etc A CERTS DOE effort was technology focused not focused on the policy side I asked Phil if he was aware of any similar efforts at EPRI EEI or IEEE to see if there is any duplication He did not know I will ask someone t o research whether these organizations are trying the same If they are t hen there is no need to reinvent the wheel Phil mentioned that Rob Bradley has information on funding this effort that may allow Enron participation without financial contribution I left it open to invite Phil to meet with Enron folks if we are interested in joining In my opinion RTOs will ultimately have to be on board from both a plannin g and operational perspective to implement these solutions Policy makers are certainly important but RTO endorsement can be just as effective of a catalyst for implementing these solutions Regulators tend to defer to th e technical experts So would CAEM be effective or needed on the RTO front Also in Steve Waltons opinion much more ATC and TTC is left off the ta ble than what these technologies may be able to offer so you can get more bang for the buck by pushing for better NERC rules curbing regional counci l authority getting more FERC action etc CAEM technologies could become a crutch for a badboy utility to not doing what is right in the first pla ce We would not want a regulator to lose sight of the real problems at ha nd today Original Message From McVicker Maureen Sent Monday August PM To Yeung Charles Subject FW Invitation to participate in CAEMs Grid Enhancement Evaluatio n Project Importance High Charles Steve Kean received this email on Aug I forwarded the information vi a hard copy to Jim Steffes last week at Steves request I understand tha t Jim has forwarded it to you This man Phil Marston is calling Steve to follow up Please call Phil at and let him know if you are interested in meeting with him Please let me know what you decide so I can mark my records on how we resp onded Thanks Original Message From Marston

mailto Sent Wednesday July PM Subject Invitation to participate in CAEMs Grid Enhancement Evaluation Pr oject Steve Kean Enron Corp Delivered via email to mailto Dear Steve Im wearing a somewhat different hat today that of Adjunct Scholar to Ke n Malloys Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets CAEM In that ca pacity I am directing the Centers recently announced Grid Enhancement Eva luation Project The full proposal is attached below as a PDF file Ive a lso included for your records an updated resume on my qualifications to dir ect the Project You know better than any in the industry how the restructuring of the Natio ns electricity markets and regulatory infrastructure is continuing in the face of greater uncertainty than at any time since the oil price shocks of the s And as one of the major participants in the business as well as the policy debate over the future shape of the generation and transmission industries Enron is also well aware that a key component of any regulator y outcome will be efforts to enhance the performance of the transmission gr id The purpose of CAEMs Grid Enhancement Evaluation Project is therefor e to provide an independent assessment of the new grid debottlenecking and flow control and management technologies to provide the public and policy makers with a better understanding of how these new systems operate what they will cost how they may be deployed and in particular how these po tentially disruptive technologies will synch with the currently evolving regulatory framework This effort should be especially timely in light of the concern over the extent to which the current changes in the regulatory framework are really being created to address problems resulting from the c razyquilt legacy transmission system and may tend to institutionalize som e aspects of those legacy systems The Center is proposing to bring together a blueribbon panel to evaluate o pportunities for enhancing the nations electric transmission grid through the use of various new technologies including in particular solidstate po wer electronicsbased solutions FACTS technologies high voltage direct current HVDC interconnectors across seams in the regional grids an d superconductingbased technologies The Grid Enhancement Evaluation Proj ect is the only effort of its kind to bring together a diverse group of sen ior executives to undertake the following Agree upon the appropriate m ethodology Using the methodology authorize a panel of experts to indep endently evaluate the technologies on their state of development and curren t commercial viability Make policy recommendations on what changes may be required to integrate these new technologies into the existing regulator y framework and eliminate identified barriers to commercial deployment and Conduct an educational campaign to raise public awareness and acceptanc e of these technologies The project will begin in the Fall of and a Final Report will be issue d January The project is expected to have a significant impact on de cisions made by regulators financial analysts utility executives the med ia and potential customers Consistent with the Centers usual practice the Project will include public are as well as private sector participants and will culminate in a public report We would welcome your participation Steve or the appropriate Enron designa te to this effort Perhaps I can call you in a few days after youve had a chance to review the attached Project description which is about page s As Im currently out of the country the best way to reach me is via e mail at mailto and I will call you promptly at your convenience On behalf of the Center I thank you for considering participating in this timely Project Sincerely Philip M Marston Esq
