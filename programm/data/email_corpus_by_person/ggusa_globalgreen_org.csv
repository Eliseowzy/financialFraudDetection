Deadline Extended for Higher Cool Roof Rebate Amount In order to maximize opportunities to reduce electricity demand this year the California Energy Commission CEC has extended the deadline for the higher Cool Roof rebate amount of per square foot until October After October st rebates will be reduced to sf Over million in financial incentives are being offered by the CEC for the installation of cool roofs on existing and new buildings Eligible buildings include local government educational commercial and multifamily New residential developments are also eligible however existing singlefamily homes are not By reflecting rather than absorbing solar energy a cool roof reduces roof temperatures by F compared to a traditional hot roof As a result a cool roof lowers a buildings cooling energy requirements by over increases the lifespan of the roof and reduces peak electricity demand In addition since the installed price of cool roofing materials is typically the same as nonreflective materials the rebate makes cool roofs less expensive than traditional roofs The CEC has partnered with the nonprofit Local Government Commission LGC to administer the cool roof incentives statewide To

enforcement mechanism for a treaty banning the development or stockpiling of biological weapons but is pursuing an alternative with new urgency in the aftermath of the Sept attacks administration officials said yesterday The administration began telling allies this spring that it would not support a proposal to prevent cheating on the Biological Weapons Convention which the United States ratified with other nations The administration said the verification proposal was fatally flawed but said the United States wanted to find other ways to strengthen the treaty and reduce the chance of germ warfare Administration officials said they plan to present their ideas at a biological weapons conference that begins Nov in Switzerland Officials said the administration plans to propose that nations pass stricter laws criminalizing the use and import or export of biological weapons fund more research into illnesses caused by biological weapons and share information and expertise to minimize the effects if the weapons are used For complete story go to wpdynarticlesAOcthtml LOS ANGELES EVENTS WITH PRESIDENT GORBACHEV POSTPONED Following President Gorbachevs decision to cancel his

BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECOVERY PROGRAMS For Immediate Release ATLANTA January A unique coalition of industry governmental agencies and environmental organizations has released a study that for the first time provides baseline statistics on the costs benefits and effectiveness of programs to recover discarded beverage containers for recycling Understanding Beverage Container Recycling A Value Chain Assessment is the final report of the MultiStakeholder Recovery Project Stage One Businesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling BEAR a project of Global Green USA launched the initiative last Spring in an effort to bring together longstanding opponents in the battle over different approaches to recycling in a factbased approach to public policy making Project participants included The CocaCola Company Waste Management Inc Beaulieu of America Tomra North America Southeastern Container GrassRoots Recycling Network and the Container Recycling Institute The report was prepared by a research consulting team comprising RW Beck Inc Franklin Associates Ltd the Tellus Institute and Sound Resource Management Group Research was coordinated by the project manager Boisson Associates Working intensively over six months project participants made progress towards their objective of identifying jointly supported policies by participating in a study of existing US recovery programs We made a good start by showing that groups with divergent views can work together and reach substantial agreement said Ben Jordan Environmental Manager for The CocaCola Company We didnt agree to recommend any particular program but we established a model for overcoming the historical entrenchment that has stymied progress for two decades according to Rick Best Board Member of GrassRoots Recycling Network The report is a snapshot of US programs as they operated in and does not attempt to project how programs would perform if they were to be expanded or replicated in other areas The report contrasts the effectiveness of different programs in detail and verifies that deposit systems recover the highest percentage of discarded containers followed by municipal curbside programs and residential dropoff programs But the cost of recovery programs is more subtle than advocates on either side have been willing to admit said Pierre Ferrari BEARs Chair The findings indicate some ways that the costs of deposit and other recycling programs can be reduced But participants stressed that the report does not attempt to address important implementation questions regarding new or expanded recycling systems The report also shows the environmental advantages of recycling containers We documented several key benefits in this collaborative process for example beverage co ntainer recycling saved about trillion BTU in thats equivalent to over million barrels of oil said Matt Petersen President and CEO of Global Green USA Project participants agreed that there is a need to continue factbased collaborative discussions and will invite additional stakeholders to participate The MultiStakeholder Recovery Project is a critical component of the movement to secure voluntary longterm product stewardship agreements in the US according to Sherry Enzler Director of the Minnesota Office of Environmental Assistance Future efforts are likely to concentrate on addressing stakeholder concerns about different policies One key issue is the need for aggressive market development initiatives to minimize potential market volatility associated with increasing recovery Businesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling a project of Global Green USA is a coalition dedicated to increasing the national recycling rate for used beverage containers to Its members are united by agreement on principles including minimizing environmental impacts while improving all packaging creating sustainable jobs and businesses and working with clarity and honesty to understand costs and evaluate the widest range of policies and practices to achieve its goal Global Green USA created in as the US affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachevs environmental movement Green Cross International works in
