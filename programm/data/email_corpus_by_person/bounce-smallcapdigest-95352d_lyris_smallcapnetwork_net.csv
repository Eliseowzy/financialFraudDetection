Investors with a to month h orizon have the potential for a plus with the next cycle of surging oil prices As oil prices drop Ray Reaves is getting ready to add assets to Fi eldPoint The SmallCap Digest has discovered a growth company in the oil and gas sector that is poised to surge FieldPoint Petroleum OTC BB FPPC has taken much of the guessing out of investing in this sector The compan y

continue expanding in Texas and Wyoming as well as in other Rocky Mountain and midcontinent states such a s Montana North Dakota and Oklahoma It is a primary objective of the Comp any to operate most of the oil and gas properties in which it has an econom ic interest Company Analysis FieldPoint is regarded in the industry as a nimble low cost provider Unlike many of its competitors FieldPoint co nsistently generates positive cash flow and has a history of acquiring pro perties far below market prices Many poorly run oil and gas companies get themselves in a position where they must raise cash to survive These distr ess sales allow FieldPoint to purchase these companies properties at price s where the production from the land pays for the purchase itself FieldPoi nt takes advantage of the competition through efficiency The companys ste llar performance in the past has created confidence and tremendous leeway w ith financiers FieldPoint has access to capital that will allow for growth while most of its competitors will experience contraction The companys track record speaks for itself Below is the revenue growth FieldPoint ha s experienced in the past three years IMAGE As depicted

production and reserves has grown consistently since In FieldPoint had million in booked assets from which they derived in revenue and in net income The average price of oil in wa s approximately per barrel In prior to going public FieldPo ints results were slightly improved as the price of oil per barrel increas ed to an average of but their asset base held steady At the end of FieldPoint completed another acquisition that boosted assets to million and through the third quarter assets stood at million In the meantime revenues have jumped from last year and are projected a t million this year As a low cost producer FieldPoint successfully i ncreases production and lowers operational expenses every time they make an acquisition Over the course of the next months the company hopes to accumulate over million in assets Past performance would indicate t his is not an unrealistic goal That is a tenfold increase from where the c ompanys assets are today For investors the market capitalization of the company should reflect the increase in assets A million dollar asset b ase would value the company at approximately million dollars or p er share That is an annualized gain of over over a four year period Market Conditions A dispute between OPEC which produces about of th e worlds oil and nonOPEC oil producing countries have pushed prices to th eir lowest levels since mid Oil markets opened lower Thursday after t he Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided Wednesday not to c ut its output quotas unless nonOPEC producers agree to go along Russian P rime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is quoted by the Financial Times as saying We are not going to at any time reduce production on a big scale its impo ssible With oil prices taking a nosedive many poorly run and poorly f unded oil and gas companies will be feeling the squeeze Lower oil prices w ill deal a blow to the oil and gas industry resulting in less investment reduced production and ultimately more volatility as supply and demand fluc tuate This means FieldPoint will be privy to some very attractive opportun ities to purchase land at very favorable prices However oil prices may not stay depressed next year OPEC says it will cut output on Jan only if nonOPEC producers act So far Oman and Mexico have pledged output cuts of barrels a day and barrels a day respectively and Norway the worlds third largest exporter is still considering whether to contribute But all three countries say they will only reduce production i f Russia pledges to cut its output by some barrels a day Conclus ion FieldPoint is currently trading at but in the near term has the potential to reach due to the sizable opportunities the company curr ently has to expand its asset base at rock bottom prices We expect the st ock to reach this target in the next days A target of would mean a short term profit This doesnt match the companys growth rate but i t is certainly respectable and much higher on an annualized basis Grow ing companies need to reinvest in themselves The challenge is to make mone y while growing FieldPoint applies the cardinal rule of business MAKE MON EY CEO Ray Reaves has demonstrated an uncanny ability to propel growth whi le running a profitable business The goal of the company is to increase it s asset base while maintaining profitability and providing shareholders a return on their money Over the course of the next months the comp any expects to have over million in assets That is a tenfold increase from where the companys assets are today If the companys past performanc e is any indication it is an obtainable goal For for investors the marke t capitalization of the company should reflect the increase in assets A million dollar asset base would value the company at approximately mi llion dollars or per share That is an annualized gain of over ov er a four year period FieldPoint is structured to take full advantage o f volatility because the company thrives on outsmarting its competitors T he company is a growth stock that has the full confidence of its financier s This access to capital allows the company to increase its assets while benefiting

January IMAGE NASDAQ IMAGE For info visit wwwsmallcap networknet IMAGE S P IMAGE To be removed please click here IMAGE Russell IMAGE VOLUME ISSUE IMAGE What is a Reverse Merger Investors are familiar with the traditional IP O initial public offering as a method for going public However the curr ent market environment makes going public just about impossible This does nt mean that no new companies are coming to market Many people dont re alize there are numerous other ways for private company to become publicly traded outside of the IPO One widely used method is the Reverse Merger a simplified fast track method by which a private company can become a P ublic Company This method for going public is more prevalent than most i nvestors realize One study estimates that of all companies obtaining p ublic listings in did so through the Reverse Merger The same study concluded about of newly publicly listed companies got there through Re verse Mergers in Percentages have recently dropped because Wall Stree t Investment Banking firms have had a huge appetite for IPOs in the late s This led to many marginal companies receiving enormous financial windfal ls In todays climate we expect reverse mergers to become more prevalent w ith very few IPOs finding their way to completion Simply defined a reve rse merger occurs when a public company which has no business and usually l imited assets acquires a private company with a viable business The Privat e company Reverse Merges into the already public company which now becom es an entirely new operating entity and generally changes name to reflect t he new merged companys business The original public company commonly k nown as a Shell company has value because of its publicly traded status T he shell company is generally recapitalized and issues shares to acquire th e private company giving shareholders and management of the private compan y majority control of the newly formed public company Reverse Mergers ar e also commonly referred to as Reverse Takeovers or RTOs Benefits of G oing Public Through the RTO Reverse Take Over The RTO reverse take ove r method for going public has numerous benefits for the private company Initial costs are much lower and excessive investment banking fees are avo ided The time frame for becoming public is considerably shorter There i s no significant regulatory review or regulatory approval for the transacti on The company can now use its stock as currency to finance acquisitions and attract quality management Capital is easier to raise as investors no w have a clearly defined exit strategy Insiders can create significant we alth if they perform Negatives of Going Public Through the RTO There i s no capital raised in conjunction with going public There is limited spo nsorship for the stock There is no high powered Wall Street Investment Ba nking relationship The stock generally trades on a low exposure exchange Things You Should Know About RTOs Investors Beware Many highly succes sful companies have become public through the RTO process However there s ome important negatives investors should be aware of There is a much hig her failure rate amongst RTO companies versus the traditional IPO Much sma ller and less successful companies are able to become public through the RT O and many are badly undercapitalized Often these stocks trade very ineff iciently in the absence of any sponsorship or following There is a cotta ge industry of merchant bankers and entrepreneurs who specialize in orchest rating reverse mergers Unfortunately there are no barriers to entry in th is field Therefore scams are common place Through various methods sca m artists manage to accumulate large positions in the free trading shares o f the shell company An RTO is consummated with a marginal private company and the scam artists put together a massive publicity campaign designed to create activity in the stock Unrealistic promises and absurd claims of co rporate performance find their way to the public The enhanced trading volu me allows the scam artist to dump his shares on the unsuspecting public mo st of whom eventually lose their money once the newly formed public company fails This scam is commonly known as a Pump and Dump Alternatively t here a hundreds of examples of highly successful companies which have yield ed millions in profits for investors that have gone public through the RTO Many of these companies deserve exposure to investors Initial valuations can be reasonable providing excellent opportunities for individual investo rs to accumulate positions ahead of Wall Street institutional money Some High Profile and Successful RTOs Armand Hammer world renowned oil magna te and industrialist is generally credited with having invented the Rever se Merger In the s Hammer invested in a shell company into which he merged multi decade winner Occidental Petroleum In Ted Turner comple ted a reverse merger with Rice Broadcasting which went on to become Turner Broadcasting In Muriel Siebert renown as the first woman member o f the New York Stock Exchange took her brokerage firm public by reverse me rging with J Michaels a defunct Brooklyn Furniture company One of the D ot Com fallen Angels Rare Medium RRRR merged with a lackluster refrige ration company and changed the entire business This was a stock in which found its way over in Acclaim Entertainment AKLM merge d into non operating TeleCommunications Inc in Cross Media Marketin g XMM a stock that SmallCap Digest readers are familiar with merged in to non operating Brack Industries in Cross Media is on track to gener ate million in revenues and over million in profits in Alth ough we cant confirm this from old records Viacom is rumored to have been an RTO There are hundreds of other examples of highly successful RTOs a nd thousands of failures Individual investors can profit from knowing abou t these situations before Wall Street gets involved and places its own infl ated value on the company Investors that got into Cross Media early Novemb er are getting a taste of the benefit of getting in ahead of Wall Street mo ney managers The SmallCap Digest issued a short term trading alert on this company November th At the time the stock was trading at x next years earnings with a growth rate If Wall Street had done the IPO you would have never seen such a compelling value in the open market Institutional izing the RTO Verus International Wall Street Brokerage Firms have look ed down their nose at RTOs for years There are no massive investment banki ng fees generated in an RTO and companies hitting the public market throug h this route are generally high risk However there is a New York based Merchant Banking firm in a position to change this perception Verus Intern ational located in Midtown Manhattan has the credentials and credibility to force Wall Street to stand up and take notice Their Advisory Board re ads like a Whos Who of Wall Street power players As disclosed on their we b site here is a list of people on th e Verus International advisory board Jack Rivkin Executive Vice Preside nt in charge of

Currently with ING Formally with Goldman Sachs CitiGroup has a minority ownership stake in Verus International and provi des the expertise of Wall Street legend Jack Rivkin to their management tea m While this does not insure their projects wont fail like any others in vestors can assume Verus has the opportunity to structure highly sought aft er projects due to their financial community relationships In the near f uture a Verus International client company will open for trading on the Ame rican Stock Exchange after completing an RTO We believe this stock will tr ade like a highly

GE IMAGE Dow Jones pm EST Fri October IMAGE NASDAQ For info visit wwwsmallcapnetworknet IMAGE S P To be removed please click here IMAGE Russell IMAGE Dear SmallCap Network Members Wall Street pros continue a rather heated debate over market valuations with battle results unfolding with each and every twist and turn of the pop ular averages Are pricetoearnings PE multiples on the broad market st ill too high We continue to do considerable research on this subject and have some good news and bad news to report Lets get the bad news out of the way first By historical measures current broad market value remains r elatively high The PE ratio on the SP has averaged times earnings over the past years Today the earnings multiple on the SP stands at just over times and is projected at times next years consensus e arnings forecast At the recent September lowwater mark of the PE multiple on the SP got down to times still well above the year average What most Wall Street firms are reluctant to tell is the fa ct that the average PE multiple at bearmarket bottoms over the past ye ars has been times earnings This is hardly reassuring if you consider yourself more bull than bear Thats as far as were going with the bad ne ws Suffice it to say we are reluctantly bullish so lets get to some good news First the fiveyear high PE multiple on the SP was We were unable to confirm this but believe this could represent an historic alltime high Fortunately this PE multiple was achieved at about the sa me time many fledgling and nowdefunct Internet startups were trading at times SALES not earnings IMAGE The low PE multiple on the S P was times earnings a full five years ago The broad market was in an advance that saw it double from October of to March of befo re crashing from its peak The PE on the SP was cut in half by the ti me it hit its September low While there continues to be downside risk this has to be considered pretty good news going forward The good news fo r individual investors doesnt end there Over the past years inflation has run at an average of but is holding steady at today The averag e yield on year Treasury notes during the same period is but today the yield is down to just Combine this with the fact that money marke t funds hold around trillion in cash versus an trillion total marke t capitalization and the outlook for stocks begins to brighten just a bit Whether PEs continue to contract hold steady or expand is really a fu nction of earnings performance going forward Estimates for earnings o n the SP have continued to contract as the economic slowdown drags on The challenge for the companies that make up the SP average will be t o beat those reduced estimates next year With the threat of inflation unde r control and interest rates at a year low largecap corporate America has an excellent foundation to produce some positive surprises next year The challenge for the individual investor is to find opportunities for grow th in a marketplace littered with growthstock casualties This is also why many Wall Street professionals have singled out micro and small cap value stocks to outperform the broad market over the next months Why Bec ause they are underfollowed and many of them are considerably undervalued AN UNDERVALUED MICRO CAP STOCK IN REVIEW One company weve uncovered th at represents a solid speculative micro cap value is MWave Inc NASDAQ MWAV MWAV manufactures microwave frequency components and highfrequency circuit boards using Teflonbased laminates These products are widely use d in variety of applications for wireless telecommunications and Internet s ervice products For the sixmonth period ending MWAVs revenues totaled million up from million while net income rose to mil lion from thousand With no known analyst coverage MWAV is trading at a market capitalization of about millionjust of last years m illion in revenues Even more intriguing from a valuation standpoint MWAV currently trades at times trailing month earnings and just a shade over x book value The Company announced revenues were on track to exceed last years levels and they project million in revenues in the next two to three years Some investors may shy away from companies in this gro up because they have been pummeled over the past year and a half Regardles s of its past performance of its stock price MWAVs revenue growth is proj ected to grow by over in the next two to three years MWAV shareholders have excellent upside potential from current levels In fact according to the NASDAQ three new institutional shareholders have reported adding new positions in MWAV over the past six months The fundamentals look pretty s olid going forward Lets take a look at the technical outlook The chart b elow highlights MWAV shares trading at a high as late as February When the market peaked in MWAV shares hit an alltime high of MWA V hit a closing yearly low of on September IMAGE Share s of MWAV represent a very good value for speculative investors at current levels Downside risk of about appears to be buffeted by the book value of the Company The million market cap represents just of an ticipated forward revenues of million whether it takes two to three ye ars get there We believe MWAV has an excellent opportunity to hit their r evenue goal and see their market cap expand to x revenues at some point in the next two to three years In fact if the Company were to reach a reven ue valuation of x on a trailing basis a return from todays closing price would be realized On a worstcase scenario MWAV shares appear to ho ld downside risk The SmallCap Network believes MWAV has an excelle nt chance to retest its alltime high IF they achieve the revenue results t hey have publicly stated they are targeting With million shares outst anding achieving a million market cap would produce a share pr ice at some point in the next two to three years In our view upside potential versus downside represents a riskreward scenario we are perfectly willing to live with regardless of whether the broad market i s over under or fairly valued Well look forward to presenting more of t hese types of situations in the weeks and months ahead SmallCap Network M embers are advised this is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to b uy securities Members are advised to perform their own due diligence and u se
