October PM To Christopher F CT Ben F CT Subject FW MHI f storage team The proposed plan on the MHI units is to ship Units and to the US for storeage at a central location The storeage costs are significantly less than proposed by MHI and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be beneficial for a potential sale From an economic perspective it would be better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly However given a lack of any firm sale the recommendation is to ship them to the US and store Let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with the shipment Thanks Brett Forwarded by Brett R WiggsSAEnron on PM From Ron nronXgate on PM CDT To Brett R nron cc David nronXgate Phillip nronXgate Mike nronXgate Subject FW MHI f storage team Brett we
