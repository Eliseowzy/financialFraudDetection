and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable

speak with you again and send me some suggested language I am a bit confused though and wonder if you can explain When I first mentioned this to the bank I told them that as if their credit rating went down their credit limit would drop so by implication there would not necessarily be any event of default Is this the case or would a drop in their credit rating from A automatically trigger an event of default The former will of course make it much easier to sell them our proposal involving us having the option to post collateral before there can be an event of default Sorry if I sound a

respective input where indicted Thanks heaps to both of you Jane McBride I am also attaching my memorandum to them Forwarded by Jane McBrideAPEnron on PM Teruyo Suzuki PM To cc Yamato Konishi Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Dear Jane Reviewing your comments our current position is as follows Part b US Basically our companyfs guideline for the Threshold Amount is US but it seems very small for significant customers and we can change it to US As this amount is usually agreed in the Master Agreement with major commercial banks we hope this is acceptable to you too John is there any way we can accept this I think it is going to be difficult to get them to agree so if you still cant accept it is there a ny way you can agree to the million limit if at the same time something els e is changed g As for we would like to add gthe obligations of such resultin g surviving or transferee entity hereunder are guaranteed by Enron Corp h in th line after gEnron Corph IBJ could accept to continue the Transactions with the counterparty when it merges with the other company and becomes materially weaker if the surviving company is guaranteed by Enron Corp Sara Do you think we can accept this We would not be agreeing necessaril y to give a corporate guarantee but instead would have the option of putting one in place to avoid a default If the concept is OK on your side I thin k we should add hereunder as indicted above or something to restrict the obligations which need to be guaranteed Sara I would also like to add a after party at the end of line of paragraph g of Part of the Schedule OK Regarding please delete it because it refers to Credit Support Annex which we are not going to enter into for the time being Sara the question is whether we just delete the language or replace it wi th something else The second option would be better and given the discretion Y would have in this situation IBJ should not object provided the drafting works Do you have any ideas of anything which would work within the framework of the rest of the schedule and the master The final sentence should go anyway I guess John I guess you may need to consider above with Sara h Agreed k Agreed Part Regarding further document for certification we can include the following language gAny certificate or document reasonably requested by the other party evidencing or certifying that the execution delivery and performance of this Agreement by the party requested has been duly authorizedh I think this sounds OK As for annual report we will revert to you John As you can see from my memo as a starting point I have asked them to tell us what they have available re financials and will revert when I hear back from them to see what you think Part a Agreed f Even if there are Transactions between us which settle on the same day our operation can not net the payment of the same currency Our syste m does not allow the payment netting of more than one Transaction John They want to delete not from this provision I think we need to assume that they are telling us the truth and that they just cant do it The question is then do we delete not or do we delete the entire paragra ph f from Part of the schedule Pls let me know what you want to do h New York Branch address Avenue of The Americas New York NY USA Part a When an option buyer who fully paid the premium goes bankrupt we believe it will be more practicable that the other party option seller terminate a transaction according to Section a and pay the amount payabl e under Section e if any to the option buyer If option seller does not terminate the transaction it sounds unnatural that the option seller pay the remaining payment on each payment date to the receiver of the defaulting party option buyer We do not usually include the safety net provision for a technical default Even if payment default due to operational error there is ample three days grace period for nonpayment party after receiving the notice of nonpayment by the other party Sara what do you think how flexible do you think we can be on this e Agreed g I understand the benefit that nondefaulting party could setoff its Affiliatefs obligation against defaulting partyfs obligation Bu t in Japan only setoff between the parties who entered into the Agreement is allowed If you know the case that in any country an applicable law permits to setoff the amount owed by the nondefaulting partyfs Affilia te against the amount owed by the defaulting party please let us know Sara any comments I am checking whether what they saying about Japanese law is true h As we should also obtain our Credit Departmentfs approval of cred it line for the transferee before agreeing the transfer we would like to insert the following words at the end of a new Section c gAnd provided further that the transferring party has notified nontransferring party of the proposed transfer and the nontransferring party has not objected to the proposed transfer within days of such notification it being understood that the sole grounds for objection shall be the nontransferring partyfs good faith belief that the proposed transfer would give rise to an adverse tax regulatory or legal or interna l credit policy consequences or material credit concerns to the nontransferring party or that necessary internal credit approval has not been grantedh Sara As noted in my memo to them I had thought we may be willing to add to the end of this paragraph and provided that the transfer does not cause an y adverse tax consequences for the other party in relation to which the transferring party is not willing to indemnify the other party They have asked us to go far further than this now and I am not sure that we should b e willing to agree to anything after legal in line given that the guarant ee provision should give their credit department comfort Part We can accept a b and e but cannot agree with cdfg and h Sara your thoughts If you have any question or uncertainty about the above items please let me know Thank you for your assistance in this matter Teruyo Suzuki Industrial Bank of Japan

Houston time on Nov at I look forward to hearing from you Regards Sara Jane NRON AM To John CT Alan CT cc John nron Jonathan nron Mark CT Sara CT Subject IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Credit matrix and Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for

respective input where indicted Thanks heaps to both of you Jane McBride I am also attaching my memorandum to them Forwarded by Jane McBrideAPEnron on PM Teruyo Suzuki PM To cc Yamato Konishi Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Dear Jane Reviewing your comments our current position is as follows Part b US Basically our companyfs guideline for the Threshold Amount is US but it seems very small for significant customers and we can change it to US As this amount is usually agreed in the Master Agreement with major commercial banks we hope this is acceptable to you too John is there any way we can accept this I think it is going to be difficult to get them to agree so if you still cant accept it is there a ny way you can agree to the million limit if at the same time something els e is changed g As for we would like to add gthe obligations of such resultin g surviving or transferee entity hereunder are guaranteed by Enron Corp h in th line after gEnron Corph IBJ could accept to continue the Transactions with the counterparty when it merges with the other company and becomes materially weaker if the surviving company is guaranteed by Enron Corp Sara Do you think we can accept this We would not be agreeing necessaril y to give a corporate guarantee but instead would have the option of putting one in place to avoid a default If the concept is OK on your side I thin k we should add hereunder as indicted above or something to restrict the obligations which need to be guaranteed Sara I would also like to add a after party at the end of line of paragraph g of Part of the Schedule OK Regarding please delete it because it refers to Credit Support Annex which we are not going to enter into for the time being Sara the question is whether we just delete the language or replace it wi th something else The second option would be better and given the discretion Y would have in this situation IBJ should not object provided the drafting works Do you have any ideas of anything which would work within the framework of the rest of the schedule and the master The final sentence should go anyway I guess John I guess you may need to consider above with Sara h Agreed k Agreed Part Regarding further document for certification we can include the following language gAny certificate or document reasonably requested by the other party evidencing or certifying that the execution delivery and performance of this Agreement by the party requested has been duly authorizedh I think this sounds OK As for annual report we will revert to you John As you can see from my memo as a starting point I have asked them to tell us what they have available re financials and will revert when I hear back from them to see what you think Part a Agreed f Even if there are Transactions between us which settle on the same day our operation can not net the payment of the same currency Our syste m does not allow the payment netting of more than one Transaction John They want to delete not from this provision I think we need to assume that they are telling us the truth and that they just cant do it The question is then do we delete not or do we delete the entire paragra ph f from Part of the schedule Pls let me know what you want to do h New York Branch address Avenue of The Americas New York NY USA Part a When an option buyer who fully paid the premium goes bankrupt we believe it will be more practicable that the other party option seller terminate a transaction according to Section a and pay the amount payabl e under Section e if any to the option buyer If option seller does not terminate the transaction it sounds unnatural that the option seller pay the remaining payment on each payment date to the receiver of the defaulting party option buyer We do not usually include the safety net provision for a technical default Even if payment default due to operational error there is ample three days grace period for nonpayment party after receiving the notice of nonpayment by the other party Sara what do you think how flexible do you think we can be on this e Agreed g I understand the benefit that nondefaulting party could setoff its Affiliatefs obligation against defaulting partyfs obligation Bu t in Japan only setoff between the parties who entered into the Agreement is allowed If you know the case that in any country an applicable law permits to setoff the amount owed by the nondefaulting partyfs Affilia te against the amount owed by the defaulting party please let us know Sara any comments I am checking whether what they saying about Japanese law is true h As we should also obtain our Credit Departmentfs approval of cred it line for the transferee before agreeing the transfer we would like to insert the following words at the end of a new Section c gAnd provided further that the transferring party has notified nontransferring party of the proposed transfer and the nontransferring party has not objected to the proposed transfer within days of such notification it being understood that the sole grounds for objection shall be the nontransferring partyfs good faith belief that the proposed transfer would give rise to an adverse tax regulatory or legal or interna l credit policy consequences or material credit concerns to the nontransferring party or that necessary internal credit approval has not been grantedh Sara As noted in my memo to them I had thought we may be willing to add to the end of this paragraph and provided that the transfer does not cause an y adverse tax consequences for the other party in relation to which the transferring party is not willing to indemnify the other party They have asked us to go far further than this now and I am not sure that we should b e willing to agree to anything after legal in line given that the guarant ee provision should give their credit department comfort Part We can accept a b and e but cannot agree with cdfg and h Sara your thoughts If you have any question or uncertainty about the above items please let me know Thank you for your assistance in this matter Teruyo Suzuki Industrial Bank of Japan

speak with you again and send me some suggested language I am a bit confused though and wonder if you can explain When I first mentioned this to the bank I told them that as if their credit rating went down their credit limit would drop so by implication there would not necessarily be any event of default Is this the case or would a drop in their credit rating from A automatically trigger an event of default The former will of course make it much easier to sell them our proposal involving us having the option to post collateral before there can be an event of default Sorry if I sound a bit vague but this is all still a bit new to me Secondly we now have their replies to our comments on the various outstanding issues and I will forward these to you now for your input including on the threshold amount point Jane McBride Jane McBride PM To John CT Alan AronowitzHOUECT cc John nron Jonathan nron Mark CT Sara CT Subject IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Credit matrix and Threshold amount Dear John Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the

and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable

think I have been clear enough and I am sorry We here at Enron Japan have no particular desire or resources at the moment to send out EOL related correspondence from here If however EOL decides it is better for EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron Japan Corp as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter rather than any other Enron entity then we will have to review and sign the correspondence since it will create legal obligations for us or have someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp and for the EOL logo to be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we EJ needed to register the logo as a business trade name here I am not sure whether this has been done Also note that at the moment although the Japanese version of the letterhead refers to Enron Japan Corp the English translation says EnronOnLine In any case these should be consistent I would think On the other hand if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC or another Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would be our preference I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their customers over to EOL The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the market The time therefore may come when we prefer to personalize our EOL dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I dont think that time has quite come yet As a separate issue if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on its letters to Japanese counterparties it may have to register a branch and this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC This would need to considered by Susan Musch Pls let me know what you decide to do and again I

please let me know Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product Re the Product Descriptions in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen and not in USD we have used upper case for Business Days because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays and I have incorporated a new definition the relevant Scheduled Trading Date so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure the top half of the product description can be the same for both products despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done days after a different date in the case of the two definitions and only the bottom half will need to change I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs I have assumed that when NY law applies to foreign products we dont usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by nonUS counter parties I am less sure however about the events of default clause The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably dont put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the

reverting to you I have had to involve numerous people throughout our organization who have been involved to date in gathering the legal data we have accumulated in relation to the legal issues associated with the trading of weather derivatives here I am attaching our latest proposal for your consideration I still need to get sign off from our head of legal in London this evening on this drafting but do not expect any problems In the interests of time I have not set out our reasoning here I think Mr Wani is very familiar with the various issues both on the part of your client and on our part If however your client is not willing to accept this language and needs us to explain our reasoning in detail I would like to arrange a meeting to be attended by Mr Wani our lawyers at Tokyo Aoyama Law Offices me and your client to resolve these issues On the other issue we think JPY would be far more appropriate than JPY Finally we will negotiate the ISDA master with your client separately but will not accept the argument at that time that because we agreed to Japanese law in this confirmation we should agree then At this stage no further discussion need take place on this

cc Subject RE ToaRe documentation PM Dear Ms McBride Our answer is as follows We have no comments on this point As to clause ci and the amended iii we have no objection However it is our opinion that both of the parties represent and warrant each other As to ii we are informed by Mr Ono that this transaction does not come under ii for ToaRe as its purpose is not hedging If ToaRe represents and warrants as clause cii it is false representation and warranty Clause cii therefore should be deleted We think clause ciii is a good enough representation to clear the gambling matter It is our opinion that Japanese law is better for our client in the ISDA Master Our suggestion is JPY As this is the practical matter we have no comments We apologize for the delay Best regards Akihiro Wani

Please let me know if you have any trouble reading it with the redlining You will note We have amended the FRWS This has been done in consultation with your client so I dont expect this to be a problem We cannot give the warranties in clause c We also do not accept your clients reasons for not giving the warranties to us but as alternative to paragraph iii would suggest you warrant the legality of your entering into of the contract We trust you can have no objections to this new warranty In our opinion the analysis you have suggested in relation to paragraph ii is relevant only in the context of a credit derivative and not a weather derivative so would ask that this be retained We have agreed to Japanese law but only on the understanding that your client will agree to New York law or UK law if they prefer for the ISDA which we will start negotiating as soon as this confirmation is finalized and on the basis that you accept our amended form of clause Pls make a suggestion

and push our negotiations through to the end They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly their back mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course They acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank They did say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do so Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime if you are still willing to do so The bank has a credit rating of A so I guess this means US million credit limit On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract without a full CSA I wonder who is best to do this drafting I should be able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the drafting Alan do you have any suggestions Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the Threshold Amount definition to US million Is there any flexibility on this Thanks Jane McBride John CT AM To Jonathan NRON cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Jonathan One thing we might be able to propose is a Credit Matrix which prescribes a Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact with collateral rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each counterparty We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change MAC clauses This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs We are comfortable because as the counterpartys credit quality deteriorates the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases I would propose to IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA Jane and John is it possible to draft these collateralcredit terms into the contract without using a full CSA I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a CSA Rating SP Credit Line AA or above MM BBB to AA MM BBB MM BBB MM BB to BB MM Below BB MM These terms are subject to negotiation Once again the matrix removes MAC clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such but effectively reduces the potential exposure we have or THEY have to a counterparty with diminishing credit quality What do you all think John Jonathan Whitehead ENRON PM To John CT cc Jane nron John nron Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E nron Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Sorry Pressed send too early John Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA and they have asked us to consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA I propose to meet with them again to try and explore why but I would like to be prepared to offer them a solution whereby we dont enter into a CSA and we would limit the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ My feeling is that we would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions over years at this stage anyway and would prefer to get the relationship going as I am not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet They appear to be quite willing to discuss all the other points We can always press for a renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate What are your thoughts on this and what limitations would you want to put on trades if we do not have a CSA Thanks Jonathan John Viverito PM To John CT cc Jane CT John CT Kevin CT Mark CT Morten E CT Steven CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT John During our last meeting with IBJ we pushed hard for the implementation of the CSA I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the requisite activities relating to the CSA as we understand that they utilize same with certain financial institution counterparties We expressed our view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in our recent conference call IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the first We requested that they raise this issue with their respective superiors As you know their response to our discussions relating to this issue was In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA The legitimacy of this statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be something entirely different including the possibility that they merely do not want to enter into a CSA with a nonfinancial institution We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron however it is uncertain if this is achievable

think I have been clear enough and I am sorry We here at Enron Japan have no particular desire or resources at the moment to send out EOL related correspondence from here If however EOL decides it is better for EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron Japan Corp as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter rather than any other Enron entity then we will have to review and sign the correspondence since it will create legal obligations for us or have someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp and for the EOL logo to be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we EJ needed to register the logo as a business trade name here I am not sure whether this has been done Also note that at the moment although the Japanese version of the letterhead refers to Enron Japan Corp the English translation says EnronOnLine In any case these should be consistent I would think On the other hand if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC or another Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would be our preference I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their customers over to EOL The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the market The time therefore may come when we prefer to personalize our EOL dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I dont think that time has quite come yet As a separate issue if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on its letters to Japanese counterparties it may have to register a branch and this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC This would need to considered by Susan Musch Pls let me know what you decide to do and again I

following format I am getting some EOL stationery printed up with the Enron Australia address in the top right hand corner for the purpose of sending these letters out and was thinking from a marketing perspective it might be a good idea to do the same for Enron Japan Corp I suggest that perhaps the best way to do it would be for me to process them at my end then send them along with the rest of the package on to you guys so that Joe can sign it and it can then be forwarded on to the counterparty Alternatively I may be able to send them directly from here using Sheri Thomas stamp for the signature Here is a draft of the proposed letterhead Please provide any thoughts or advise of your preference ASAP so that I may go ahead and arrange for the stationery to be printed Thanks
