<17835251.1075859213723.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jjensen@haas.berkeley.edu,2001-12-19 11:25:55,Fwd UCPOLICE INFORMATION BULLETIN Holiday Season Safety Tips The University of California Police Department would like to take this opportunity to wish the campus community a safe and happy holiday season As part of that wish we are providing information on campus services operated by Public Safety and Transportation as well as general safety information The Police Department offers services hrsday Some units within UCPD will be closed or operate at reduced staffing during the break but Patrol Division will be fully staffed over the holidays Police services are always available at our office in Room Sproul Hall enter via the south basement doors on the Bancroft Ave side of the building Daytime Shuttle Services serving the entire campus will discontinue operation for the holiday break on Friday December at pm and resume operation at am on Wednesday January The Night Safety Shuttles will discontinue operation at am on Friday December and resume operation at pm on Tuesday January This break in night service includes the Owl Service operated by UCPD between am and am The Night Escort Service operates every day of the year Winter hours are pm to am Service can be requested by calling WALK Requests during the winter break are answered by the UCPD Police Dispatcher There may be slight delays in escort dispatch if more urgent police business is inprogress The following tips are provided to help everyone avoid being the victim of thefts or other problems that occur more frequently during this period Campus thieves are more active during the holidays They typically come into large buildings during the lunch period PM to PM and prowl through office areas looking for wallets or packages Employees in card access controlled buildings should be alert to strangers attempting to tailgate or follow an employee while they enter a building or floor A simple Can I help you or Who are you looking for may sort out the potential thief from the legitimate visitor Suspicious persons in buildings or office areas should be reported to UCPD by dialing from any telephone NOTE There is no longer a requirement to dial an extra prior to dialing from campus telephones If you are using a cellular telephone we recommend that you do NOT dial to report an emergency unless you are on a highway or out of your home area because all cellular calls are routed through the California Highway Patrol and can experience significant delay All centers in California also maintain traditional digit emergency numbers To call UCPD from a cellular phone in an emergency use our digit emergency number We recommend that this number as well as local digit emergency numbers for other areas that you frequent be programmed into convenient speed dial locations on your cellular handset A list of digit emergency numbers for many Bay Area departments is contained on pages of UCPDs Safety Counts booklet People should avoid leaving their wallet or purse unattended in a cubicle or office particularly during the lunch period Locking a wallet in a desk or credenza will reduce the possibility of theft significantly Similarly packages should be secured in a locked room or left where someone can watch them People should make copies of their credit cards checking account statements drivers license and other critical documents they keep in their wallet or purse along with the customer contact numbers to report the loss of those cards and documents The inventory should be stored in a secure place both at work and at home Major credit card companies such as MasterCard and Visa offer a free service to consolidate the reporting of lost or stolen credit cards which requires the employee to only make one call The loss of credit cards should also be reported to credit agencies such as TRW to protect the employee from adverse credit reporting when the card is misused If purchases are made using credit cards people should keep a copy of the transaction as many companies offer free replacement of the purchased item if it is lost or stolen within a certain period time While shopping in malls people should try to park in well lighted areas as close to the mall as possible as the majority of vehicle burglaries occur in outer areas of the parking lot where there is less foot traffic Packages should be stored in the vehicle trunk or covered with a blanket or similar item if left in a station wagon SUV or other vehicle with no trunk People should use their auto alarm as noise does tend to attract attention Caution should also be used when parking in BART lots and adjacent off street parking areas People should use their home alarm system while they are away particularly during weekdays as there is an increase in home burglaries during this period It is also helpful to place lights in a vacant home on automatic timers to make a home appear to be lived in at night while you are away Finally while everyone is enjoying all of the holiday festivities they should be mindful of the fact that traffic fatalities increase dramatically during this period due to poor weather conditions and an increase in alcohol consumption particularly around New Years Law enforcement agencies increase their staffing during this time and the use of sobriety checkpoints is becoming widespread particularly in the Bay Area Designated drivers at parties is a good tactic as is the use of a taxi service which many cities provide for free on New Years Eve Please pass this information on to the campus community along with our wishes for a great and safe holiday season If you would like to download a copy of this information as a flyer for posting a
