Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM Department of Water Resources Wants Money to Flow Their Way Six months ago Department of Water Resources took over power purchasing responsibility from the nearly insolvent investorowned utilities The general fund was first tapped then a shortterm loan allowed the purchasin g to continue Now the state needs to issue billion in bonds authorize d in SBX Burton DSan Francisco to be paid back by utility ratepayers for more than a decade On July the CPUC must decide how much of utility rates should be siphone d off to pay off the bonds and the ongoing costs of power being purchased on the spot market and under short and long term power contracts signed by DWR This dedicated revenue stream DRS will be based on the latest ana lysis by utility and administration financial experts The big question is whether current rates are high enough to cover all utility generation costs nuclea r qualifying facilities hydro etc DWR power costs and all the other elements of rates public purpose charges transmission and distribution etc Many assumptions about the spot market the effects of the FERC pri ce mitigation order and the level of customer demand enter into the calculatio n of the DRS Wholesale spot prices have recently dropped but there still could be a shortfall that would need to be made up in higher rates or with more borrowing to push off repayment to the future In related news last week the CPUC nearly ordered the suspension of direct access in order to ensure that customers would not be able to leave utility service and thus escape the payment of bond and DWR power costs Customer groups were able to persuade regulators to put off the decision pending legislation that could clarify a direct access customers obligation to pay a fair share of these costs To that end ABX Hertzberg DVan Nuys is being amended to make the bonds secured by the DRS rather than DWR contract s thus creating more regulatory flexibility regarding the terms of direct access and SBX Bowen DMarina del Rey and ABX Kelley RIdyllwil d are the competing vehicles for how exit fees should be calculated LOCKYER CONVENES NEW GRAND JURY ON ALLEGED PRICE GOUGING California Attorney General Bill Lockyer appointed new members to a Sacramento County Grand Jury this week to consider the growing volume of evidence from both sides on the continuing investigations of alleged price gouging by power generators The Grand Jury to be convened later this week will be issuing subpoenas for testimony and documents and is expected to be impaneled for several months In a related development Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews reportedly will introduce two new whistleblowers a t the state capitol on Thursday from a San Diego power plant Recent testimony fr om three employees before a legislative committee investigating charges of wrongdoing on the part of a San Diego power plant claimed their employer Duke Energy manipulated the supply of electricity from the plant to increa se the companys profits In response generators have produced documents showing they were simply following the direction from the State Independent System Operator to modify their electricity output WINDFALL PROFITS TAX LEGISLATION TO BE CONSIDERED SBX Soto DPomona would impose a windfall profits tax on elect rical power generators and is scheduled for hearing on Monday July th in the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee CMTA opposes the bill SBX pertains to all types of electricity generation including cogeneration produced and sold by manufacturers and generation by other qualified facilities such as biomass and solar plants It causes the excess profit to be confiscated by the state from a middleman in th e supply chain a tax This revenue is then distributed to individual taxpayer s but not to business taxpayers who paid the middleman the excess in the fir st place The bill is a stateimposed price cap Excess profit is defined as anythin g exceeding a costbased rate established by the PUC on a plantbyplant basis If enacted SBX would have almost no effect on merchant generators as most of them have entered into contracts with the state that pass on the cost of any increased taxes to the state Furthermore this legislation would violate federal law which preempts state law in this area In accordance with the federal law the PUC has set the price at which cogenerators and other QFs can sell their energy It is the cost that the utility would have charged had it performed the sale This formula was devised to encourage manufacturers to build onsite generation and sell excess power for public use This formula did not guarantee a profit for such generators but gave them an incentive to build generation facilities a nd operate efficiently Changing the formula would result in manufacturers refusing to build more generation facilities and increased litigation costs until the courts wipe away SBX Soto LIABILITY FOR ELECTRICAL NONGENERATION CMTA strongly opposed ABX Reyes DFresno which would make any retail or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility strictly liable for a ny damages proximately caused by that generators reduction or discontinuance of service for economic reasons Neither negligence nor intent must be proven in order to establish strict liability Under this legislation a generator could be held strictly liab le for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors ie the high cost of fuel ABX also would make it difficult for a generator t o permanently close a facility even if the facility was not operating profitably Generators are only one component of many that work together to provide reliable electricity supplies throughout the State However ABX would result in generators shouldering the responsibility for all damages liability and responsibility for electricity shortages Amendments were taken to remove cogeneration from the bill However CMTA will continue to oppose the measure on the principal that imposing strict liability on generators will only discourage generators from siting new facilities and selling their electricity within the State The measure passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July and next will be heard in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee STREAMLINING THE PIPELINE PERMITTING PROCESS The CMTA is supporting ABX Diaz DSan Jose which would increase the financial threshold necessary to obtain a Public Utilities Commission PUC Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity CPCN from million to million Increasing this threshold will allow for expedited construction of new natural gas pipelines and will help to shore up the infrastructure needed to increase the States natural gas capacity The measure also streamlines the permitting process for new pipeline construction requiring the PUC to act on a permit request within months of receiving a completed application Failure to act on the permit would result in the automatic issuance of a CPCN Natural gas is a necessary component of many CMTA members industrial an d manufacturing operations Given the States heavy reliance on imported natural gas CMTA supports expediting the construction of new pipelines to ensure that a sufficient supply of this critical fuel is available for use REPORTING TO THE EOB MAY OPEN RECORDS FOR PUBLIC REVIEW A measure that allows the Energy Oversight Board EOB to inspect and make public all of a facilitys records data accounts books or documents related to reliability availability and the cost of electric service was heard in the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on June CMTA testified in opposition to ABX Migden DSan Francisco which substantially expands the authority of the Independent System Operator ISO to adopt operating and availability standards for electricity generation an d transmission ABX also would allow the ISO to regulate a facilitys cogeneration scheduling and maintenance practices which would have the practical effect of giving the ISO regulatory authority over a business primary industri al operations Since many of the cogeneration facilities do not keep separate records for the electricity component of their facilities this requirement could open up much of the facilitys private operational records for their competitors and public review Committee members expressed concern regarding the effect of expanding the authority of the Energy Oversight Board how the measure affects the handli ng of documents subject to the Public Records Act and clarification regarding the purpose for which documents would be used The measure was subject to testimony and discussion however a vote was not taken The measure will again be heard on July NEW FISHING LIMITS FOR REGIONAL WATER BOARDS In late May Assemblymember Fran Pavleys DAgoura Hills AB whic h makes various changes to state and regional water board penalty authority was amended on the Assembly Floor to remove language that would have create d major new penalty exposures for manufacturers Shortly thereafter questio ns surfaced concerning a subtle change to a section of the water code that grants authority to the regional boards to issue orders for investigation o f waste discharges The concern pertains to the ability of the regional boar ds to issue investigation orders to parties suspected of having discharged waste at some point in the past Orders issued under these circumstances typically involve contentious property access issues and costly monitoring requirements This section of the code is already used liberally by the regional boards and the change in AB arguably invites more orders that lack a clear nexus between the dischargers past activities and the susp ected discharge AB was amended earlier this week in Senate Environmental Quality Committee to address this issue The bills sponsor the State Water Resources Control Board and Assemblymember Pavley agreed to take language requiring that any new investigation order be accompanied by a written statement identifying the evidence upon which the order is based This clarification applies to all circumstances under which investigation orders are issued and should help to ensure that regional boards do not abuse this authority CALOSH STANDARDS BOARD TO CONSIDER ERGONOMIC RULE On the agenda for the July meeting in San Diego the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board Standards Board will consider a petition from organized labor to adopt the recently overturned federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule as a state rule for California If adopted it would replace Californias repetitive motion standard Title CCR Employers opposed the federal rule because most employers believed it was based on dubious science that could not accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion injuries attributable to work The federal rule containe d restrictions that would prohibit doctors from providing information on nonoccupational causation of injury that would interfere with an employer s ability to determine the compensability of a claim under California workers compensation law arising out of and in the course of employment O ther onerous provisions include Requiring employers to pay work restrictions benefits that require a or replacement rate of an injured workers gross pay and the continuation of employer provided fringe benefits for up to months in the case of a musculoskeletal disorder related to work The federal rule would have carved out a completely different standard for musculoskeletal disorders injuries due to repetitive motion with remedies substantially more costly than other injuries under the workers compens ation system CMTA is requesting that members send letters to the Standards Board or atte nd the meeting to urge board members to reject the petition Write to John MacLeod Executive Officer

publication from the California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento FRIDAY THE TH SURPRISE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES The budget impasse will keep lawmakers working over the weekend In additio n a deadline looms for a vote on the Governors Memorandum of Understandin g MOU to keep Southern California Edison SCE out of bankruptcy The Assembly and Senate Democrats are making a final run at their own versions of the plan A Senate version is still in the works while the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability will hold an informational hearing Saturday afternoo n on ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek ABX currently allocates the SCE undercollection almost entirely to noncore customers above kw pays SCE two times net book value for transmission and leaves open the possibility of a contribution from SCE above the million tax refund provided in the Governors MOU The sketchy outline of a Senate plan would impose all undercollections to noncore customers impose a million haircut to generators and an additional million from SCE Direct access rights would be suspended under ABX until and a stud y would be authorized by March on how to expeditiously phase in direct access for customers over kw and green direct access under kw Some of Californias largest businesses have already been hit with rate increases over CMTA supports an equitable sharing of the costs of th e SCE undercollection as well as DWR contract costs among all customer groups and will oppose a solution to the SCE problem that unfairly shifts these costs to California businesses MORE OR LESS ENERGY There seems to be no shortage of bad business bills making their way throug h the Legislature Issues range from imposing strict liability on generators that reduce or discontinue electricity generation to subjecting generators to felony criminal penalties for making basic costbenefit business decisions Generator Liability A measure ABX Reyes DFresno that makes an electricity generator strictly liable for any damages that are proximately caused when the generator reduces or stops generating electricity for economic reasons passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July Since negligence and intent need not be proven in order to establish strict liability under ABX a generator could be held strictly liable for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors ABX also would make it difficult for a generator to permanently close a facilit y even if the facility was not operating profitably Despite the fact that electricity shortages are driven by any number of factors within and beyond their control ABX would result in generators shouldering all liability and responsibility for electricity shortages CMTA will be actively advocating against this measure before it is heard on the Assembly Floor Felony Fuel Shortages ABX Cardoza DMerced is a vaguely worded measure that does not explicitly identify what types of activities would be considered felonious The measure allows an individual or entity to be prosecuted for creatin g a fuel shortage defined as The diminution by contrivance or artificia l means of any of the supply of fuel to a point below that needed to meet consumer demand Restricting output or withholding capacity from bidding into the market and Economic withholding by submitting bids at prices above the producers marginal costFluctuations of instate and outofstate generation maintenance of facilities weather customer demand and drought are just a few of the many components that converge to impact daytoday energy supplies ABX does not allow for the natural swings in supply and deman d which are common in a market economy and add one more unpredictable component to the market thus further complicating price and supply fluctuations In addition the bill provides that producers only should receive marginal costs for their products This precept flies in the face of a free market economy Businesses should be able to receive a reasonable return on the products they produce and supply Limiting a business profits to margi nal costs only further discourages investment in the States energy infrastructure Second entities already may be prosecuted for illegal business practices conspiracy collusion and intentional market manipulation under the State s Cartwright Act and the Federal Sherman AntiTrust Act among others Enforcement of existing state and federal laws is sufficient to address the alleged illegal business practices the bill purports to remedy Third the measure establishes that a person or entity who violates provisions of the bill is guilty of a felony and may be punished in sta te prison and a fine not to exceed percent of the corporations gross corporate assets These fines and penalties are excessively punitive Fourth the bountyhunter provisions of the bill provide an incentive for employees and interest groups to investigate businesses for profit Other bountyhunter legislation passed by the Legislature has resulted in many frivolous lawsuits Some of the costs associated with these suits are absorbed by businesses and some of the costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices In any event the bountyhunter provisions have the potential to unnecessarily increase energy costs The regulatory branc h of our government already has the authority to investigate alleged unfair business practices This authority should not be passed on to employees an d interest groups ABX establishes a terrible precedent and has the very real potential to reduce existing energy supplies and to discourage future energy infrastructure investment within the State Office of Ratepayer Advocate Following the charge of Pacific Bell CMTA and other business lobby groups have successfully slowed the progress of SB Speier DHillsborough whi ch repeals the sunset of the Office of Ratepayer Advocate ORA CMTA does no t oppose the continued existence of the ORA but is advocating against langua ge inserted into the measure that significantly expands the ORAs authority The ORA has exercised broad authority to supervise and regulate utilities arguably beyond the authority it was granted when it became a standalone office While there is ample legislative history in Public Utilities Code Section indicating that the ORA should be independent of the Commission the PUCs full authority was not automatically extended to t he ORA CMTA joined Pacific Bell in proposing amendments to limit the ORAs auth ority and to require the PUC to issue written orders when ruling on the ORAs discovery requests Written rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or Commissioner would provide additional information to the ORA utilities and the public explaining the basis for decisions In addition CMTA supports requiring the ORA to pursue alternative dispute resolution prior to filing a complaint Many courts today utilize alternative dispute resolution because it often leads to a more efficient disposition of cases CMTA also is supportive of extending for five more years the sunset in th e bill that the author seeks to repeal Extending the sunset will allow the Legislature to assess whether or not the original intent of the legislation has achieved its purpose SB failed passage in Utilities and Commerce on July when the author resisted amendments to narrow and clarify provisions in the bill Reconsideration was granted and the measure received a necessary rule waive r to allow the bill to be heard again by the Utilities and Commerce Committ ee on July ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE PASSES UI BENEFITS BILL SB by Senator Richard Alarcon DSylmar passed out of the Assembly Insurance Committee on July on a partisan vote The bill would increase the cost of unemployment insurance UI to employers by more than billion over four years and provides no systemic changes to help offse t the cost CMTA and other employer representatives opposed the bill An increase in unemployment benefits is a direct payroll tax that would be funded entirely by employers According to the Employment Development Departments EDD projections SB as proposed would raise employer contributions over and above the existing rates by million by given there are no changes in the unemployment rate Further it is estimated that by the total employer UI tax increase would jump to million a percent tax increase SB would increase the maximum weekl y benefit from the current level of to in to in to in based on state average weekly wage estimates The bill contains several other provisions that add costs to employers such as an alternate base period using the most recent weeks of the benefit year that will allow six to eight percent more applicants to qualify for UI benefits This would be a new system in addition to the current quarterly reporting system and would impose a new burden on employers who would have to manually report alternate base period wage information to EDD within ten da ys or pay a civil penalty It would also entitle employees who leave the ir job during a trade dispute caused by a reduction in wages and employees lockedout of work by the employer during a collective bargaining dispute t o receive UI benefits anyway The federal Worker Adjustment and Renotification and Training Act WARN requires an employer of or more employees to give at least a day notice in plant closings or mass layoffs affecting or more employees I f the employer fails to provide a WARN notice they are liable for civil damages in the amount of days of back pay and benefits to each affected worker Some employers elect to not give the advance notice and pay the days and benefits in order to avoid possible problems with product quality equipment sabotage poor attendance injuries and etc However the upside to this decision is that employees get days in which to look for work fu ll time with full pay and benefits SB would allow these employees to collect UI benefits during the same days Californias UI maximum weekly benefit of is the fifth lowest in th e nation and has not been increased since However California has the most liberal eligibility requirement of any state by almost any measure and in order to maintain any reasonable control on UI cost the historical tradeoff has been workers receiving lower benefits The above provisions a re good examples of how the system can be abused and must be resisted by employers CMTA along with other employer representatives are in serious discussion wi th the proponents of SB to determine how to increase the benefit level and make some modest systemic changes that will help avoid placing an undue hardship on employers Further discussions are being scheduled STORMWATER BILL PUT OVER Late last week Senator Kuehls office circulated a negotiated compromis e on the stormwater monitoring bill SB Kuehl DSanta Monica Based on tha t version the business community and the municipalities were prepared to remove their opposition earlier this week in the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee However the evening before the hearing the bills sponsor Heal the Bay circulated a new set of amend ments to Committee members Their version deletes several sections of the bill including carefully crafted language intended to preserve and strengthen group monitoring programs It also creates the potential for expanded monitoring requirements for industrial facilities Heal the Bays action created an atmosphere of confusion and frustration that lead Senator Kuehl and Committee Chair HannahBeth Jackson to hold the bill in committee In all probability a rule waiver will be secured for an August hearing in Assembly Toxics In the meantime discussions will resum e on Heal the Bays proposed changes CMTA remains hopeful that the outstanding issues mentioned above can be resolved without sacrificing the progress achieved over several weeks of negotiation CMTA ADVOCATES FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING CMTA has formally urged that million dollars be allocated in the State Budget for Career and Technical Education CTE also known as vocational education At the outset of this session legislative leaders stated that CTE was one of the highest education priorities for the year Unfortunatel y the Governor eliminated funding for CTE in the May Revise and the Budget Subcommittees subsequently funded only million for an unallocated fund In the past decade more than half of the career technical education progra ms faced closure in the Los Angeles Unified School District because of lack of funding and support statewide the trend has been the same Without new funding this year more programs will close The acquisition of marketabl e skills in high school offers students both those who are college bound and those who will immediately enter the workforce the opportunity to earn hig h salaries and engage in meaningful careers CMTA continues to support legislation designed to rebuild Californias CTEvocational education sy stem UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY A recent report from the California Department of Finance confirms that the states economy does not seem destined to repeat its extraordinary performance this year Employment growth slowed significantly during the first five months of The slowdown is principally centered in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the dramatic contraction in internetrelated service industries Below are data supporting the reports conclusions Californias employment picture has changed notably since the end of In May industry employment grew by following gains of in Apri l and nearly in March Thus far in industry employment has expanded by an average of jobs each month compared to an average of jobs each month in Despite decelerating job growth California is still the nations growth leader While the state added over jobs in May nationally nonfarm employment fell by Since the beginning of the year California has accounted for percent of the nations new nonfarm jobs Californias unemployment rate was unchanged in May at percent The ra te a year ago was percent While still low by state and national standard s the unemployment rate of all San Francisco Bay Area counties rose in May Computer servicesheavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area are bearing the brunt of the employment slowdown Business service employment which includes computer programming and personnel supply servicesgrew b y nearly jobs per month in but has averaged only a month thus far in Within business services the growth rate of computer service s employment has been cut in half Yearoveryear industry employment growth in the San Jose Metropolitan Areathe Silicon

Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento GOVERNOR SIGNS BUDGET The Budget passed by the Legislature was signed by the Governor thi s afternoon July The amount of the total Budget is approximately billion of which about billion is the general fund the balance is special funds The bulk of General Fund spending is allocated approximately as follows billion K Education billion Health and Human Services billion Higher Education billion Youth and Adult Correctional The balance is spent on expenses attributable to programs relating to business transportation and housing state and consumer services environmental protection to the courts and to tax relief In addition Health and Human Services receive the largest portion of speci al funds Tax relief in the version passed by the Legislature was very insignifican t the lions share was million for assistance to low income seniors an d disabled persons A total of about million was to go to salesuse tax exemptions for purchases of liquefied petroleum used for residential or harvesting use million diesel fuel used for agriculture or food processing million farming equipment million timber equipment million racehorse breeding stock million In order to pass the budget legislation the Legislature also made a deal whereby a Constitutional amendment will be sent to the voters regarding permanent allocation of a portion of gasoline sales tax revenues to transportation purposes They also agreed to suspend a of the general sales tax in any year as of in which the General Fund reserve is determined to exceed existing law sets as the trigger See CMTAs Press Release on the Budget pressbudgetshtml SCE BAILOUT UPDATE The latest Assembly version of the proposed Southern California Edison SCE bailout legislation was revealed this week in proposed amendments to ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek and SBX Sher DStanford CMTA opposes this package as unfairly shifting the cost of SCE debt onto business In addition direct access options may be severely limited as th e Department of Water Resources DWR continues to enter into long term contracts for supply and the utilities may construct new generation The bills may be heard after August or earlier on the call of the Speaker CMTA urges you to contact legislators about the impact of high energy price s on your business and concern about taking on any more costs Elements of the package SCE Debt Payment Total billion debt allocated as follows billion to be collected from small and from large customers The demand level division between small and large is yet to be determined billion is left for SCE to recover from large generators million tax refund from SCE parent No transmission system purchase or option Direct Access Allowed without payment of exit fees after January so long as there is more demand for power than can be served by SCE native generation and DWR contracts Green power deals allowed for small residenti al and commercial customers immediately Ratepayer Benefit Account Positive balances in the account that includes refunds ordered by FERC litigation proceeds and DWR Power fund revenues would go to customers in refunds in proportion to the March CPUC rate increase Renewable Portfolio Standard Sets a target of renewable power in through requirements to purchase renewable power for resale SCE Financials CPUC cannot lower SCE rate of return before SCE may be required by the CPUC to construct new generation under costbased ratemakin g CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON ENERGY PRODUCERS CMTA and other interested parties met with staff from the offices of Assemblymember Dennis Cardoza and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to discuss onerous provisions in ABX Cardoza DMerced that would impose severe criminal penalties on energy producers Amendments taken in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July delete references to petroleum products coal and coal products and limit the bil l to apply to electricity and natural gas While no specific agreement was reached the staff indicated that the author would consider amending the measure to more narrowly focus the penalty provisions of the bill ABX passed from the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July and will be taken up on the Assembly Floor when the Legislature reconvenes from its Summer Recess OVERPAYMENT REFUNDS TO PAY FOR TRANSMISSION LINE UPGRADES Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno has amended her ABX to use any overpayment refunds ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC for payment of principal and interest on bonds to upgrade electrici ty transmission lines and to reimburse ratepayers CMTA and the California Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on July asserting tha t percent of the refunds should proportionately be returned to the ratepayers who have shouldered the burden of elevated energy prices As introduced ABX required percent of the overpayment to be returne d to ratepayers and percent to be deposited into the General Fund ABX passed to the Assembly Appropriations Committee EXIT FEES ON NONCORE GAS CUSTOMERS CMTA and other business groups are working with Assemblymember Pescetti RRancho Cordova during the Legislatures Summer Recess to amend his A BX which imposes exit fees on noncore gas customers The measure also expedites the review process for approval of gas facilitie s and requires pipelines within the state to meet the test that every custome r would expect to be curtailed not more than once every ten years which increases the current standard of once every five years INITIATIVE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES CLEARED FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING A ballot initiative to expand the entities that can buy and sell natural ga s has been approved for signature gathering by the Secretary of State The measure would allow cities counties municipal utilities and irrigation districts to buy and sell natural gas and be exempt from the oversight of t he California Public Utilities Commission Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced is the sponsor of the initiative Supporters expect that if passed the measure would increase competition an d lower gas and electricity prices for consumers The sponsors need to collec t the signatures of registered voters by October to qualify for the March ballot This may be the first of several initiatives for the election seeking to address the states energy crisis According to a public opinion poll recently released by the Public Policy Institute of California residents b y a twotoone margin say questions of how to address the electricity crisis should be decided not by the legislature and governor but by voter s through state ballot initiatives in FEDOSHA HOLDS PUBLIC FORUM ON ERGONOMICS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY The Department of Labor held the third and final public forum on ergonomics at Stanford University in Palo Alto on July Following the repeal of th e federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule by Congres s Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao promised that public forums would be held i n several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard The forum follows a major victory for California employers when on July the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously rejected a petition from organized labor to adopt the overturned federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule The forum began with opening remarks by Assistant Secretary of Labor Chris Spear who explained the purpose of the meeting and Secretary Chao expressed interest in trying to obtain the best information and ideas available Federal OSHA requested that comments be focused on three questions What is an ergonomic injury How can the Occupational Safety and Health Administration employers and employees determine whether an ergonomic inju ry was caused by workrelated activities or nonworkrelated activities and if the ergonomics injury was caused by a combination of the two what is the appropriate response and What are the most useful and costeffective types of government involvement to address workplace ergonomics injuries eg rulemaking guidelines best practices publicationsconferences technical assistance consultation partnerships or combinations of such approaches Panels began with organized labor representatives who criticized the repeal of the ergonomic rule and urged the Secretary to quickly adopt new rules to protect workers The second panel was made up largely of educators and scientists who have studied the ergonomics issue extensively and believe th at the science does not justify an ergonomic standard such as the federal OSHA rule The third and final panel was a mixture of employers employer associations medical professionals organized labor university representatives professional safety organizations and individuals which provided vastly contrasting views on the merits of ergonomics rules in the workplace Employers resisted the federal rule stating that it was based on dubious science that cannot accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion injuries attributable to work Further employers stressed that California already has the only ergonomic regulation Title CCR and the only illness and injury prevention program Title CCR in the nation already protecting California workers Hopefully Secretary Chao will take a closer look at employers concerns and the lack of credible science before deciding what if any new federal rules or guidance is needed in the workplace ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AT THE BREAK The week of August promises to be a busy one with several measures scheduled for late policy committee hearings Among them SB Senator Sheila Kuehls DSanta Monica stormwater monitoring bill which was pu t over in Assembly Environmental Safety following a lastminute push for majo r amendments by bill sponsor Heal the Bay It is unclear at this time what form the bill will take for the August hearing AB a controversial environmental justice measure by Assemblymember Marco Firebaugh DEast Los Angeles will be heard in Senate Environmental Quality AB is predeterminative of the statelevel program reviews required by SB Solis and SB Escutia Cleanup language on the states greenhouse gas registry program establi shed last year by SB Sher is now in limbo following Senator Shers DStanford decision to use SB for a renewable energy initiative The cleanup language may resurface toward the end of session not unlike the SB registry program language Among significant late entries in the environmental arena include SB Sher discussed in last weeks Legislative Weekly amended on J uly with Proposition language and passed out of Assembly Environmental Safet y on July The bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for the same alleged violation even in the face of a courtapproved settlement AB Lowenthal DLong Beach last amended on June and again on July to place further restrictions on handling and treatment of oily wastewater To quote the Senate Environmental Quality Committee analysis the sponsors hazardous waste treatment facility operators have not provided any information that demonstrates they are solving an environmental protection problem Moreover their proposal has the effect of reserving the market for offsite oilwastewater treatment to themselves ABX Daucher RBrea Hollingsworth RMurrieta last amended on July creates a voluntary environmental dispatch program for backup generators The intent of the bill is to help stabilize the grid when a rotating outage is imminent by deploying the cleanest backup units first Interestingly despite the lack of outages during the critical months of May and June thi s bill is getting political traction passing out of Assembly Energy Costs an d Availability on July on a vote Of course there is still plenty of opportunity for lastminute mischief perhaps more so this year than in past years if the energy crisis continues to dissipate and attention turns to other matters wwwcmtanet California

Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento ENERGY CASUALTY REPORT CMTAs new Energy Casualty Report describes the impact of the massive electricity rate increase imposed on California business customers of PGE and SCE The rate increase went into effect June and some customers are now receiving bills over higher than the same time last year This has led many to question their ability to continue doing business in California Layoffs canceled expansion plans increased product prices and plant closures are already occurring CMTA plans to issue the report on at least a monthly basis until further notice The Energy Casualty Report is available online at wwwcmtanet To include your story for future issues contact Gino DiCaro at ENVIRONMENTAL DISPATCH CONCEPT FOR BACKUP GENERATORS GETS TRACTION In an effort to reduce the likelihood of blackouts Assemblymember Dennis Hollingsworth RMurrieta has introduced a measure ABx to establish a voluntary program in which stationary and portable backup generators would be called upon to relieve load from the grid Under provisions of the bill a customer voluntarily would register a stationary or portable backup generator for the program The California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission CEC in cooperation with the investorowned utilities municipal utility districts and air districts would evaluate and rank these generators by level of oxides of nitrogen NOx and particulate matter PM emitted The type of fuel on which the generator operates also would be considered in the following order natural gas liquefied petroleum gas gasoline and diesel Participating operators would enter into agreements with investorowned utilities or municipal utilities to provide energy to that utility when the Independent System Operator ISO determines that a blackout is imminent Upon such determination utilities would contact participants starting with the cleanest units first Participants would be paid cents per kilowatt hour regardless of whether the electricity produced was used to offset the electricity demands of the facility at which the generator is operated or used to generate additional power for the utility ABX was heard by the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on July At that hearing a member of the committee expressed concern that the measure would unnecessarily increase air pollution The author responded that the bill would have the opposite effect by targeting the cleanest burning generators to help prevent blackouts He further stated that when a blackout does occur all forms of backup generators are allowed to run which could have a far more detrimental impact on air quality than dispatching cleanerburning generators just prior to a blackout This measure is similar to the San Diego Gas and Electric Rolling Blackout Reduction Program recently approved by the California Public Utilities Commission PUC Under the PUC order backup generators may be called into service based on their fuel type during a Stage III alert Despite the virtual absence of blackouts during May June and the first half of July ABX passed the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee CMTA agrees that environmental dispatch is a reasonable shortterm policy given the tenuous balance between energy supply and demand The bill will be heard in the Assembly Appropriations Committee when the Legislature reconvenes from its Summer Recess WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS BILL SET FOR HEARING CMTA and other employer representatives attended a scheduled meeting with Legislative staffers representing the Assembly Insurance committee Senate Labor and Industrial Relations committee and Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton on August to discuss SB Burton DSan Francisco the socalled Workers Compensation benefits bill The purpose of the meeting was to provide employers with a verbal briefing on amendments to SB The meeting with employers was the last of several meetings held by staff with insurers organized labor applicant attorneys medical providers and others No language was provided for the briefing and language is expected to be in print by the end of this week The bill as amended is set to be heard in Assembly Insurance Committee on August and a long and contentious hearing is expected The main changes discussed in the meeting were Benefit Increases The benefit increases about billion in SB Johnston that were vetoed last year will be the basis for the benefit increases in SB In addition there will be an adjustment of the life pension increasing the benefit from its levels in an amount equal to the increase in the statewide average weekly wage SAWW since and indexed annually to SAWW increases thereafter Issues regarding phasing of benefits over time and in regards to system improvements are open for further discussion Commission Recommendations Staff agreed to adopt all substantive recommendations from the Commission on Safety and Health and Workers Compensation CSHWC that were noncontroversial verbatim For details on the recommendations go to the Commissions web site at CHSWCchswchtml In addition staff indicated that a oneyear statute of limitations applicable to provider liens would also be added to the bill Medical Cost Control The focus of medical cost containment will be on the development of treatment guidelines within three years by the Industrial Medical Council The guidelines will reference national standards including best practices but will likely not have to be based on them The guidelines will be admissible before the Workers Compensation Appeals Board WCAB but may not be sufficient to rebut the presumption for predesignated physicians Obviously this will need further clarification as the process moves forward The Health Care Organization HCO program will be retained but additional quality of care reporting and surveillance by a yet to be determined entity will be required More training will be required for treating physicians along with a system of tracking quality of care and utilization by treaters Treating Physician Presumption SB language is included which retains the presumption for predesignated physicians but repeals the presumption for all other treaters This is clearly an open issue for many It is also not clear whether the medicallegal changes in SB will also be in the amended bill Administrative Issues The court administrator remains in the bill In addition there will be language easing the penalty problems associated with checks payable on demand and further facilitating electronic deposit of indemnity checks Obviously many items of interest to employers did not make the list such as objective medical evaluations vocational rehabilitation and penalties under LC Sections and to name a few Nor was insurers desire to eliminate consultation services to insured employers and replace it with a puff safety education program that CMTA opposes discussed And finally the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations has not talked to the Legislative staffers about their interests in workers compensation changes so everyone is waiting for them to weigh in Clearly there are no significant changes proposed in SB that would help offset the cost of increased benefit to employers and streamline the system to make it more efficient However we think issues may be brought up later if other parties of interest are amenable and may be added to the bill In order to coordinate this information with the enrolled version of SB go to and look under the year CMTA DEFENDS COMMERCIAL LEGAL RIGHTS FOR MANUFACTURERS CMTA has formally urged The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws NCCUSL to reject pending amendments to Uniform Commercial Code UCC Articles General Provisions and Sales NCCUSL will make its decision on August The proposed changes affect all of our companies but most especially those engaged in ecommerce As is true for the law in most states Californias Commercial Code and much of its Civil Code are based on the UCC and govern the perimeters of almost all commercial transactions conducted between businesses and between businesses and consumers If NCCUSL passes the amendments CMTA would expect to see conforming legislation here next year The purpose of a uniform code is to provide a model for states to adopt as they modernize their laws and to promote uniformity among the states Both features are highly desirable however the purpose behind many of the proposed changes appears to be abstract experimentation in creating new consumer rights and taking away traditional rights enjoyed by sellers Moreover the changes also introduce numerous ambiguities which would engender litigation Furthermore their antibusiness slant will prove controversial in state legislatures leading to only partial adoption and conflict among the codes Manufacturers technology companies and others engaged in sales and leases of goods rely on settled contract law and the certainties it provides As CMTA has explained to NCCUSAL commercial laws should facilitate commerce address real world situations be articulated clearly and be as uniform as possible Among the objectionable revisions are creation of a basis for liability for advertising and other public communications even if the buyer did not purchase from the entity that made the advertisement or communication elimination of a sellers right to full compensation for loss where a consumer buyers breach causes consequential damages to the seller elimination of clarifying language that laws governing sales and leases do not apply to computer information transactionslicenses of information creation of noncontractual nonprivity obligations based on a remote manufacturers statements about a product contained in or with the product even if the statements were not part of the contractual bargain and there is no contract privity a grant of power to judges to override the effect of any UCC section to any court decision that creates a different rule for consumers and arrogation of the right to use choice of law provisions particularly where the consumers local law affords greater consumer protection rights The foregoing is a short sample If the draft is adopted California businesses will soon be acquainted with the longer list when new conforming legislation is introduced in January wwwcmtanet California Manufacturers Technology Association th Street Suite

California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento GOVERNOR SIGNS BUDGET The Budget passed by the Legislature was signed by the Governor this afternoon July The amount of the total Budget is approximately billion of which about billion is the general fund the balance is special funds The bulk of General Fund spending is allocated approximately as follows billion K Education billion Health and Human Services billion Higher Education billion Youth and Adult Correctional The balance is spent on expenses attributable to programs relating to business transportation and housing state and consumer services environmental protection to the courts and to tax relief In addition Health and Human Services receive the largest portion of special funds Tax relief in the version passed by the Legislature was very insignificant the lions share was million for assistance to low income seniors and disabled persons A total of about million was to go to salesuse tax exemptions for purchases of liquefied petroleum used for residential or harvesting use million diesel fuel used for agriculture or food processing million farming equipment million timber equipment million racehorse breeding stock million In order to pass the budget legislation the Legislature also made a deal whereby a Constitutional amendment will be sent to the voters regarding permanent allocation of a portion of gasoline sales tax revenues to transportation purposes They also agreed to suspend a of the general sales tax in any year as of in which the General Fund reserve is determined to exceed existing law sets as the trigger See CMTAs Press Release on the Budget pressbudgetshtml SCE BAILOUT UPDATE The latest Assembly version of the proposed Southern California Edison SCE bailout legislation was revealed this week in proposed amendments to ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek and SBX Sher DStanford CMTA opposes this package as unfairly shifting the cost of SCE debt onto business In addition direct access options may be severely limited as the Department of Water Resources DWR continues to enter into long term contracts for supply and the utilities may construct new generation The bills may be heard after August or earlier on the call of the Speaker CMTA urges you to contact legislators about the impact of high energy prices on your business and concern about taking on any more costs Elements of the package SCE Debt Payment Total billion debt allocated as follows billion to be collected from small and from large customers The demand level division between small and large is yet to be determined billion is left for SCE to recover from large generators million tax refund from SCE parent No transmission system purchase or option Direct Access Allowed without payment of exit fees after January so long as there is more demand for power than can be served by SCE native generation and DWR contracts Green power deals allowed for small residential and commercial customers immediately Ratepayer Benefit Account Positive balances in the account that includes refunds ordered by FERC litigation proceeds and DWR Power fund revenues would go to customers in refunds in proportion to the March CPUC rate increase Renewable Portfolio Standard Sets a target of renewable power in through requirements to purchase renewable power for resale SCE Financials CPUC cannot lower SCE rate of return before SCE may be required by the CPUC to construct new generation under costbased ratemaking CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON ENERGY PRODUCERS CMTA and other interested parties met with staff from the offices of Assemblymember Dennis Cardoza and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to discuss onerous provisions in ABX Cardoza DMerced that would impose severe criminal penalties on energy producers Amendments taken in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July delete references to petroleum products coal and coal products and limit the bill to apply to electricity and natural gas While no specific agreement was reached the staff indicated that the author would consider amending the measure to more narrowly focus the penalty provisions of the bill ABX passed from the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July and will be taken up on the Assembly Floor when the Legislature reconvenes from its Summer Recess OVERPAYMENT REFUNDS TO PAY FOR TRANSMISSION LINE UPGRADES Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno has amended her ABX to use any overpayment refunds ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC for payment of principal and interest on bonds to upgrade electricity transmission lines and to reimburse ratepayers CMTA and the California Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on July asserting that percent of the refunds should proportionately be returned to the ratepayers who have shouldered the burden of elevated energy prices As introduced ABX required percent of the overpayment to be returned to ratepayers and percent to be deposited into the General Fund ABX passed to the Assembly Appropriations Committee EXIT FEES ON NONCORE GAS CUSTOMERS CMTA and other business groups are working with Assemblymember Pescetti RRancho Cordova during the Legislatures Summer Recess to amend his ABX which imposes exit fees on noncore gas customers The measure also expedites the review process for approval of gas facilities and requires pipelines within the state to meet the test that every customer would expect to be curtailed not more than once every ten years which increases the current standard of once every five years INITIATIVE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES CLEARED FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING A ballot initiative to expand the entities that can buy and sell natural gas has been approved for signature gathering by the Secretary of State The measure would allow cities counties municipal utilities and irrigation districts to buy and sell natural gas and be exempt from the oversight of the California Public Utilities Commission Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced is the sponsor of the initiative Supporters expect that if passed the measure would increase competition and lower gas and electricity prices for consumers The sponsors need to collect the signatures of registered voters by October to qualify for the March ballot This may be the first of several initiatives for the election seeking to address the states energy crisis According to a public opinion poll recently released by the Public Policy Institute of California residents by a twotoone margin say questions of how to address the electricity crisis should be decided not by the legislature and governor but by voters through state ballot initiatives in FEDOSHA HOLDS PUBLIC FORUM ON ERGONOMICS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY The Department of Labor held the third and final public forum on ergonomics at Stanford University in Palo Alto on July Following the repeal of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule by Congress Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao promised that public forums would be held in several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard The forum follows a major victory for California employers when on July the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously rejected a petition from organized labor to adopt the overturned federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule The forum began with opening remarks by Assistant Secretary of Labor Chris Spear who explained the purpose of the meeting and Secretary Chao expressed interest in trying to obtain the best information and ideas available Federal OSHA requested that comments be focused on three questions What is an ergonomic injury How can the Occupational Safety and Health Administration employers and employees determine whether an ergonomic injury was caused by workrelated activities or nonworkrelated activities and if the ergonomics injury was caused by a combination of the two what is the appropriate response and What are the most useful and costeffective types of government involvement to address workplace ergonomics injuries eg rulemaking guidelines best practices publicationsconferences technical assistance consultation partnerships or combinations of such approaches Panels began with organized labor representatives who criticized the repeal of the ergonomic rule and urged the Secretary to quickly adopt new rules to protect workers The second panel was made up largely of educators and scientists who have studied the ergonomics issue extensively and believe that the science does not justify an ergonomic standard such as the federal OSHA rule The third and final panel was a mixture of employers employer associations medical professionals organized labor university representatives professional safety organizations and individuals which provided vastly contrasting views on the merits of ergonomics rules in the workplace Employers resisted the federal rule stating that it was based on dubious science that cannot accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion injuries attributable to work Further employers stressed that California already has the only ergonomic regulation Title CCR and the only illness and injury prevention program Title CCR in the nation already protecting California workers Hopefully Secretary Chao will take a closer look at employers concerns and the lack of credible science before deciding what if any new federal rules or guidance is needed in the workplace ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AT THE BREAK The week of August promises to be a busy one with several measures scheduled for late policy committee hearings Among them SB Senator Sheila Kuehls DSanta Monica stormwater monitoring bill which was put over in Assembly Environmental Safety following a lastminute push for major amendments by bill sponsor Heal the Bay It is unclear at this time what form the bill will take for the August hearing AB a controversial environmental justice measure by Assemblymember Marco Firebaugh DEast Los Angeles will be heard in Senate Environmental Quality AB is predeterminative of the statelevel program reviews required by SB Solis and SB Escutia Cleanup language on the states greenhouse gas registry program established last year by SB Sher is now in limbo following Senator Shers DStanford decision to use SB for a renewable energy initiative The cleanup language may resurface toward the end of session not unlike the SB registry program language Among significant late entries in the environmental arena include SB Sher discussed in last weeks Legislative Weekly amended on July with Proposition language and passed out of Assembly Environmental Safety on July The bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for the same alleged violation even in the face of a courtapproved settlement AB Lowenthal DLong Beach last amended on June and again on July to place further restrictions on handling and treatment of oily wastewater To quote the Senate Environmental Quality Committee analysis the sponsors hazardous waste treatment facility operators have not provided any information that demonstrates they are solving an environmental protection problem Moreover their proposal has the effect of reserving the market for offsite oilwastewater treatment to themselves ABX Daucher RBrea Hollingsworth RMurrieta last amended on July creates a voluntary environmental dispatch program for backup generators The intent of the bill is to help stabilize the grid when a rotating outage is imminent by deploying the cleanest backup units first Interestingly despite the lack of outages during the critical months of May and June this bill is getting political traction passing out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability on July on a vote Of course there is still plenty of opportunity for lastminute mischief perhaps more so this year than in past years if the energy crisis continues to dissipate and attention turns to other matters wwwcmtanet California Manufacturers Technology

A weekly publication from the California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento FRIDAY THE TH SURPRISE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES The budget impasse will keep lawmakers working over the weekend In addition a deadline looms for a vote on the Governors Memorandum of Understanding MOU to keep Southern California Edison SCE out of bankruptcy The Assembly and Senate Democrats are making a final run at their own versions of the plan A Senate version is still in the works while the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability will hold an informational hearing Saturday afternoon on ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek ABX currently allocates the SCE undercollection almost entirely to noncore customers above kw pays SCE two times net book value for transmission and leaves open the possibility of a contribution from SCE above the million tax refund provided in the Governors MOU The sketchy outline of a Senate plan would impose all undercollections to noncore customers impose a million haircut to generators and an additional million from SCE Direct access rights would be suspended under ABX until and a study would be authorized by March on how to expeditiously phase in direct access for customers over kw and green direct access under kw Some of Californias largest businesses have already been hit with rate increases over CMTA supports an equitable sharing of the costs of the SCE undercollection as well as DWR contract costs among all customer groups and will oppose a solution to the SCE problem that unfairly shifts these costs to California businesses MORE OR LESS ENERGY There seems to be no shortage of bad business bills making their way through the Legislature Issues range from imposing strict liability on generators that reduce or discontinue electricity generation to subjecting generators to felony criminal penalties for making basic costbenefit business decisions Generator Liability A measure ABX Reyes DFresno that makes an electricity generator strictly liable for any damages that are proximately caused when the generator reduces or stops generating electricity for economic reasons passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July Since negligence and intent need not be proven in order to establish strict liability under ABX a generator could be held strictly liable for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors ABX also would make it difficult for a generator to permanently close a facility even if the facility was not operating profitably Despite the fact that electricity shortages are driven by any number of factors within and beyond their control ABX would result in generators shouldering all liability and responsibility for electricity shortages CMTA will be actively advocating against this measure before it is heard on the Assembly Floor Felony Fuel Shortages ABX Cardoza DMerced is a vaguely worded measure that does not explicitly identify what types of activities would be considered felonious The measure allows an individual or entity to be prosecuted for creating a fuel shortage defined as The diminution by contrivance or artificial means of any of the supply of fuel to a point below that needed to meet consumer demand Restricting output or withholding capacity from bidding into the market and Economic withholding by submitting bids at prices above the producers marginal costFluctuations of instate and outofstate generation maintenance of facilities weather customer demand and drought are just a few of the many components that converge to impact daytoday energy supplies ABX does not allow for the natural swings in supply and demand which are common in a market economy and add one more unpredictable component to the market thus further complicating price and supply fluctuations In addition the bill provides that producers only should receive marginal costs for their products This precept flies in the face of a free market economy Businesses should be able to receive a reasonable return on the products they produce and supply Limiting a business profits to marginal costs only further discourages investment in the States energy infrastructure Second entities already may be prosecuted for illegal business practices conspiracy collusion and intentional market manipulation under the States Cartwright Act and the Federal Sherman AntiTrust Act among others Enforcement of existing state and federal laws is sufficient to address the alleged illegal business practices the bill purports to remedy Third the measure establishes that a person or entity who violates provisions of the bill is guilty of a felony and may be punished in state prison and a fine not to exceed percent of the corporations gross corporate assets These fines and penalties are excessively punitive Fourth the bountyhunter provisions of the bill provide an incentive for employees and interest groups to investigate businesses for profit Other bountyhunter legislation passed by the Legislature has resulted in many frivolous lawsuits Some of the costs associated with these suits are absorbed by businesses and some of the costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices In any event the bountyhunter provisions have the potential to unnecessarily increase energy costs The regulatory branch of our government already has the authority to investigate alleged unfair business practices This authority should not be passed on to employees and interest groups ABX establishes a terrible precedent and has the very real potential to reduce existing energy supplies and to discourage future energy infrastructure investment within the State Office of Ratepayer Advocate Following the charge of Pacific Bell CMTA and other business lobby groups have successfully slowed the progress of SB Speier DHillsborough which repeals the sunset of the Office of Ratepayer Advocate ORA CMTA does not oppose the continued existence of the ORA but is advocating against language inserted into the measure that significantly expands the ORAs authority The ORA has exercised broad authority to supervise and regulate utilities arguably beyond the authority it was granted when it became a standalone office While there is ample legislative history in Public Utilities Code Section indicating that the ORA should be independent of the Commission the PUCs full authority was not automatically extended to the ORA CMTA joined Pacific Bell in proposing amendments to limit the ORAs authority and to require the PUC to issue written orders when ruling on the ORAs discovery requests Written rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or Commissioner would provide additional information to the ORA utilities and the public explaining the basis for decisions In addition CMTA supports requiring the ORA to pursue alternative dispute resolution prior to filing a complaint Many courts today utilize alternative dispute resolution because it often leads to a more efficient disposition of cases CMTA also is supportive of extending for five more years the sunset in the bill that the author seeks to repeal Extending the sunset will allow the Legislature to assess whether or not the original intent of the legislation has achieved its purpose SB failed passage in Utilities and Commerce on July when the author resisted amendments to narrow and clarify provisions in the bill Reconsideration was granted and the measure received a necessary rule waiver to allow the bill to be heard again by the Utilities and Commerce Committee on July ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE PASSES UI BENEFITS BILL SB by Senator Richard Alarcon DSylmar passed out of the Assembly Insurance Committee on July on a partisan vote The bill would increase the cost of unemployment insurance UI to employers by more than billion over four years and provides no systemic changes to help offset the cost CMTA and other employer representatives opposed the bill An increase in unemployment benefits is a direct payroll tax that would be funded entirely by employers According to the Employment Development Departments EDD projections SB as proposed would raise employer contributions over and above the existing rates by million by given there are no changes in the unemployment rate Further it is estimated that by the total employer UI tax increase would jump to million a percent tax increase SB would increase the maximum weekly benefit from the current level of to in to in to in based on state average weekly wage estimates The bill contains several other provisions that add costs to employers such as an alternate base period using the most recent weeks of the benefit year that will allow six to eight percent more applicants to qualify for UI benefits This would be a new system in addition to the current quarterly reporting system and would impose a new burden on employers who would have to manually report alternate base period wage information to EDD within ten days or pay a civil penalty It would also entitle employees who leave their job during a trade dispute caused by a reduction in wages and employees lockedout of work by the employer during a collective bargaining dispute to receive UI benefits anyway The federal Worker Adjustment and Renotification and Training Act WARN requires an employer of or more employees to give at least a day notice in plant closings or mass layoffs affecting or more employees If the employer fails to provide a WARN notice they are liable for civil damages in the amount of days of back pay and benefits to each affected worker Some employers elect to not give the advance notice and pay the days and benefits in order to avoid possible problems with product quality equipment sabotage poor attendance injuries and etc However the upside to this decision is that employees get days in which to look for work full time with full pay and benefits SB would allow these employees to collect UI benefits during the same days Californias UI maximum weekly benefit of is the fifth lowest in the nation and has not been increased since However California has the most liberal eligibility requirement of any state by almost any measure and in order to maintain any reasonable control on UI cost the historical tradeoff has been workers receiving lower benefits The above provisions are good examples of how the system can be abused and must be resisted by employers CMTA along with other employer representatives are in serious discussion with the proponents of SB to determine how to increase the benefit level and make some modest systemic changes that will help avoid placing an undue hardship on employers Further discussions are being scheduled STORMWATER BILL PUT OVER Late last week Senator Kuehls office circulated a negotiated compromise on the stormwater monitoring bill SB Kuehl DSanta Monica Based on that version the business community and the municipalities were prepared to remove their opposition earlier this week in the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee However the evening before the hearing the bills sponsor Heal the Bay circulated a new set of amendments to Committee members Their version deletes several sections of the bill including carefully crafted language intended to preserve and strengthen group monitoring programs It also creates the potential for expanded monitoring requirements for industrial facilities Heal the Bays action created an atmosphere of confusion and frustration that lead Senator Kuehl and Committee Chair HannahBeth Jackson to hold the bill in committee In all probability a rule waiver will be secured for an August hearing in Assembly Toxics In the meantime discussions will resume on Heal the Bays proposed changes CMTA remains hopeful that the outstanding issues mentioned above can be resolved without sacrificing the progress achieved over several weeks of negotiation CMTA ADVOCATES FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING CMTA has formally urged that million dollars be allocated in the State Budget for Career and Technical Education CTE also known as vocational education At the outset of this session legislative leaders stated that CTE was one of the highest education priorities for the year Unfortunately the Governor eliminated funding for CTE in the May Revise and the Budget Subcommittees subsequently funded only million for an unallocated fund In the past decade more than half of the career technical education programs faced closure in the Los Angeles Unified School District because of lack of funding and support statewide the trend has been the same Without new funding this year more programs will close The acquisition of marketable skills in high school offers students both those who are college bound and those who will immediately enter the workforce the opportunity to earn high salaries and engage in meaningful careers CMTA continues to support legislation designed to rebuild Californias CTEvocational education system UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY A recent report from the California Department of Finance confirms that the states economy does not seem destined to repeat its extraordinary performance this year Employment growth slowed significantly during the first five months of The slowdown is principally centered in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the dramatic contraction in internetrelated service industries Below are data supporting the reports conclusions Californias employment picture has changed notably since the end of In May industry employment grew by following gains of in April and nearly in March Thus far in industry employment has expanded by an average of jobs each month compared to an average of jobs each month in Despite decelerating job growth California is still the nations growth leader While the state added over jobs in May nationally nonfarm employment fell by Since the beginning of the year California has accounted for percent of the nations new nonfarm jobs Californias unemployment rate was unchanged in May at percent The rate a year ago was percent While still low by state and national standards the unemployment rate of all San Francisco Bay Area counties rose in May Computer servicesheavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Areaare bearing the brunt of the employment slowdown Business service employmentwhich includes computer programming and personnel supply servicesgrew by nearly jobs per month in but has averaged only a month thus far in Within business services the growth rate

th e federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule by Congres s Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao promised that public forums would be held i n several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard The forum follows a major victory for California employers when on July the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously rejected a petition

explained the purpose of the meeting and Secretary Chao expressed interest in trying to obtain the best information and ideas available Federal OSHA requested that comments be focused on three

Among them SB Senator Sheila Kuehls DSanta Monica stormwater monitoring bill which was pu t over in Assembly Environmental Safety following a lastminute push for majo r amendments by bill sponsor Heal the Bay It is unclear at this time what form the bill will take for the August hearing AB a controversial environmental justice measure by Assemblymember Marco Firebaugh DEast Los Angeles will be heard in Senate Environmental Quality AB is predeterminative of the statelevel program reviews required by SB Solis and SB Escutia Cleanup language on the states greenhouse gas registry program establi shed last year by SB Sher is now in limbo following Senator Shers DStanford decision to use SB for a renewable energy initiative The cleanup language may resurface toward the end of session not unlike the SB registry program language Among significant late entries in the environmental arena include SB Sher discussed in last weeks Legislative Weekly amended on J uly with Proposition language and passed out of Assembly Environmental Safet y on July The bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for the same alleged violation even in the face of a courtapproved settlement AB Lowenthal DLong Beach last amended on June and again on July to place further restrictions on handling and treatment of oily wastewater To quote the Senate Environmental Quality Committee analysis the sponsors hazardous waste treatment facility operators have not provided any information that demonstrates they are solving an environmental protection problem Moreover their proposal has the effect of reserving the market for offsite oilwastewater treatment to themselves ABX Daucher RBrea Hollingsworth RMurrieta last amended on July creates a voluntary environmental dispatch program for backup generators The intent of the bill is to help stabilize the grid when a rotating outage is imminent by deploying the cleanest backup units first Interestingly despite the lack of outages during the critical months of May and June thi s bill is getting political traction passing out of Assembly Energy Costs an d Availability on July on a vote Of course there is still plenty of opportunity for lastminute mischief perhaps more so this year than in past years if the energy crisis continues to dissipate and attention turns to other matters wwwcmtanet California

publication from the California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento FRIDAY THE TH SURPRISE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES The budget impasse will keep lawmakers working over the weekend In additio n a deadline looms for a vote on the Governors Memorandum of Understandin g MOU to keep Southern California Edison SCE out of bankruptcy The Assembly and Senate Democrats are making a final run at their own versions of the plan A Senate version is still in the works while the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability will hold an informational hearing Saturday afternoo n on ABX Keeley DBoulder Creek ABX currently allocates the SCE undercollection almost entirely to noncore customers above kw pays SCE two times net book value for transmission and leaves open the possibility of a contribution from SCE above the million tax refund provided in the Governors MOU The sketchy outline of a Senate plan would impose all undercollections to noncore customers impose a million haircut to generators and an additional million from SCE Direct access rights would be suspended under ABX until and a stud y would be authorized by March on how to expeditiously phase in direct access for customers over kw and green direct access under kw Some of Californias largest businesses have already been hit with rate increases over CMTA supports an equitable sharing of the costs of th e SCE undercollection as well as DWR contract costs among all customer groups and will oppose a solution to the SCE problem that unfairly shifts these costs to California businesses MORE OR LESS ENERGY There seems to be no shortage of bad business bills making their way throug h the Legislature Issues range from imposing strict liability on generators that reduce or discontinue electricity generation to subjecting generators to felony criminal penalties for making basic costbenefit business decisions Generator Liability A measure ABX Reyes DFresno that makes an electricity generator strictly liable for any damages that are proximately caused when the generator reduces or stops generating electricity for economic reasons passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July Since negligence and intent need not be proven in order to establish strict liability under ABX a generator could be held strictly liable for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors ABX also would make it difficult for a generator to permanently close a facilit y even if the facility was not operating profitably Despite the fact that electricity shortages are driven by any number of factors within and beyond their control ABX would result in generators shouldering all liability and responsibility for electricity shortages CMTA will be actively advocating against this measure before it is heard on the Assembly Floor Felony Fuel Shortages ABX Cardoza DMerced is a vaguely worded measure that does not explicitly identify what types of activities would be considered felonious The measure allows an individual or entity to be prosecuted for creatin g a fuel shortage defined as The diminution by contrivance or artificia l means of any of the supply of fuel to a point below that needed to meet consumer demand Restricting output or withholding capacity from bidding into the market and Economic withholding by submitting bids at prices above the producers marginal costFluctuations of instate and outofstate generation maintenance of facilities weather customer demand and drought are just a few of the many components that converge to impact daytoday energy supplies ABX does not allow for the natural swings in supply and deman d which are common in a market economy and add one more unpredictable component to the market thus further complicating price and supply fluctuations In addition the bill provides that producers only should receive marginal costs for their products This precept flies in the face of a free market economy Businesses should be able to receive a reasonable return on the products they produce and supply Limiting a business profits to margi nal costs only further discourages investment in the States energy infrastructure Second entities already may be prosecuted for illegal business practices conspiracy collusion and intentional market manipulation under the State s Cartwright Act and the Federal Sherman AntiTrust Act among others Enforcement of existing state and federal laws is sufficient to address the alleged illegal business practices the bill purports to remedy Third the measure establishes that a person or entity who violates provisions of the bill is guilty of a felony and may be punished in sta te prison and a fine not to exceed percent of the corporations gross corporate assets These fines and penalties are excessively punitive Fourth the bountyhunter provisions of the bill provide an incentive for employees and interest groups to investigate businesses for profit Other bountyhunter legislation passed by the Legislature has resulted in many frivolous lawsuits Some of the costs associated with these suits are absorbed by businesses and some of the costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices In any event the bountyhunter provisions have the potential to unnecessarily increase energy costs The regulatory branc h of our government already has the authority to investigate alleged unfair business practices This authority should not be passed on to employees an d interest groups ABX establishes a terrible precedent and has the very real potential to reduce existing energy supplies and to discourage future energy infrastructure investment within the State Office of Ratepayer Advocate Following the charge of Pacific Bell CMTA and other business lobby groups have successfully slowed the progress of SB Speier DHillsborough whi ch repeals the sunset of the Office of Ratepayer Advocate ORA CMTA does no t oppose the continued existence of the ORA but is advocating against langua ge inserted into the measure that significantly expands the ORAs authority The ORA has exercised broad authority to supervise and regulate utilities arguably beyond the authority it was granted when it became a standalone office While there is ample legislative history in Public Utilities Code Section indicating that the ORA should be independent of the Commission the PUCs full authority was not automatically extended to t he ORA CMTA joined Pacific Bell in proposing amendments to limit the ORAs auth ority and to require the PUC to issue written orders when ruling on the ORAs discovery requests Written rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or Commissioner would provide additional information to the ORA utilities and the public explaining the basis for decisions In addition CMTA supports requiring the ORA to pursue alternative dispute resolution prior to filing a complaint Many courts today utilize alternative dispute resolution because it often leads to a more efficient disposition of cases CMTA also is supportive of extending for five more years the sunset in th e bill that the author seeks to repeal Extending the sunset will allow the Legislature to assess whether or not the original intent of the legislation has achieved its purpose SB failed passage in Utilities and Commerce on July when the author resisted amendments to narrow and clarify provisions in the bill Reconsideration was granted and the measure received a necessary rule waive r to allow the bill to be heard again by the Utilities and Commerce Committ ee on July ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE PASSES UI BENEFITS BILL SB by Senator Richard Alarcon DSylmar passed out of the Assembly Insurance Committee on July on a partisan vote The bill would increase the cost of unemployment insurance UI to employers by more than billion over four years and provides no systemic changes to help offse t the cost CMTA and other employer representatives opposed the bill An increase in unemployment benefits is a direct payroll tax that would be funded entirely by employers According to the Employment Development Departments EDD projections SB as proposed would raise employer contributions over and above the existing rates by million by given there are no changes in the unemployment rate Further it is estimated that by the total employer UI tax increase would jump to million a percent tax increase SB would increase the maximum weekl y benefit from the current level of to in to in to in based on state average weekly wage estimates The bill contains several other provisions that add costs to employers such as an alternate base period using the most recent weeks of the benefit year that will allow six to eight percent more applicants to qualify for UI benefits This would be a new system in addition to the current quarterly reporting system and would impose a new burden on employers who would have to manually report alternate base period wage information to EDD within ten da ys or pay a civil penalty It would also entitle employees who leave the ir job during a trade dispute caused by a reduction in wages and employees lockedout of work by the employer during a collective bargaining dispute t o receive UI benefits anyway The federal Worker Adjustment and Renotification and Training Act WARN requires an employer of or more employees to give at least a day notice in plant closings or mass layoffs affecting or more employees I f the employer fails to provide a WARN notice they are liable for civil damages in the amount of days of back pay and benefits to each affected worker Some employers elect to not give the advance notice and pay the days and benefits in order to avoid possible problems with product quality equipment sabotage poor attendance injuries and etc However the upside to this decision is that employees get days in which to look for work fu ll time with full pay and benefits SB would allow these employees to collect UI benefits during the same days Californias UI maximum weekly benefit of is the fifth lowest in th e nation and has not been increased since However California has the most liberal eligibility requirement of any state by almost any measure and in order to maintain any reasonable control on UI cost the historical tradeoff has been workers receiving lower benefits The above provisions a re good examples of how the system can be abused and must be resisted by employers CMTA along with other employer representatives are in serious discussion wi th the proponents of SB to determine how to increase the benefit level and make some modest systemic changes that will help avoid placing an undue hardship on employers Further discussions are being scheduled STORMWATER BILL PUT OVER Late last week Senator Kuehls office circulated a negotiated compromis e on the stormwater monitoring bill SB Kuehl DSanta Monica Based on tha t version the business community and the municipalities were prepared to remove their opposition earlier this week in the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee However the evening before the hearing the bills sponsor Heal the Bay circulated a new set of amend ments to Committee members Their version deletes several sections of the bill including carefully crafted language intended to preserve and strengthen group monitoring programs It also creates the potential for expanded monitoring requirements for industrial facilities Heal the Bays action created an atmosphere of confusion and frustration that lead Senator Kuehl and Committee Chair HannahBeth Jackson to hold the bill in committee In all probability a rule waiver will be secured for an August hearing in Assembly Toxics In the meantime discussions will resum e on Heal the Bays proposed changes CMTA remains hopeful that the outstanding issues mentioned above can be resolved without sacrificing the progress achieved over several weeks of negotiation CMTA ADVOCATES FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING CMTA has formally urged that million dollars be allocated in the State Budget for Career and Technical Education CTE also known as vocational education At the outset of this session legislative leaders stated that CTE was one of the highest education priorities for the year Unfortunatel y the Governor eliminated funding for CTE in the May Revise and the Budget Subcommittees subsequently funded only million for an unallocated fund In the past decade more than half of the career technical education progra ms faced closure in the Los Angeles Unified School District because of lack of funding and support statewide the trend has been the same Without new funding this year more programs will close The acquisition of marketabl e skills in high school offers students both those who are college bound and those who will immediately enter the workforce the opportunity to earn hig h salaries and engage in meaningful careers CMTA continues to support legislation designed to rebuild Californias CTEvocational education sy stem UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY A recent report from the California Department of Finance confirms that the states economy does not seem destined to repeat its extraordinary performance this year Employment growth slowed significantly during the first five months of The slowdown is principally centered in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the dramatic contraction in internetrelated service industries Below are data supporting the reports conclusions Californias employment picture has changed notably since the end of In May industry employment grew by following gains of in Apri l and nearly in March Thus far in industry employment has expanded by an average of jobs each month compared to an average of jobs each month in Despite decelerating job growth California is still the nations growth leader While the state added over jobs in May nationally nonfarm employment fell by Since the beginning of the year California has accounted for percent of the nations new nonfarm jobs Californias unemployment rate was unchanged in May at percent The ra te a year ago was percent While still low by state and national standard s the unemployment rate of all San Francisco Bay Area counties rose in May Computer servicesheavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area are bearing the brunt of the employment slowdown Business service employment which includes computer programming and personnel supply servicesgrew b y nearly jobs per month in but has averaged only a month thus far in Within business services the growth rate of computer service s employment has been cut in half Yearoveryear industry employment growth in the San Jose Metropolitan Areathe Silicon Valleyhas dropped from percent in December to percent in May Growth in the San Francisco Metropolitan Area over the same period dropped from percent t o percent Californias real estate market is also

Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM Department of Water Resources Wants Money to Flow Their Way Six months ago Department of Water Resources took over power purchasing responsibility from the nearly insolvent investorowned utilities The general fund was first tapped then a shortterm loan allowed the purchasin g to continue Now the state needs to issue billion in bonds authorize d in SBX Burton DSan Francisco to be paid back by utility ratepayers for more than a decade On July the CPUC must decide how much of utility rates should be siphone d off to pay off the bonds and the ongoing costs of power being purchased on the spot market and under short and long term power contracts signed by DWR This dedicated revenue stream DRS will be based on the latest ana lysis by utility and administration financial experts The big question is whether current rates are high enough to cover all utility generation costs nuclea r qualifying facilities hydro etc DWR power costs and all the other elements of rates public purpose charges transmission and distribution etc Many assumptions about the spot market the effects of the FERC pri ce mitigation order and the level of customer demand enter into the calculatio n of the DRS Wholesale spot prices have recently dropped but there still could be a shortfall that would need to be made up in higher rates or with more borrowing to push off repayment to the future In related news last week the CPUC nearly ordered the suspension of direct access in order to ensure that customers would not be able to leave utility service and thus escape the payment of bond and DWR power costs Customer groups were able to persuade regulators to put off the decision pending legislation that could clarify a direct access customers obligation to pay a fair share of these costs To that end ABX Hertzberg DVan Nuys is being amended to make the bonds secured by the DRS rather than DWR contract s thus creating more regulatory flexibility regarding the terms of direct access and SBX Bowen DMarina del Rey and ABX Kelley RIdyllwil d are the competing vehicles for how exit fees should be calculated LOCKYER CONVENES NEW GRAND JURY ON ALLEGED PRICE GOUGING California Attorney General Bill Lockyer appointed new members to a Sacramento County Grand Jury this week to consider the growing volume of evidence from both sides on the continuing investigations of alleged price gouging by power generators The Grand Jury to be convened later this week will be issuing subpoenas for testimony and documents and is expected to be impaneled for several months In a related development Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews reportedly will introduce two new whistleblowers a t the state capitol on Thursday from a San Diego power plant Recent testimony fr om three employees before a legislative committee investigating charges of wrongdoing on the part of a San Diego power plant claimed their employer Duke Energy manipulated the supply of electricity from the plant to increa se the companys profits In response generators have produced documents showing they were simply following the direction from the State Independent System Operator to modify their electricity output WINDFALL PROFITS TAX LEGISLATION TO BE CONSIDERED SBX Soto DPomona would impose a windfall profits tax on elect rical power generators and is scheduled for hearing on Monday July th in the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee CMTA opposes the bill SBX pertains to all types of electricity generation including cogeneration produced and sold by manufacturers and generation by other qualified facilities such as biomass and solar plants It causes the excess profit to be confiscated by the state from a middleman in th e supply chain a tax This revenue is then distributed to individual taxpayer s but not to business taxpayers who paid the middleman the excess in the fir st place The bill is a stateimposed price cap Excess profit is defined as anythin g exceeding a costbased rate established by the PUC on a plantbyplant basis If enacted SBX would have almost no effect on merchant generators as most of them have entered into contracts with the state that pass on the cost of any increased taxes to the state Furthermore this legislation would violate federal law which preempts state law in this area In accordance with the federal law the PUC has set the price at which cogenerators and other QFs can sell their energy It is the cost that the utility would have charged had it performed the sale This formula was devised to encourage manufacturers to build onsite generation and sell excess power for public use This formula did not guarantee a profit for such generators but gave them an incentive to build generation facilities a nd operate efficiently Changing the formula would result in manufacturers refusing to build more generation facilities and increased litigation costs until the courts wipe away SBX Soto LIABILITY FOR ELECTRICAL NONGENERATION CMTA strongly opposed ABX Reyes DFresno which would make any retail or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility strictly liable for a ny damages proximately caused by that generators reduction or discontinuance of service for economic reasons Neither negligence nor intent must be proven in order to establish strict liability Under this legislation a generator could be held strictly liab le for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors ie the high cost of fuel ABX also would make it difficult for a generator t o permanently close a facility even if the facility was not operating profitably Generators are only one component of many that work together to provide reliable electricity supplies throughout the State However ABX would result in generators shouldering the responsibility for all damages liability and responsibility for electricity shortages Amendments were taken to remove cogeneration from the bill However CMTA will continue to oppose the measure on the principal that imposing strict liability on generators will only discourage generators from siting new facilities and selling their electricity within the State The measure passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July and next will be heard in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee STREAMLINING THE PIPELINE PERMITTING PROCESS The CMTA is supporting ABX Diaz DSan Jose which would increase the financial threshold necessary to obtain a Public Utilities Commission PUC Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity CPCN from million to million Increasing this threshold will allow for expedited construction of new natural gas pipelines and will help to shore up the infrastructure needed to increase the States natural gas capacity The measure also streamlines the permitting process for new pipeline construction requiring the PUC to act on a permit request within months of receiving a completed application Failure to act on the permit would result in the automatic issuance of a CPCN Natural gas is a necessary component of many CMTA members industrial an d manufacturing operations Given the States heavy reliance on imported natural gas CMTA supports expediting the construction of new pipelines to ensure that a sufficient supply of this critical fuel is available for use REPORTING TO THE EOB MAY OPEN RECORDS FOR PUBLIC REVIEW A measure that allows the Energy Oversight Board EOB to inspect and make public all of a facilitys records data accounts books or documents related to reliability availability and the cost of electric service was heard in the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on June CMTA testified in opposition to ABX Migden DSan Francisco which substantially expands the authority of the Independent System Operator ISO to adopt operating and availability standards for electricity generation an d transmission ABX also would allow the ISO to regulate a facilitys cogeneration scheduling and maintenance practices which would have the practical effect of giving the ISO regulatory authority over a business primary industri al operations Since many of the cogeneration facilities do not keep separate records for the electricity component of their facilities this requirement could open up much of the facilitys private operational records for their competitors and public review Committee members expressed concern regarding the effect of expanding the authority of the Energy Oversight Board how the measure affects the handli ng of documents subject to the Public Records Act and clarification regarding the purpose for which documents would be used The measure was subject to testimony and discussion however a vote was not taken The measure will again be heard on July NEW FISHING LIMITS FOR REGIONAL WATER BOARDS In late May Assemblymember Fran Pavleys DAgoura Hills AB whic h makes various changes to state and regional water board penalty authority was amended on the Assembly Floor to remove language that would have create d major new penalty exposures for manufacturers Shortly thereafter questio ns surfaced concerning a subtle change to a section of the water code that grants authority to the regional boards to issue orders for investigation o f waste discharges The concern pertains to the ability of the regional boar ds to issue investigation orders to parties suspected of having discharged waste at some point in the past Orders issued under these circumstances typically involve contentious property access issues and costly monitoring requirements This section of the code is already used liberally by the regional boards and the change in AB arguably invites more orders that lack a clear nexus between the dischargers past activities and the susp ected discharge AB was amended earlier this week in Senate Environmental Quality Committee to address this issue The bills sponsor the State Water Resources Control Board and Assemblymember Pavley agreed to take language requiring that any new investigation order be accompanied by a written statement identifying the evidence upon which the order is based This clarification applies to all circumstances under which investigation orders are issued and should help to ensure that regional boards do not abuse this authority CALOSH STANDARDS BOARD TO CONSIDER ERGONOMIC RULE On the agenda for the July meeting in San Diego the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board Standards Board will consider a petition from organized labor to adopt the recently overturned federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA ergonomic rule as a state rule for California If adopted it would replace Californias repetitive motion standard Title CCR Employers opposed the federal rule because most employers believed it was based on dubious science that could not accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion injuries attributable to work The federal rule containe d restrictions that would prohibit doctors from providing information on nonoccupational causation of injury that would interfere with an employer s ability to determine the compensability of a claim under California workers compensation law arising out of and in the course of employment O ther onerous provisions include Requiring employers to pay work restrictions benefits that require a or replacement rate of an injured workers gross pay and the continuation of employer provided fringe benefits for up to months in the case of a musculoskeletal disorder related to work The federal rule would have carved out a completely different standard for musculoskeletal disorders injuries due to repetitive motion with remedies substantially more costly than other injuries under the workers compens ation system CMTA is requesting that members send letters to the Standards Board or atte nd the meeting to urge board members to reject the petition Write to John MacLeod Executive Officer
