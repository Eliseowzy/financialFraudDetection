any deaths or missing people among those whom we have attempted to call If you hear word of alumni friends or other members of the TLU community who have been affected by the Sept tragedy please email mailto or call so that we can send cards and spread the word to alumni and the campus Thank you Firsthand Account Douglas Rosa G works as the vice president in the Controllers Division of Deutsche Bank Manhattan branch The banks offices are located some feet from the World Trade Center in downtown NYC Rosa and his family are shaken but fine A firsthand account of Rosas experience on Sept follows Having worked some feet from the World Trade Center Tower Sept was a day unlike any other in my life I arrived at work approximately am and before entering my Deutsche Bank building at Liberty St on the south side of the WTC Tower and connected by a walking bridge I purchased a package of six apple cider donuts from the Farmers Market that just like any other Tuesday or Thursday was setting up shop outside WTC At approximately am I called my wife Dorothy home in Caldwell NJ from my office on the east side of the st floor to tell her that our building just shook and that there was a large noise as if a plane had crashed some place near by After hanging up I was told a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center I looked out my window and saw people running for their lives There were cars on fire and debris flying everywhere Our building was getting hit with pieces of the debris and it sounded like a major hailstorm We could see this remarkable amount of flame and smoke coming from the hole in Tower I screamed to my coworkers to get away from the windows At that point many of us gathered our bags and began walking down the stairs As we reached the th floor an announcement was made to stay on our floors not to evacuate Knowing that it looked pretty dangerous outside we went back to floor Then another crash came bigger than the first one Someone began screaming Run its coming down We all ran to the south side of the floor and waited for the next announcement When it was finally made they began evacuating floors We waited some more Everyone was shaking from nervousness Then they announced that everyone all floors should evacuate as soon as possible and to use the elevator if needed We began our descent quickly and orderly As we reached the second floor lobby we were told to exit the building and head south And so we did I headed blocks south to Battery Park and began looking for ways to travel back to New Jersey People told us that the ferries were still leaving from the World Financial Center directly west from the WTC so a coworker and I began walking north along the Hudson River walkway through Battery Park As we approached the ferry dock everyone around just screamed and began running for cover I ran straight for the Hudson River and never looked back I jumped over the barrier wall and stood there watching as this mushroom cloud of dust kept chasing me I decided in my own mind to jump in the water if it reached me Finally though it just stopped coming Needless to say the ferry never reached the dock Tower had fallen and most of us never even realized that it was no longer up there somewhere behind the smoke and dust Then the radio confirmed it and we also heard about the attack on the Pentagon Feverishly the police directed us further north As we continued on the sidewalk surrounded by allglass towers we were all very nervous People listened on their walkmans and desperately tried to use their cell phones to reach loved ones I stopped for an instant to lead a blind woman with a young girl to a policeman Although everyone was nervous most people kept walking in an orderly fashion without pushing We continued up the West Side Highway when suddenly the Tower gave way I turned to watch but quickly turned away and walked even faster People dropped to their knees to pray Eventually I reached another ferry terminal I waited an hour and a half in line and borrowed several cell phones to call my wife I never got through to her until I reached New Jersey though Before I got home that night I walked and ran a lot more I even found myself in the middle of a bomb scare inside the Hoboken Train Terminal I ran to Jersey City and spent the late afternoon hours with my cousin Sr Lilian Silkowski a Roman Catholic nun that lives in Jersey City I was told that two of her students siblings in the parishs high school had lost both their mom and dad Thats when it hit me how many lives had been affected The parents worked in the upper floors of the WTC Several other students have been taken out of school because their parents were employed in the WTC and have since lost their jobs and they can no longer afford the tuition When I arrived home at pm that evening I kissed my wife and my kids I thanked God for getting me home safe As I watch TV I realize how much danger I was in and thank God for looking after me The experience has reminded me of all my friends and family Although we dont always talk we are connected Among them are many of my TLU family My wife and I have been getting phone calls from all of you From Texas to Chicago to Phoenix to Connecticut to Virginia and South Carolina Thank you to Gary Angelique Kim Steve Debbie Becky Chris Mike Andrew Shirley Charlie Lana Kim Alex Kris etc You are my family Its nice to be able to say that your phone is ringing over from love and support Thank you all for your prayers and thoughts I truly believe that they made the difference for me that day For

siblings who lost both parents and the address is as follows St Marys High School WTF Fund Third St Jersey City NJ attn Sr Jacqueline Carey God bless the TLU family and God bless America Doug Rosa
