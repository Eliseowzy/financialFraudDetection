<28672731.1075852934766.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,aaron@global2000.net,2001-07-20 13:24:45,Re RTO Meeting tidbits Cc Aaron Breidenbaugh writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List As promised Here is what I have learned I spoke with Judge Young earlier today and was told that entities that are not yet intervenors in the Northeast RTO proceeding may attend the meeting next Tuesday Initially the Judge will poll parties present as to their status Those that are already intervenors in the underlying dockets need do nothing more they are considered intervenors to the RT proceeding already Those who are not already intervenors will be admitted as parties provided there are no objections If there are any objections the objecting partyies and the party seeking admittance will be given a brief opportunity to state their cases and the Judge will issue a ruling As to filing for party status with the Commission it is still not clear and the Judge did not provide guidance whether parties should file in time in docket RT or out of time in one of the underlying RTO dockets The safest bet might be to file under both In either case the mediation process may well be concluded before FERC acts on such intervention requests Thus attending the meeting and resolving party status at that time would seem to provide the quickest surest answer However Im not a lawyer and that is not legal advice Finally my understanding is that regardless of how many days the rooms are reserved for the meeting next week is for two days only Tuesday and Wednesday The substance of the mediation meetings once interventions are sorted out will be to develop a business plan milestones and timeline in short a process for developing a region wide RTO It does not appear that substantive answers to the myriad issues surrounding the move to a Northeast RTO are likely to be sought during the mediation period Hopefully this is helpful for you Aaron Aaron Breidenbaugh wrote Aaron Breidenbaugh writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List For those that are interested although no scheduling order has been issued yet by Judge Young in the Northeast RTO case a quick glance at FERCs Hearing Room reservation page publicisddayschedhtm indicates that Hearing Rooms and are reserved by Judge Young for Northeast RTO Mediations on July and Of course the fact that the rooms are reserved does not necessarily mean that meetings will be held on all of those days Nevertheless parties might be well advised to pack for more than just one overnight next week just in case Also as a number of folks have expressed interest in the same question I provide the following On behalf of the Price Responsive Load Coalition I have asked Judge Young to provide guidance on whether new parties will be admitted to the mediation and if so whether they can request party status at the meeting on the th I will share whatever guidance I receive with this list Aaron
