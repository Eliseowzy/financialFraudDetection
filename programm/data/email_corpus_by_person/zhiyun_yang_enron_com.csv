<18241623.1075858769350.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,zhiyun.yang@enron.com,2001-10-16 07:59:03,RE volatility Cc Hi Stacey Thanks for the background and insight information For weekly options if there is any we are still using the monthlydaily blending formula theres no different blending rules applied right now From your email I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio no blending should be applied this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified such as transmission deals in deal entry If this understanding is correct well need to make code changes please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting Thanks Zhiyun Original Message From White Stacey W Sent Tuesday October AM To Yang Zhiyun Chen Hai Cc Evans Casey Vinson Donald Wayne Postlethwaite John Subject RE volatility The blending vs nonblending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility therefore no blending is needed for daily options they point directly to the daily vols or monthly options they point directly to the monthly vol All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly therefore blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options The best rules to be in place for the blending vs nonblending would be based on curve East curves do not blend West curves do blend Therefore ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that for example the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region curve and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration We still need to discuss this I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules Let me know Stacey Original Message From Evans Casey Sent Tuesday October AM To White Stacey W Subject RE volatility Just wanted to make sure that you are in agreement with the fact that the items at the bottom still use blendinglet me know what you think Original Message From Chen Hai Sent Friday October PM To Yang Zhiyun Cc Lee Norman Evans Casey Mattox Michael Subject RE volatility Importance High Clarification I havent come to East Power last March Therefore the change must not be my request Clarification I like the change Clarification I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself but it is scary that people ie myself dont know the difference exits I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it Thanks Hai Original Message From Yang Zhiyun Sent Friday October PM To Chen Hai Cc Lee Norman Subject volatility Hi Hai Heres the logic about volatility Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility From last March based on your request I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios ENAWEATHER ENACCOPLANTSVCE only and for option spread and basis option only that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option The implication of that is that for other portfolios other deal types such as Asian Transmission Deal index option which East does not have right now other expiry frequency say WEEKLY which East does not have right now or deals that doesnt have expiry frequency explicitly defined the blend approach will still be applied Please let us know if you have any concerns Zhiyun
