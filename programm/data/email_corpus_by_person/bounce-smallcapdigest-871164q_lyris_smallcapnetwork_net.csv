and tired of the financi al scandals being harked by the media Companies are blaming auditors wh ile auditors are blaming Wall Street and Wall Street is blaming everybody Members of Congress are jumping on the bandwagon denouncing the companies These are the same companies that helped finance their campaigns This d rama is starting to resemble the Jerry Springer show and it is doing harm t o investors faith in the market Publicly traded companies are expected t o conduct themselves in a respectable manner This means no shredding of d ocuments and no actions of management that undermine the integrity of the c ompany Is it too much to ask for In just the past few weeks we have ha d some high profile cases IMAGEImClone Systems IMCL is being inves tigated by the SEC and the Justice Department The company is accused of m isleading investors of a highly touted colon cancer drug called Erbitux CE O Samuel Waksal told investors on a conference call that he was stunned at the FDAs decision to refuse the cancer drug application for Erbitux Ho wever a copy of the FDAs rejection letter was obtained by The Cancer Lette r It suggests Waksal and his brother Harlan knew or should have known th at the FDA had serious concerns about the way the company conducted a key c linical trial To add fuel to the fire Harlan Waksal filed a Form wit h the SEC on Dec to sell shares of ImClone stock At the time o f the filing the stock was at its week high of Call it coincidence if you will but investors feel cheated IMAGE Global Cros sing GX filed for bankruptcy this Monday Company Chairman Gary Winnick was a former Drexel Burnham Lambert sales executive that joined the junk b ond business in and left in which was five years prior to the fir ms collapse It is somewhat ironic that Global Crossings inability to pay off its debt caused the company to fall Unfortunately for GX Drexel isn t around anymore There is a winner in all this and that is the Winnick He started the company with a little over million investment and over the last three years he has managed to sell over million worth of stoc k IMAGE Tyco TYC has always had bears scrutinizing over the co mpanys accounting The Enron collapse prompted the company to announce a breakup into four units which would maximize shareholder value It seeme d like a defensive move and the market responded by selling the stock The n some troubles hit when it was revealed the company paid million to ou tside director Frank Walsh and an additional million to a charity of wh ich he is a trustee This prompted another sell off In this environment anything that even hints at impropriety will cause investors to jump ship IMAGE Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC fell as much as percent on Wednesday after the largest US independent oil and gas produ cer said it restated thirdquarter earnings to include an additional b illion in charges to reflect lower values for its US oil and gas assets The problem was that the accountants had used the wrong figures to calcula te the worth of some of the companys US energy properties Brownie poin ts go to Anadarko for correcting the error but you have to wonder if manage ment wouldve been so swift if it not for Enron It may be painful now bu t good will come out of all this Companies will face intense scrutiny when they report their earnings Stocks may be hurt in the near term but overa ll there will be a shift to a higher quality of reporting The companies listed above are predominantly large corporations and cover four different industries The problems are in no way relegated to a certain industry The bottom line is huge consulting fees are paid by big companies This i n turn creates a greater incentive for the accounting side to make sure the ir clients make their numbers It is equivalent to an investment bank havi ng their analysts issue a buy rating on a company that does banking deals with them With all the turmoil right now many investors are pulling the ir money out of the markets A poll by Investors Business Daily showed tha t out of executives polled believe there are other companies with acc ounting irregularities This is frightening but it most certainly does not mean investors should not buy stocks On the contrary there are some very exciting things happening in the world being made possible by companies th at are publicly traded The challenge is finding these companies Whereas in the past investors put their money in the stock market and expected si gnificant returns now we are in a market of stocks where it days some seri ous work to find the winners Innovation is not going to stop Can peopl e afford not to be invested in the future The SmallCap Digest has always advocated diversification This means a well balanced portfolio consistin g of companies in different sectors with varying market caps All the trou bles currently in the market have been mostly isolated to large companies Small cap companies are always in a prove it mode because they have no institutional coverage and must win over investors with their performance They face more scrutiny thus making for a less likely chance of Enroni tis In about one week we will be profiling a biotech company that has p assed our due diligence test This company is already generating very impr essive sales and looks to be profitable this year Coupled with

Investors with a to month h orizon have the potential for a plus with the next cycle of surging oil prices As oil prices drop Ray Reaves is getting ready to add assets to Fi eldPoint The SmallCap Digest has discovered a growth company in the oil and gas sector that is poised to surge FieldPoint Petroleum OTC BB FPPC has taken much of the guessing out of investing in this sector The compan y has executed and excelled in every market environment FieldPoint has sho wn a propensity to maintain profitability and grow revenues at very impress ive levels by making the right decisions The

continue expanding in Texas and Wyoming as well as in other Rocky Mountain and midcontinent states such a s Montana North Dakota and Oklahoma It is a primary objective of the Comp any to operate most of the oil and gas properties in which it has an econom ic interest Company Analysis FieldPoint is regarded in the industry as a nimble low cost provider Unlike many of its competitors FieldPoint co nsistently generates positive cash flow and has a history of acquiring pro perties far below market prices Many poorly run oil and gas companies get themselves in a position where they must raise cash to survive These distr ess sales allow FieldPoint to purchase these companies properties at price s where the production from the land pays for the purchase itself FieldPoi nt takes advantage of the competition through efficiency The companys ste llar performance in the past has created confidence and tremendous leeway w ith financiers FieldPoint has access to capital that will allow for growth while most of its competitors will experience contraction The companys track record speaks for itself Below is the revenue growth FieldPoint ha s experienced in the past three years IMAGE As depicted in the table revenues grew from to and are on track to grow this year Growth has been so prolific that the company was recently recognized by the Oil and Gas Journal as one of the Top Independent Oil

Oklahoma Management is constantly keeping an eagle s eye on potential properties that will increase FieldPoints asset base Plans For Growth IMAGEIMAGE As depicted in the bar charts growth i n both production and reserves has grown consistently since In FieldPoint had million in booked assets from which they derived in revenue and in net income The average price of oil in wa s approximately per barrel In prior to going public FieldPo ints results were slightly improved as the price of oil per barrel increas ed to an average of but their asset base held steady At the end of FieldPoint completed another acquisition that boosted assets to million and through the third quarter assets stood at million In the meantime revenues have jumped from last year and are projected a t million this year As a low cost producer FieldPoint successfully i ncreases production and lowers operational expenses every time they make an acquisition Over the course of the next months the company hopes to accumulate over million in assets Past performance would indicate t his is not an unrealistic goal That is a tenfold increase from where the c ompanys assets are today For investors the market capitalization of the company should reflect the increase in assets A million dollar asset b ase would value the company at approximately million dollars or p er share That is an annualized gain of over over a four year period Market Conditions A dispute between OPEC which produces about of th e worlds oil and nonOPEC oil producing countries have pushed prices to th eir lowest levels since mid Oil markets opened lower Thursday after t he Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided Wednesday not to c ut its output quotas unless nonOPEC producers agree to go along Russian P rime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is quoted by the Financial Times as saying We are not going to at any time reduce production on a big scale its impo ssible With oil prices taking a nosedive many poorly run and poorly f unded oil and gas companies will be feeling the squeeze Lower oil prices w ill deal a blow to the oil and gas industry resulting in less investment reduced production and ultimately more volatility as supply and demand fluc tuate This means FieldPoint will be privy to some very attractive opportun ities to purchase land at very favorable prices However oil prices may not stay depressed next year OPEC says it will cut output on Jan only if nonOPEC producers act So far Oman and Mexico have pledged output cuts of barrels a day and barrels a day respectively and Norway the worlds third largest exporter is still considering whether to contribute But all three countries say they will only reduce production i f Russia pledges to cut its output by some barrels a day Conclus ion FieldPoint is currently trading at but in the near term has the potential to reach due to the sizable opportunities the company curr ently has to expand its asset base at rock bottom prices We expect the st ock to reach this target in the next days A target of would mean a short term profit This doesnt match the companys growth rate but i t is certainly respectable and much higher on an annualized basis Grow ing companies need to reinvest in themselves The challenge is to make mone y while growing FieldPoint applies the cardinal rule of business MAKE MON EY CEO Ray Reaves has demonstrated an uncanny ability to propel growth whi le running a profitable business The goal of the company is to increase it s asset base while maintaining profitability and providing shareholders a return on their money Over the course of the next months the comp any expects to have over million in assets That is a tenfold increase from where the companys assets are today If the companys past performanc e is any indication it is an obtainable goal For for investors the marke t capitalization of the company should reflect the increase in assets A million dollar asset base would value the company at approximately mi llion dollars or per share That is an annualized gain of over ov er a four year period FieldPoint is structured to take full advantage o f volatility because the company thrives on outsmarting its competitors T he company is a growth stock that has the full confidence of its financier s This access to capital allows the company to increase its assets while benefiting

were obsolete That one penny of profit per sh are helped push the company up over for the week Could this be the be ginning of the internet renaissance Has the time come for internet compan ies to show the world that they are real companies with business models tha t can make money Well we wont go that far The past two years has been dismal for internet land Thousands of internet companies sunk faster than the Titanic Famous flameouts such as Petscom Webvan and eToys became t he butts of every dotcom joke When Jay Leno makes fun of internet compani es than you know things are really bad However at some point the laws of Darwin were bound to take over the internet sector A look at todays st ock market shows just a few dotcoms Some will inevitably burn through the remaining cash that was raised during the happy go lucky IPO period Othe rs will be acquired or just perish What people maybe missing is that ther e will be survivors that make it Some will actually thrive and develop in

Stampscom has a product co de named NetStamps that is in beta trial with the US Postal Service If this product is approved then users can print generic sheets of stamps rig ht off of their printers NetStamps should help the company boost the numb er of customers because the current Internet postage software is designed m ore for heavy users For some customers it is inconvenient to get online a

company with the cure for something The companies mentioned above are on the application side where returns are much higher although accompanied with the downside of greater risk I n addition most biotechs show little or no revenue and almost all in a se a of red ink However finding the one will lead to the kind of home run that each investor only dreams about The monetary gains are quite substan tial but so are the potential losses if something goes awry Just look at Imclone IMCL a perfect example of what happens when a dream turns to a nightmare But much like the internettechnology sector there are two types of companies First we mentioned the application companies which ar e often too risky for many investors The second type of company is on the infrastructure side usually referred to as the picks and shovels Thes e biotechs are the suppliers and drivers to the application companies Thi s relationship is similar to how Cisco CSCO and Oracle ORCL has helpe d power all the Webvans and eToys of the world Infrastructure companies often have real revenues and earnings derived from supplying application c ompanies Owning stock in infrastructure companies helps diversify much of the downside risk because there are so many startups aiming to develop tha t billion dollar cure They will spend millions on goods and services which in turn allow the infrastructure companies to build their war chest of ca sh for use in getting into the application side of the business in the futu re creating a biotech behemoth Any company can wake up one day and deci de to find a cure for any disease but trying to become an infrastructure c ompany is very difficult because of the barriers to entry Now the burnin g question is who are these picks and shovels companies The SmallCap

January IMAGE NASDAQ IMAGE For info visit wwwsmallcap networknet IMAGE S P IMAGE To be removed please click here IMAGE Russell IMAGE VOLUME ISSUE IMAGE What is a Reverse Merger Investors are familiar with the traditional IP O initial public offering as a method for going public However the curr ent market environment makes going public just about impossible This does nt mean that no new companies are coming to market Many people dont re alize there are numerous other ways for private company to become publicly traded outside of the IPO One widely used method is the Reverse Merger a simplified fast track method by which a private company can become a P ublic Company This method for going public is more prevalent than most i nvestors realize One study estimates that of all companies obtaining p ublic listings in did so through the Reverse Merger The same study concluded about of newly publicly listed companies got there through Re verse Mergers in Percentages have recently dropped because Wall Stree t Investment Banking firms have had a huge appetite for IPOs in the late s This led to many marginal companies receiving enormous financial windfal ls In todays climate we expect reverse mergers to become more prevalent w ith very few IPOs finding their way to completion Simply defined a reve rse merger occurs when a public company which has no business and usually l imited assets acquires a private company with a viable business The Privat e company Reverse Merges into the already public company which now becom es an entirely new operating entity and generally changes name to reflect t he new merged companys business The original public company commonly k nown as a Shell company has value because of its publicly traded status T he shell company is generally recapitalized and issues shares to acquire th e private company giving shareholders and management of the private compan y majority control of the newly formed public company Reverse Mergers ar e also commonly referred to as Reverse Takeovers or RTOs Benefits of G oing Public Through the RTO Reverse Take Over The RTO reverse take ove r method for going public has numerous benefits for the private company Initial costs are much lower and excessive investment banking fees are avo ided The time frame for becoming public is considerably shorter There i s no significant regulatory review or regulatory approval for the transacti on The company can now use its stock as currency to finance acquisitions and attract quality management Capital is easier to raise as investors no w have a clearly defined exit strategy Insiders can create significant we alth if they perform Negatives of Going Public Through the RTO There i s no capital raised in conjunction with going public There is limited spo nsorship for the stock There is no high powered Wall Street Investment Ba nking relationship The stock generally trades on a low exposure exchange Things You Should Know About RTOs Investors Beware Many highly succes sful companies have become public through the RTO process However there s ome important negatives investors should be aware of There is a much hig her failure rate amongst RTO companies versus the traditional IPO Much sma ller and less successful companies are able to become public through the RT O and many are badly undercapitalized Often these stocks trade very ineff iciently in the absence of any sponsorship or following There is a cotta ge industry of merchant bankers and entrepreneurs who specialize in orchest rating reverse mergers Unfortunately there are no barriers to entry in th is field Therefore scams are common place Through various methods sca m artists manage to accumulate large positions in the free trading shares o f the shell company An RTO is consummated with a marginal private company and the scam artists put together a massive publicity campaign designed to create activity in the stock Unrealistic promises and absurd claims of co rporate performance find their way to the public The enhanced trading volu me allows the scam artist to dump his shares on the unsuspecting public mo st of whom eventually lose their money once the newly formed public company fails This scam is commonly known as a Pump and Dump Alternatively t here a hundreds of examples of highly successful companies which have yield ed millions in profits for investors that have gone public through the RTO Many of these companies deserve exposure to investors Initial valuations can be reasonable providing excellent opportunities for individual investo rs to accumulate positions ahead of Wall Street institutional money Some High Profile and Successful RTOs Armand Hammer world renowned oil magna te and industrialist is generally credited with having invented the Rever se Merger In the s Hammer invested in a shell company into which he merged multi decade winner Occidental Petroleum In Ted Turner comple ted a reverse merger with Rice Broadcasting which went on to become Turner Broadcasting In Muriel Siebert renown as the first woman member o f the New York Stock Exchange took her brokerage firm public by reverse me rging with J Michaels a defunct Brooklyn Furniture company One of the D ot Com fallen Angels Rare Medium RRRR merged with a lackluster refrige ration company and changed the entire business This was a stock in which found its way over in Acclaim Entertainment AKLM merge d into non operating TeleCommunications Inc in Cross Media Marketin g XMM a stock that SmallCap Digest readers are familiar with merged in to non operating Brack Industries in Cross Media is on track to gener ate million in revenues and over million in profits in Alth ough we cant confirm this from old records Viacom is rumored to have been an RTO There are hundreds of other examples of highly successful RTOs a nd thousands of failures Individual investors can profit from knowing abou t these situations before Wall Street gets involved and places its own infl ated value on the company Investors that got into Cross Media early Novemb er are getting a taste of the benefit of getting in ahead of Wall Street mo ney managers The SmallCap Digest issued a short term trading alert on this company November th At the time the stock was trading at x next years earnings with a growth rate If Wall Street had done the IPO you would have never seen such a compelling value in the open market Institutional izing the RTO Verus International Wall Street Brokerage Firms have look ed down their nose at RTOs for years There are no massive investment banki ng fees generated in an RTO and companies hitting the public market throug h this route are generally high risk However there is a New York based Merchant Banking firm in a position to change this perception Verus Intern ational located in Midtown Manhattan has the credentials and credibility to force Wall Street to stand up and take notice Their Advisory Board re ads

Currently with ING Formally with Goldman Sachs CitiGroup has a minority ownership stake in Verus International and provi des the expertise of Wall Street legend Jack Rivkin to their management tea m While this does not insure their projects wont fail like any others in vestors can assume Verus has the opportunity to structure highly sought aft er projects due to their financial community relationships In the near f uture a Verus International client company will open for trading on the Ame rican Stock Exchange after completing an RTO We believe this stock will tr ade like a highly

GE IMAGE Dow Jones pm EST Fri October IMAGE NASDAQ For info visit wwwsmallcapnetworknet IMAGE S P To be removed please click here IMAGE Russell IMAGE Dear SmallCap Network Members Wall Street pros continue a rather heated debate over market valuations with battle results unfolding with each and every twist and turn of the pop ular averages Are pricetoearnings PE multiples on the broad market st ill too high We continue to do considerable research on this subject and have some good news and bad news to report Lets get the bad news out of the way first By historical measures current broad market value remains r elatively high The PE ratio on the SP has averaged times earnings over the past years Today the earnings multiple on the SP stands at just over times and is projected at times next years consensus e arnings forecast At the recent September lowwater mark of the PE multiple on the SP got down to times still well above the year average What most Wall Street firms are reluctant to tell is the fa ct that the average PE multiple at bearmarket bottoms over the past ye ars has been times earnings This is hardly reassuring if you consider yourself more bull than bear Thats as far as were going with the bad ne ws Suffice it to say we are reluctantly bullish so lets get to some good news First the fiveyear high PE multiple on the SP was We were unable to confirm this but believe this could represent an historic alltime high Fortunately this PE multiple was achieved at about the sa me time many fledgling and nowdefunct Internet startups were trading at times SALES not earnings IMAGE The low PE multiple on the S P was times earnings a full five years ago The broad market was in an advance that saw it double from October of to March of befo re crashing from its peak The PE on the SP was cut in half by the ti me it hit its September low While there continues to be downside risk this has to be considered pretty good news going forward The good news fo r individual investors doesnt end there Over the past years inflation has run at an average of but is holding steady at today The averag e yield on year Treasury notes during the same period is but today the yield is down to just Combine this with the fact that money marke t funds hold around trillion in cash versus an trillion total marke t capitalization and the outlook for stocks begins to brighten just a bit Whether PEs continue to contract hold steady or expand is really a fu nction of earnings performance going forward Estimates for earnings o n the SP have continued to contract as the economic slowdown drags on The challenge for the companies that make up the SP average will be t o beat those reduced estimates next year With the threat of inflation unde r control and interest rates at a year low largecap corporate America has an excellent foundation to produce some positive surprises next year The challenge for the individual investor is to find opportunities for grow th in a marketplace littered with growthstock casualties This is also why many Wall Street professionals have singled out micro and small cap value stocks to outperform the broad market over the next months Why Bec ause they are underfollowed and many of them are considerably undervalued AN UNDERVALUED MICRO CAP STOCK IN REVIEW One company weve uncovered th at represents a solid speculative micro cap value is MWave Inc NASDAQ MWAV MWAV manufactures microwave frequency components and highfrequency circuit boards using Teflonbased laminates These products are widely use d in variety of applications for wireless telecommunications and Internet s ervice products For the sixmonth period ending MWAVs revenues totaled million up from million while net income rose to mil lion from thousand With no known analyst coverage MWAV is trading at a market capitalization of about millionjust of last years m illion in revenues Even more intriguing from a valuation standpoint MWAV currently trades at times trailing month earnings and just a shade over x book value The Company announced revenues were on track to exceed last years levels and they project million in revenues in the next two to three years Some investors may shy away from companies in this gro up because they have been pummeled over the past year and a half Regardles s of its past performance of its stock price MWAVs revenue growth is proj ected to grow by over in the next two to three years MWAV shareholders have excellent upside potential from current levels In fact according to the NASDAQ three new institutional shareholders have reported adding new positions in MWAV over the past six months The fundamentals look pretty s olid going forward Lets take a look at the technical outlook The chart b elow highlights MWAV shares trading at a high as late as February When the market peaked in MWAV shares hit an alltime high of MWA V hit a closing yearly low of on September IMAGE Share s of MWAV represent a very good value for speculative investors at current levels Downside risk of about appears to be buffeted by the book value of the Company The million market cap represents just of an ticipated forward revenues of million whether it takes two to three ye ars get there We believe MWAV has an excellent opportunity to hit their r evenue goal and see their market cap expand to x revenues at some point in the next two to three years In fact if the Company were to reach a reven ue valuation of x on a trailing basis a return from todays closing price would be realized On a worstcase scenario MWAV shares appear to ho ld downside risk The SmallCap Network believes MWAV has an excelle nt chance to retest its alltime high IF they achieve the revenue results t hey have publicly stated they are targeting With million shares outst anding achieving a million market cap would produce a share pr ice at some point in the next two to three years In our view upside potential versus downside represents a riskreward scenario we are perfectly willing to live with regardless of whether the broad market i s over under or fairly valued Well look forward to presenting more of t hese types of situations in
