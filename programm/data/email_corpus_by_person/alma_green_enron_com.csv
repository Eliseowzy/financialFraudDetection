Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations We are generally used to this but this is t he last straw Being an often overlooked faction in these wars we are how ever very powerful Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r equire to survive we will sabotage these negotiations We start by asking the following questions What are your requirements for paper Have you documented these requirements What is the cost justification for ordering this paper What printers are you using Does IT have to support these p rinters That will cost extra money What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster Do you toast bread and waffles Wha t other uses do you have for the toaster Anything not specifically includ ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster To avoid further delays in the negotiations please deliver bribes in pac ks of ounce bottles of the following Dr Pepper Mountain Dew RC Cola Jolt These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning Remember paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue A toas ter without power is a metal storage box We have the power and will use i t DITPAC Command Original Message From Kuehl
