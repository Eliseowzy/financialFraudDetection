Original Message From Rodriquez Andy Sent Thursday October PM Standardizing Markets Business and Other Practices xmlnamespace prefix D o ns D urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice Panelists for this discussion were Sarah Barpoulis PGE National Energy Group William P Boswell GISB Bill Burkes substituting for David J Chr istiano City Utilities of Springfield Missouri David N Cook NERC Gene ral Counsel Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection LeRoy Koppendrayer Minnes ota Public Utilities Commission and Marty Mennes Florida Power Light Co mpany General Observations The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs

Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

Message From Walton Steve SentWednesday October PM RTO Week Day October Transmission Planning Expansion The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over

Christi L Subject RTO Week Summary of Day One Panel Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues Panel One Mandatory RTO Marketsxmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton University of MD support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet APX the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

present the majority of the time Massey left l ate in the afternoon FERC Staff was active in the discussion however the commissioners were very active as well asking perhaps as much as o f all questions There was a general consensus that standards were needed much discussion focused simply on how much and by who The Commission seem ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f orward and how far they needed to go Panelists urged the need to mover fo rward as quickly as possible but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward There was discussion on identifying which industry group NERC or GISB would take th e reins in the future On an interesting tangential note there was notice able conflict between NERC and GISB with veiled insults between the two or ganizations somewhat common during the discussions FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne eded from the Commission Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical The first major topic was How many RTOs What is their scope All panel ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b y FERC in strong definitive language N o one offered any specific langua ge but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement The next topic was What will be standard market design Panelists varie d on this but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent Some urged f or one mandatory design for North America one supported a set of rigid sta ndard designs one supported a single design with requests for exceptions followed by an indepth review process and one seemed to prefer the curre nt situation The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha t the industry needed to move forward They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions asking questions like Do we need to issue a MegaOrder that addresses all these issues and How much detail do you need us to provide General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas Kormos and Burkes went so far as t o say FERC should Mandate as much as they felt comfortable and then go a little further Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea bu t in general did not oppose the concept citing only general warnings and t he need for cautious investigation One item of interest Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th e RTO Design and RTO Implementation section would address many of the que stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design Korm os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry The se ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote and asked the following questions Congestion Management When Operational Security Violations occu r how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i s nonetheless efficient Will LMP based systems be standard or will there be others that must be accommodated Transmission Service Are transmission services required to sch edule covered schedules only or are they risk management tools protect ing from congestion charges both covered and uncovered schedules are a llowed Loop Flows Are contractpath based or flowbased transmission services appropriate If contractpath based how are parallel path issues to be addressed Grandfathered Transmission Service Should contracts existing pr ior to RTO development be transferred or is there an equitable way to reti re those contracts Are there other solutions Energy Imbalance Markets How are imbalance markets to function Will they serve as realtime energy markets support unbalanced schedules be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service require balanced sche dules or will they be required at all Ancillary Services Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services required to schedule or will they be treated primarily as fina ncial instruments protecting against realtime POLR charges Losses Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce ss or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs but technical ly unwieldy NonJurisdictionals How are nonjurisdictionals to be integrate d into the new world Should systems be designed with the assumption that nonjurisdictional will be part of an RTO Or should they be designed to t reat each NJE as a separate entity Hopefully FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica l questions in an assertive manner and give some solid direction in which to move Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions pointing out that vague answers ie do congestion management will t ake a year or two to resolve but specific answers ie LMP with financi al hedging instruments will take only months The Commission asked Mike about moving forward and he told them that effectively it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed Now for a funny point One of the commissioners I think Breathitt refer red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest Kormos flat out said My profession is understanding how power systems work and I dont believe that that statement is true He then backpedaled a bit and said t hat it would need more study but he stood by his statement that the assert ion by the Northwest interests was false NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standardse tting organization Massey went so far as to ask Are we looking at a bea uty contest between NERC and GISB Cook and Boswell then went into severa l short polite jabs at each others organizations Other participants cont inually reiterated the need for ONE INDEPENDENT organization Interesting ly Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI SB while Cook preferred to only talk about the new structure of NERC and did not focus on its history Brownell offered some nottoosubtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions ie were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder GISB was easily a ble to say they were not but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation Poin t Brownell Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC playing Dave Cooks yesm an He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERCs suppos ed successes such as TLR and ETag If staffers have tenure they will likely remember that these successes have not been so successful resulti ng in several filings and interventions We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues but general consensus was that I could not be done There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISBEISB The arguments began winding down after a some time and Boswell strongly ur ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward NERC s omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position In general I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top Let me know if you have any questions Andy Rodriquez Regulatory Affairs

Landwehr Susan M Sent Thursday October PM Thursday Morning sessionMeeting with State Commissioners This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process Although the panel notice showed that state commissioners would attend upon arriving in the hearing room we found that state commissioners were there and ready to claim their minutes of fame It was a long morning I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts Approximately to of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process that FERC was moving too quickly and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens In particular the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric While many would think that the session was extremely negative our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearingallowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis Heres some individual comments Catherine RileyMarylandshe started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens she was way overboard in the dramatics department She then stated that she was not at the meeting to help you FERC backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record It went on like this for about minutes The good part is that she was so personally negative that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her Sam ErvinNOrth Carolinahe was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens that customer choice is never coming to his state so he will never benefit from an RTO that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO and I bet if they do hell work to change the statutes and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC His comments were also pretty brutal but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor Arnetta McRaeDelwareshe kept on saying show me where the benefits for consumers are She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order Rory McMinnNew Mexicorepeatedly talked about how the west was different how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were Carl WoodCaliforniatried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments He delivered the same messages that weve been hearing foreverFERC should have acted sooner on price caps etc etc Glen ThomasPennsylvaniahe was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring its energy system into the new centurythat by opening its markets they have had an explosion in green power they have reduced costs all across the state etc He was very supportive of PJM makes sense because its in his back yard and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance Judy JonesOhiowas very parochial in her discussion but echoed Don Svandas comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed Ed GArveyMinnesotahe got the gold star for the day After very very lengthly comments from about commissioners he took about minute and said FERCjust get it donein essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward Other Commissioners who talked were ArthurConnecticut HadleyIndiana HuelsmanKentucky Nugent Maine all on the positive side Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do From the FERC commissioner standpoint the gold star went to Massey After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didnt feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back saying the there has been years of process and he wants a process that comes to an endyouve been talking for years and never could agree Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting Sue

information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge

whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s

boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of

like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation

Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not ad opt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec Day start date for LMPfinancial rights congestion model to be implemented The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the G rid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols with out any changes Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to further discussion RTOtransco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and G ridFlorida Allows for participant funded direct assigned and merchant t ransmission Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal for existin g facilities and regional charge for new facilities other than those abo ve There will be one through and out rate plus a Grid Management Char ge for RTO operation Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT Financial RightsLMP includes real time spot market is clearly the pref erred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP many details need to be worked out in continued discussions Model allows parti es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported control area operators required to provide before such market establishment RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions or at a mini mum consider similar

Nicolay Christi L Subject Re FW PGE Transmission Contract Thanks for the email In connection with this transmission agreement a business decision needs to be made as to whether EPMI can realize value from it That depends on what EPMIs long term needs for the transmission are It is very risky to assume a year deal if EPMI only needs the transmission for the next year because once EPMI assumes the contract all payment obligations under that contract are postpetition administrative claims If EPMI can find a good buyer for this contract the EPMI can assume and assign the contract and realize the value through the consideration paid by the buyer for the contract I understand that PGE may want us to assume or reject promptly but with this kind of contract we need sufficient time to allow the business plan to be fully developed and a firm understanding of what EPMIs long term needs are going to be I hope this helps Thanks Nicolay Christi L ChristiL NRONcom on AM cc Melanie GM Subject FW

Comments to NOPR The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October and Steve Walton from Enron will make a presentation on transmission planning and expansion Comments will be submitted to FERC in midNovember regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs In addition the Commission stated that RTOs would not be required to begin on the Order No start date of December however all public utilities are now required to commit by December to join a FERCapproved RTO or lose their market based rate authority Standards of Conduct NOPR Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal Comments are due late November ICAP Inquiry Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue Comments are due October California Audit and West wide Price Cap Mitigation Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and will require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Enron filed comments on October California Refund Proceeding The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Hearing will be held in midDecember Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest We expect a Commission order shortly MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings by the end of October Northeast RTO Proceeding Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission Enron filed comments advocating a NE RTO based on the PJM congestion management system with a proposed start date of December PJM has proposed an implementation date of November Commission action is expected on or before October Southeast RTO Proceeding Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission advocating an independent transco structure for the RTO and an LMPfinancial transmission rights congestion model Enron filed comments in support and advocating a December start date Commission action is expected on or before October West wide RTO Proceedings The Commission stated that it wants the proposed Desert Star RTO and RTO West to marry up into one RTO It appears that the Commission will treat California separately The Desert Star RTO has collapsed and the transmission owners are now proposing a transco structure Commission action is expected later this year Interconnection proceeding The Commission is expected to address interconnection issues with standardized procedures and agreements likely at its meeting on October Enron has strongly advocated standardized procedures and will participate in the proceeding Market Based Rate Authorization The Commission is expected to address procedures for qualifying to sell power at market based rates which may include an assessment of localized generation in a particular region supply margin assessment The Commission is also considering adding tariff language that could make market based rates subject to refund upon date of a complaint or finding by FERC of market abuse

procedure Importance High EES and EPMI services folk We would like your comments on this imbalance proposal by Portland General FYIto the extent that FERC accepts Portlands proposal it could be used as precedent for other utilities PGE proposed a price to clear imbalances that was rejected by the FERC FERC told PGE to look to the Exelon order for guidance After an extension the compliance filing is due Monday They have sought your reactioncomments They had a discussion with FERC staff on how to comply Staff agreed that under the Order PGE could use the average spot price excluding long term purchases of purchases and sales in the hour before to clear imbalances Schedule The PGE situation does not fit the Exelon model because PGE does not have purchases and sales in every hour apparently Exelon did FERC staff agreed the situation was different but had no suggested solutions Staff requested that PGE propose something and the FERC would react The something is A variant of the proposal recently approved for Pacific Corp PGE would use Mid C prices but use PGEs actual daily load shape Apparently Pacific Corp proposed Mid C prices but would use the load shape from California This load shape is quite different then PGEs and could lead to arbitrage opportunities against PGE by thirdparties Right now PGEs traders and outside counsel disagree on the best approach The traders want to just proposeuse the Mid C price proposal for all hours Outside counsel believes they should proposeuse the average spot price proposal when PGE does make purchases andor sales in the hour before and

this too Also let me know if you think we need outside assistance with this THANK S Original Message From Portz David SentWednesday November PM ToNicolay Christi L CcGilbertsmith Doug Baughman Edward D Miller Jeffrey Forney Jo hn M SubjectErcot Questions OOMC OOME Forwarded as discussed Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant and sidesteps the obligation to pa y an OOME price component when the plants output is utilized by ERCOT Th e OOMC compensation is currently negligible and recovery of actual costs u nder Protocols Sec may take a long time and the OOME compensa tion has various problems as well the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME the the lesser the OOME price paid Protocols Sec Heat Ra te value decreases and plants directed to provide say MWs of OOM COOME are not allowed to generate above MWs in an interval thus runn ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate to sell the excess in the marketplace The Frontera plant a customer of EPMI acting as QSE is locat ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS E to provide OOMC to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh ould be Reliability Must Run RMR and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system reliability I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols conducted under Protocols Section and we would appreciate any reg group efforts toward preparation for iinit iating such dispute Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom orrow even if ERCOT tells us their QSE that it should be dispatched Thus we are caught in the middle The legitimate bases for not complying with a n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section thr eat to safety risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr oducts that it is generating capacity available but not energy delivered t o the grid I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC The Operating Gui des definition of OOMC page seems to recognize this however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks

comfortable supporting me please send an email to Donna Dare by pm Monday stating that Enron supports the nomination of Mike Roan regards Mike Please let me know the outcome Forwarded by Michael J RoanAEPIN on PM Taylor David W PM To cc Subject MISO Advisory Committee Power Marketing Representatives The MISO has requested that each of the sectors identify their Advisory Committee representatives for the term Specifically I am coordinating the selection of the Power Marketing sector representatives For the past year Enron and Constellation have represented the Power Marketing sector on the MISO Advisory Committee With the addition of MAPP to the MISO a third Power Marketing seat has been added to the Advisory Committee Constellations seat is set to expire at the end of the year and the new MAPP seat needs to be filled leaving two seats to fill for the term the new seat along with Constellations However at this point in time and considering Enrons current situation those Power Marketing entities that have been regularly attending the Advisory Committee meetings have proposed to also replace the Enron representative under the belief that Enron cannot properly represent the sector at this time This results in the filling of all three Power Marketing seats at this time The following entities have expressed an interest in being a Power Marketing representative on the MISO Advisory Committee and are hereby the nominees for the Power Marketing sector Constellation Harvey ReedDave Taylor Mirant Jim Mayhew AEP Mike Roan Detroit Edison Ron Bauer We will hold a secret ballot vote in order to determine the Power Marketing representatives on the MISO Advisory Committee Donna Dare of the MISO has graciously volunteered her time to receive and tabulate the ballots for our sector as an independent entity The manner in which we will vote will be that each power marketing company will rank the nominees in order of preference and then email the rankings to Donna Dare at the MISO ONLY ONE VOTE PER COMPANY Donna will apply points to the rankings she receives points for the first preference points to the second preference points for the third preference and point for the forth preference The two nominees receiving the most points will be assigned a two year term on the MISO Advisory Committee while the nominee with the third highest point total will receive a one year term on the MISO Advisory Committee Donna will let the sector know whom the selected representatives are and their associated terms but will not release which companies voted for which nominees

Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not ad opt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec Day start date for LMPfinancial rights congestion model to be implemented The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the G rid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols with out any changes Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to further discussion RTOtransco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and G ridFlorida Allows for participant

clearly the pref erred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP many details need to be worked out in continued discussions Model allows parti es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported control area operators required to provide before such market establishment RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO

Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not ad opt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec Day start date for LMPfinancial rights congestion model to be implemented The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the G rid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols with out any changes Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to further discussion RTOtransco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and G ridFlorida Allows for participant funded direct assigned and merchant t ransmission Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal for existin g facilities and regional charge for new facilities other than those abo ve There will be one through and out rate plus a Grid Management Char ge for RTO operation Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT Financial RightsLMP includes real time spot market is clearly the pref erred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP many details need to be worked out in continued discussions Model allows parti es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported control area operators required to provide before such market establishment RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions or at a mini mum consider similar
