yourself at IndexSkyboxcom is ADVERTISEMENT Twelve Safer Equity Fund Bets By Steve Wagner The objective of this monthly screen is to identify what were calling safer bets for different equity investment objectives By safer we dont mean that they cant lose money in any short term period Equity mutual funds in general have greater risk are more volatile than bond funds and money market funds but have greater longterm return potential What were providing here are the more conservative best bets within each objective those that have produced competitive results with minimal risk and volatility relative to other funds with the same objective These funds are geared to the average mutual investor who wants to participate in the equity market and is willing to give up a little upside potential to sleep better at night Each of them has Value Lines highest overall score of as well as a risk score of or better low risk Each fund also sports a low expense ratio in relation to their equity objective peers and a low initial fund investment of or less Since return and risk should be considered in light of a funds investment objective we break down our safe fund bets in four different equity objectives growth growth and income income and balanced Each objective is equityoriented but varies in terms of their emphasis on growth or income Mutual investors interested in any one of these funds should do their own due diligence to ensure that the fund meets their investment goal and comfort with risk No one mutual fund fits all investors Growth Objective Growth funds seek to provide longterm capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks Current income if considered at all is a secondary concern Three low risk best bets with growth objectives are as follows Fidelity Dividend Growth FDGFX Gabelli Asset GABAX Tweedy Browne American Value TWEBX Tweedy Browne American Value Year Avg SP buys common stocks with very low price multiples and since its inception has consistently maintained a midcap value bias Due to the low price risk of its holdings the funds risk score is as excellent as its returns says Morningstar They also say that its returns look especially good after taxes Gabelli Asset Year Avg SP also likes the midcap sector and over the past five years has moved between value and blend styles Its value approach and diversification across industries and issuers helps limit risk per Morningstar Its topnotch returns are the result of great stock picking and willingness to play bold themes according to Morningstar Fidelity Dividend Growth Year Avg SP also blends value and growth stocks but prefers to fish in largecap waters where the fund can fulfill its mandate of holding growth companies which exhibit potential for dividend growth Its low risk profile results from its avoidance of volatile tech stocks in addition to tight risk controls Strong research and equity selection Fidelity trademarks contribute to an excellent long term performance record Growth Income Objective Growth and income funds seek longterm growth of capital plus income from dividends They typically select equities for both their appreciation potential and dividendpaying ability Three low risk best bets with growth and income objectives are listed below Dodge Cox Stock DODGX Jensen Fund JENSX T Rowe Price Capital Appreciation PRWCX T Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Year Avg SP specializes in finding opportunities among securities that the market has overly punished for various reasons It invests in common stocks believed to be undervalued by various measures such as pricebook and establishes relatively large positions in those companies it finds particularly attractive The fund also invests in fixed income securities and convertibles to give it a riskadverse profile Dodge Cox Stock Year Avg SP also has a value approach but invests primarily in the largecap sector Through the years it has consistently maintained a largecap value bias Like the other value funds profiled the lower price risk of its holdings contributes to its low relative risk score Morningstar says managements eye for fundamentally strong companies trading at cheap prices has produced results that are tough to argue with and youll get no argument from me Jensen Fund Year SP invests primarily in growth companies with long histories of delivering high returns on equity are in excellent financial condition and have raised dividends in recent years Since its inception the fund has consistently maintained a largecap growth style bias The fund invests in growth stocks at a reasonable price and because of managements focus on valuation and quality fund volatility has been kept low Income Objective Income funds commonly known as equityincome funds seek income from the dividends and interest generated by the funds holdings Growth of capital is a secondary objective Three low risk funds with income objectives are as follows American Century Equity Income TWEIX Parnassus Equity Income PRBLX Van Kampen Equity Income A ACEIX American Century Equity Income Year Avg SP is similar to T Rowe Price Capital Appreciation in that it buys stock of companies that are beaten down but focuses on companies that can quickly rebound Though the years it has maintained a midcap value bias Because it is less patient than other value funds portfolio turnover is higherthanaverage making it more suited to IRA and other taxdeferred accounts Parnassus Equity Income Year Avg SP and Van Kampen Equity Income A Year Avg SP are both largecap value oriented in management style Management directs its attention toward the issues of wellestablished undervalued companies that offer potential income consistent with safety of principal Both income funds invest the majority of assets in incomeproducing equities with a portion invested in bonds and convertibles to derive a riskadverse portfolio Balanced Objective Balanced funds seek both income and capital appreciation by investing in a fairly static mix of stocks and bonds with at least of portfolio assets in bond securities at all times Three low risk funds with balanced objectives are as follows Dodge Cox Balanced DODBX Oakmark Equity Income OAKBX Thompson Plumb Balanced THPBX Oakmark Equity Income Year Avg SP buys cheap midcap stocks of cashrich companies for its equity stake and government bonds and highyield corporate securities for its fixed income allocation Due to the low price risk of its stock holdings and quirky asset mix the funds risk score is very low relative to other domestic hybrids while generating high return for shareholders Dodge Cox Balanced Year Avg SP uses the same largecap value approach followed by Dodge Cox Stock for the equity allocation and invests in investmentgrade securities for the fixed income stake This traditional balanced fund is one of the oldest funds in America with roots dating back to the year Morningstar calls it a category standout generating strong longterm results for loyal shareholders Thompson Plumb Balanced Year Avg SP uses a combination of value and growth methods to construct a broadly diversified portfolio of companies with strong franchises high returns on equity solid longterm prospects and low valuations On the fixedincome side the fund does not make large interest rate bets but invests in highquality intermediateterm bonds Because it tends to allocate assets more in equities than other balanced offerings it is most suitable for investors primarily favoring solid capital appreciation over income Summary Through the years Ive been asked to recommend good mutual funds These dozen funds have kept risk low by having tight risk controls and focusing on identifying value opportunities through strong fundamental research Each of them have beaten the stock market measured by the SP index over the past five years while minimizing risk relative to other funds with the same objective Accordingly they are all good funds in our opinion and safer ways to play the equity market Most of them are offered on a noload basis and come with low expenses adding to their overall appeal MutualInvestorcom Section WHO IS MUTUALINVESTORCOM For most of us whether we traded our own account or whether we put our money in mutual funds last year has not been the best for our

Monthly February Edition Stock Investing Section Copyright All rights reserved Redistribution in any form is strictly prohibited The entire newsletter is best viewed in COURIER for alignment In this Stock Investing edition PremierInvestorcom Presents NonTech Monthly Pick by Stock Bottom Mans Best Friend The combination of strong sales growth rising margins and an investing public that wants to see results today will keep this train chugging higher Tech Stock of the Month by NetBulls Another Entry Point for Bulls This is one software stock that we dont mind making a play for despite a lack of leadership in the group Next Week Next week look for our Option Trading Picks for the month of February NonTech Monthly Pick for Active Investors PETsMART Inc PETM close change stop Company Description PETsMART Inc is the largest specialty retailer of services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets The Phoenix AZbased company operates more than pet stores in the United States and Canada as well as a large pet supply catalog business and is the major controlling investor in the Internets leading online provider of pet products and information wwwpetsmartcom PETsMART provides a broad range of competitively priced pet food and supplies and offers complete pet training grooming and adoption services source company press release Why We Like It One glance at the chart of PETM and it is easy to see why investors might be drawn to the stock Fortunately it would appear that PETM actually has some earnings to back up this amazing rise in its stock price For many investors was not a fun year in the stock market Yet for PETM shareholders they saw a share price near its March lows rise to the level by the end of December Management seems to have good control over some of the challenges of running a store chain while still keeping growth as part of the equation PETsMARTs latest earnings report which was for its Q came out back in November but inside there was plenty of information that investors liked to hear Weve grabbed a quote from their Q earnings press release Improvements in key areas such as in stocks inventory management and distribution efficiency coupled with the continued growth in our pet services business drove sales and profitability during the third quarter said Phil Francis chairman president and chief executive officer of PETsMART Inc Weve gained a good deal of momentum and are positioned for a solid fourth quarter and a strong when well bring our new store format to existing stores open to new stores and continue to drive a companywide culture of customer care Phil has reason to be positive if the companys numbers keep up their current pace The same Q report showed that gross margins had risen to percent up basis points compared with the third quarter the year before Total sales for the quarter had jumped to million while comparable store sales added percent over the Q of The company recently announced that they had bought the remaining percent interest in PETsMARTcom that they didnt own for million In addition to the purchase they would consolidate the dotcom business and their PETsMART Direct an equine direct marketing business into their overall operations Part of this plan would close certain offices in California and move the operations to their Phoenix AZ headquarters This announcement came out after the bell on Tuesday January nd and investors were unsure how to interpret the news which caused some volatility in the stock price the next day Since then weve seen some selling in the stock but we feel the pull back towards the level has merely offered us a better entry point On a positive note the same announcement revealed that the company had raised their sales growth outlook for the January quarter from to percent to about percent We could not confirm an actual date but believe PETM will announce its Q earnings in late February How do we trade the stock from here It would be easy to say that on a longerterm basis the stock could be considered overbought However in this current market environment where investors are asking show me the earnings PETM should continue to draw investor interest There arent many companies right now with strong sales growth and growing profit margins Technically buyers have been supporting the stock price every time it dips to the dma during the last three months from Nov st Shares dipped below this level midweek but quickly rebounded At the moment the dma is near the mark which can also double as a strong psychological support level Were going to start the play with a stop loss at which is a few cents below the dma but were only giving the stock this extra room because we have a two to three month time frame More conservative traders or shortterm traders could easily use a tighter stop loss One suggestion would be to place a stop under Wednesdays low of PETM does have some overhead resistance at the level but the overall bullish trend should be able to conquer it Our objective is a price target This is almost above current levels We suspect that Americas new tendency to stay home and spend money on the house and the family will also translate into more money on the family pet Picked on January th at Gain since picked Earnings Date Feb not confirmed Chart chartschartsaspsymbolPETM Tech Stock of the Month for Tech Bulls Cognos Inc COGN close change stop Company Description Cognos is the leading global provider of business intelligence solutions that optimize the performance of the worlds largest and most successful organizations Founded in Cognos does business with more than customers in countries around the world Cognos business intelligence solutions and services are also available from more than worldwide partners and resellers source company press release Why We Like It The software sector has been a jumpy group lately and were not seeing a lot of leadership with MSFT trading below its dma However we have noticed a few players in the business solutions group doing okay One of those is Cognos Inc Shares of the stock have done very well the last few months and really jumped higher in December after their Q earnings report The stock ran into heavy resistance at the level in early January but has since consolidated back to the mark with a nice intraday dip last Wednesday Volume was pretty strong on Friday as bulls pushed shares up almost heading into the weekend In the news First Albany Corp recently upgraded COGN to a buy and gave it a price target First Albany cited the recent earnings improvement over the last two quarters and a decent entry point supporting a decent riskreward scenario in COGN We happen to agree with them on the entry point idea and dont mind targeting the level either There is still a wall at but hopefully this time COGN will be able to trade through it We are going to start the play with a stop at which is Wednesdays low We still recommend keeping an eye on MSFT and the GSOX software index to gauge the market atmosphere Picked on January th at Change since picked Earnings Date unconfirmed Chart chartschartsaspsymbolCOGN ABOUT PremierInvestorcom WHO IS
