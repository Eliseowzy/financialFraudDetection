<32104604.1075855785812.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tom.hopwood@gte.net,2000-08-11 09:00:00,ReplyI will give some deep thought over the weekend in the meantime here are some current thoughts regarding Brents trip First I am hopeful that a letter will go out regarding Brent before his trip and that it clearly states that Brent will continue to report directly to you that sends a powerful message locally and globally Is that going to occur Assuming the above takes place what is the messaage you Sally want Brent to convey on your behalf at each and every meeting he attends with his and your people Thirdly I would suggest that Brent and Scott not try to hit a homerun on this first trip You as well as Brent and Scott do not need to win the respect of Shankman so I strongly urge consistency maturity and incredible listening skills in fully understanding the DEPTH and exact nature of the problems arising so solutions arise from the strength of the data surrounding the core issues I would prepare Brent with any language you would want him to appropriately respond to possible questions from Sheriff Dyson Jordan or anyone else for that matter who might want to probe into whether all of operations is going to roll up under you Until you have your meeting with Frevert I would offer that any questions that may come Brents or Scotts way simply be diplomatically deferred Have them make simple I statements All I know is that my role here is to I cant speak to what might be happening with other product lines I will read closely your notes please have mary solmonson give you a copy of Freverts talk at the global systems gathering and see if there are a couple of connection points for you to gateway your vision for global consistency to align with his My Sally vision for this looks like this Why it makes sense to do this now Whats at risk if we dont do this now Paint a relistic yet challenging picture in hopes that he asks Are you Sally up to the challenge Others support this as well Does he care if so who else I want to move forward effective Do I have your support If you have some time on Monday let Patti know and I will give you a call Assuming that a letter goes out on Brent will you put a letter out on ENA Risk Settlementges Logistics other staff changes such as Scribner Sheila Hall etc If you do not have the time to write it up let me know and I can support you with a draft for your modification however I would want to talk specifics Monday I am very excited for you and the organization and remain hopeful that this is yet another growth experience preparing you for an even greater role Regrds Tom Original Message From Sally Beck To Sent August PM GMT Subject Meeting with Mark Frevert Should We Move It Up FYI Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him By voice mail I suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting We are set for next Thursday August at in Rick Causeys office over lunch I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that I have his support Rick Causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert Any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine Sally Forwarded by Sally BeckHOUECT on PM Embedded Enron North America Corp image moved to file From Sally Beck picpcx PM To Richard NRON cc Subject Meeting with Mark Frevert Should We Move It Up Not surprisingly the organization is moving faster than Rick Buys vacation schedule Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert Rick Buy you and me on August two weeks from next Monday dictated by Rick Buys schedule I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team which will include a discussion on Brents role and reporting responsibilities Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around coordination between EEL and EGM In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated Separately Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the OperationsCAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August Thats a lifetime to a trader and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week I have checked Marks travel schedule He will be in the Houston office next week with Thursday August as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting I am not trying to rush this process yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA EGM and EEL operations I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions rather than arrive at the party late
