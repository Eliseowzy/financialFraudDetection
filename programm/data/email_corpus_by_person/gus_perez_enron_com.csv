Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers Published May Gov Gray Davis on Thursday declared President Bushs newly unveiled power plan an inadequate proposal that turns a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state The Democratic governor who addressed reporters in Sacramento after Bush formally unveiled his proposal in St Paul Minn said California will not conquer its power crisis unless the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission temporarily caps the price of wholesale electricity The Bush plan which calls for opening more public lands to oil and gas exploration and tax credits for the purchase of fuelefficient cars woul d do little for the state in the short term when it needs help the most Dav is said For those of us who are already in immediate peril it offers no relief he said If those federal commissioners dont do anything to solve the problem then there will be a lot of blood on the floor and a lot of corpses along the way In Washington DC GOP congressional leaders vowed to speed key parts of the energy package to Bushs desk But the strong and conflicting response to the page report crafted over four months by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney presaged an extensive debate on Capitol Hill Were going to have a crisis on our hands in the next two or three months said Rep Robert Matsui a Sacramento Democrat I just wish the president had attempted to address that If he doesnt like our idea of rate caps and price stability then at least he should come up with an alternative to try to get us through the next months But Republicans like North Carolina Rep Richard Burr vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee were quick to praise the package This is the most aggressive longterm energy policy our country has seen from an administration in a generation Burr said As in Washington California lawmakers split down party lines in response t o the presidents energy plan Democrats said the proposal would do little to help California in the short term while Republicans applauded its focus on increasing the power supply through expanded reliance on nuclear energy and other sources While environmentalists found several aspects of the blueprint troubling utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric Co and power generating companies said they were encouraged by the presidents call to speed the process of building new power plants transmission lines and natural gas pipelines It appears at first glance to be a very balanced document with combination s of conservation as well as the need to create new sources of energy said Keith Bailey chairman of Williams Co which markets electricity from Southern California power plants owned by AES PGE however which is mired in bankruptcy proceedings because of runaway wholesale power prices repeated its call for federally imposed price caps on wholesale electricity something Bush has specifically rejected On that one point at least the utility has found allies in Davis and othe r California Democrats Im calling on you Bush to find some creative way to give us temporary price relief while our new plants come on line Davis said State Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey and chairwoman of the Senate Energ y Committee echoed the governors plea We cant just focus on the long term here she said The patient will be dead before we get the lifesupport systems in place Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones who is running for governor also commended the president for proposing a comprehensive plan with longterm vision What President Bush understands that Gray Davis does not is that the time to propose solutions is not in the middle of a crisis but before when you see the warning signs and have time to plan a thoughtful course of action he said In one of more than specific proposals Bush urged the FERC to strength en its role in electric grid reliability partly through new laws that would l et it oversee mandatory industry standards Such a move could strip away some of the benefits of Davis proposal to buy the states transmission grid because it could extend federal control to transmission lines owned by public agencies said Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network It could also threaten the autonomy of municipal utilities such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Los Angeles Department of Wat er and Power and would face a vigorous fight in Congress Shames said Other specifics of the plan such as its recommendation to reassess offshor e oil drilling troubled environmental groups The president is probably too realistic to move immediately to reinstate drilling off Californias coast but opponents will have to stay vigilant t o prevent it said Warner Chabot a vice president of the Center for Marine Conservation The plan was also blasted by the California Public Interest Research Group for overreliance on new power plants drilling on public lands and increas ed subsidies for coal and nuclear power while the Sierra Club faulted the lac k of proposals to raise fuel economy standards for cars and sportutility vehicles Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said such standards are the biggest single step President Bush could have taken to cut our oil dependence and curb global warming The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or James Rosen of The Bees Washington Bureau contributed to this report Judge dims PGE producers shot at relief By Claire Cooper Bee Legal Affairs Writer Published May SAN FRANCISCO US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali delivered a sharp blo w to a large number of small energy generators signaling in an opinion released Thursday that hell probably require them to continue selling powe r within California and at stateregulated rates The tentative ruling in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co bankruptcy case denied most of the relief requested by the first four generators to have their cases decided The Central Valley powergenerating plants have warned that financial pressures may force them to shut down in June cutting into the power needed to avoid rolling blackouts this summer They asked to be released from their contracts with PGE or for higher pric es for the power they sell to the utility Montali responded by sweeping beyond the technical confines of bankruptcy law saying The court cannot and will not ignore other considerations such as the need to keep the generators online producing power for California While the four facilities provide less than percent of the utilitys electricity the tentative opinion sent out a broad message to scores of small power producers which together provide more than percent of PGEs electricity that Montali will give them just enough relief to kee p them generating Montali however said he isnt likely to release them from contracts to PG E that stand in the way of selling their electricity on the spot market possibly to the state Department of Water Resources at potentially extreme prices Montalis decision posted Thursday was dated Wednesday the same day the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order ensuring energy producers the right to sell to the highest bidder if they can get out of their contractual obligations Montali also declined to raise the price PGE must pay under current contracts While conceding the energy producers are entitled to a reasonabl e rate he cited FERC findings that under certain conditions spot market rat es in the California market have been unjust and unreasonable Instead Montali held out the likelihood of far more modest relief He ordered immediate negotiations to increase the cash flow sufficiently at th e four Central Valley power facilities Midset Cogeneration Coalinga Cogeneration Salinas River Cogeneration and Sargent Canyon Cogeneration with the goal of ensuring they will be able to perform when needed The four generators had warned in court documents of June shutdown scenario which would have cut into the power needed to avoid rolling blackouts this summer They are owed million out of a total billion PGE debt to producers of wind and solar energy cogeneration and biomass that provide roughly percent to percent of the electricity distributed by the utility Most including a plant that generates energy from rice hulls are small or midsized but several are owned by some of the nations largest corporations including Texaco Theyre paid on the basis of various formul as set by contracts or a formula set by the Public Utilities Commission Ed Feo a lawyer representing the creditors committee which will be included in the negotiations said Montalis tentative ruling will probabl y be the template for the way he deals with all of the small producers operating at PUCapproved rates that dont cover their costs The committee represents thousands of businesses and individuals who are ow ed money by PGE It had asked in a hearing a week ago that all of the small generator cases be consolidated for a single ruling because of the likely impact Montali refused saying the complications would be more than I can comprehend because each case presents different facts About two dozen facilities have petitioned Montali for relief so far including that have curtailed or ceased operations at times this spring claiming PGEs payments were insufficient to keep them online Several have hearings scheduled within the next three weeks but at least t wo Berry Petroleum and Crockett Cogeneration have reached settlement agreements with the utility In response to Montalis tentative ruling on the four Central Valley generators PGE spokesman Ron Low said only that the utility will meet wi th them and try to resolve the issues Lawyers representing the generators did not return phone calls Politicians try to stay plugged in Fear that the power crisis will shortcircuit their jobs pushes leaders to foster an active image By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published May Rising unemployment is one of the many dire predictions spawned by the states worsening energy crisis Among those worried about losing their jobs California politicians Fearing for their hides state leaders are moving forcefully into the energ y fray hoping both to fend off irritated voters and emerge from their typically lowprofile posts Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante recently filed suit against five energy generators Attorney General Bill Lockyer offered rewards of at least million to informants who could help prove market manipulation by power sellers And state Treasurer Phil Angelides has aggressively pushed for a staterun powe r authority Were seeing among a range of officeholders on the Democratic and Republic an side that they want to be seen as being out front of this issue said Mark Baldassare a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California As they go through this reelection year coming up they dont want to be accused by people who are competing for office of not doing anything Since January legislators have introduced at least energyrelated bill s including a proposal to finance the construction of an Auburn dam and anoth er to exempt farmers from paying sales and use taxes on diesel fuel during the last half of this year Whenever possible Gov Gray Davis schedules news conferences at power plants which provide optimal backgrounds for photo opportunities Power plants also are the focus of the states latest television and radio ads encouraging energy conservation which boast that California is workin g aggressively to build major new plants Although Davis chief political adviser Garry South says its a coincidence the Democratic governors political consultants recently teste d a spot that also touts the states record on power generation The energy crisis has led lowerprofile politicians to increase their visibility Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones who is running for governor and Democratic state Controller Kathleen Connell who ran for Los Angeles mayor have both used the crisis to criticize Davis leadership As lieutenant governor Bustamante generally remains out of the public eye and struggling for attention But the Democrat sponsored a bill that would make energy price gouging a felony and filed a civil lawsuit against five outofstate generators alleging a pricefixing conspiracy Bustamante said he is merely stepping up to calls from constituents who are clamoring for him to act Political consultant Richie Ross who works for Bustamante and other Democrats is convinced the energy crisis will have political consequences and could ultimately ruin careers He believes those lawmakers who take action to defend the public will hav e a better chance of political survival than those who dont The public is looking for who is on their side he said Theyre not interested in all the complexity Republican political consultant Wayne Johnson recommends that all politicia ns who want to be reelected engage themselves and get to know the power issue backward and forward Consultants say pollsters are busier than usual as politicians rush to determine their standing and that of their opponents with voters So far those who have seen the results say Republicans and Democrats are taking an equal beating Every politician in the states popularity rating is lower than it once was said Davis pollster Paul Maslin Though lawmakers like to say they inherited the crisis from the previous administration and Legislature that explanation doesnt resonate with Californians who are more interested in solutions Many voters are saying they dont care who was in power at the time deregulation was conceived and they dont care who is in power now South said They just want it to be over This is not a partisan thing Its a pox on everybodys house said David Townsend a Democratic political consultant People are basically saying Fix it The publics level of frustration is expected to escalate in the coming months when the effects of the power crisis multiply Baldassare is in the midst of surveying Californians on the energy crisis a nd has dropped in on a number of focus groups Many participants reported that theyre generally unhappy with the situation but still arent sure whom to blame According to Sherry Bebitch Jeffe a political scientist at the University of Southern California politicians are doing what they can to make sure its not them Each legislator out there is trying to insulate himself or herself from th e worst blame for the energy crisis she said Theyre attempting to inoculate themselves from inevitable attacks from opponents The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Bushs mixed message Fossil fuels tomorrow dont solve crisis now Published May President Bush seeks to focus public attention on tomorrows energy challen ge while doing little to prevent a looming electricity crisis that may start i n California this summer and spread to other parts of the country The existing crisis is so serious and so neglected by the president it wi ll be hard for Californians to focus on his glossy new energy blueprint which he unveiled Thursday with campaignstyle fanfare Documents such as these this one has more than specific recommendations when successful end up serving the broader purpose of launching public discussion and political debate This time though the president has no choice but to enter this debate in the present not the future California waits wonders and bleeds as billio ns of dollars in excess electricity profits go to generating companies and traders Whats so perplexing about this president is the emerging philosophical inconsistency between how he sees the energy future and the present Line b y line recommendation by recommendation Bushs longterm energy strategy proposes to fully insert the government as a guiding hand of tomorrows energy marketplace Rather than leave the market to itself Bush seeks to shape it via direct subsidies tax incentives or new fossilfuel opportunities on public lands Yet today for California the president sticks to a handsoff approach rejecting intervention in a horribly distorted electricity marketplace Why Viewed as an alacarte menu Bushs energy strategy offers something for everyone Appetizers range from tax breaks to fuelconscious motorists who want to buy hybrid cars to billions of dollars in new research to burn coal more cleanly The main course however is more fossil fuels and more nucle ar power plants And some cuttingedge stuff such as new funds for alternativ e fuels research are tied to one controversial source royalties from new gas and oil development in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge The charts and graphs all speak to matching future supply with demand as i f the challenge is two dimensional It is not The third piece barely mentioned by Bush is global warming Energy policy must address not avoid the compelling evidence that our fossilfuel consumption is dangerously warming the planet Bushs plan doesnt mandate improvements in any vehicle s fuel efficiency by a single mile per gallon Viewed by other countries that take global warming more seriously Bushs energy plan will be the equivale nt of political gasoline We need to have a serious discussion about the nations longterm energy future Bushs plan whatever its shortcomings started the debate But eve n more than talk California and the West need federal action to curb runaway wholesale electricity prices this summer Bush yesterday failed to step up to the challenge Bush energy plan greeted with avalanche of praise criticism By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON Battle lines hardened Thursday over President Bushs energy policy leaving little apparent room for compromise House Democrats began the day with a hightech assault on the plan that featured three San Diegoarea residents pleading via satellite for immediat e relief from soaring utility bills and blackouts An environmental group staged a more lowtech stunt dumping five tons of coal in front of Vice President Dick Cheneys residence Republicans meanwhile embraced the plan But some cautioned that its legislative elements were likely to be tinkered with and that some relief f or consumers may have to come quicker than Bush envisions Much of the Democratic criticism centered on Bushs failure to offer immediate help for the power crisis rocking California and the high gas prices plaguing motorists They also repeated their accusation that by stressing more use of oil coal and nuclear power Bush was sacrificing the environment for the sake of energy industry profits To dramatize those arguments Reps Susan Davis and Bob Filner both San Diego Democrats used a satellite broadcast to beam three constituents into a packed news conference on Capitol Hill The lawmakers have been pressing fo r price controls on wholesale power sold in California a strategy Bush has rejected We need help now said Patti Finnegan who runs Niederfranks Ice Cream i n National City I understand that we need more supply but in the meantime I dont think thieves should be out legally taking our money like this Finnegan said the business power bills had quadrupled and that rolling blackouts have the potential to put me out of business by melting her inventory Michael Brucker executive director of San Diegos Jackie Robinson YMCA an d San Diego resident Jaime Salazar told similar tales of soaring power bills and sacrifice Its a really great plan if youre a seller of energy But if youre a consumer of energy this is not a good energy plan said Davis It was crafted behind closed doors with a lot of input from energy executives and in a highly secretive way that doesnt serve the public interest added House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMo It real ly looks like the ExxonMobil annual report and maybe thats really what it is Republicans countered that the proposal was balanced They cited Bushs cal l for tax credits for energy conservation and efficiency and his promise to take environmental impacts into account as domestic oil drilling is expande d Rep Randy Duke Cunnigham REscondido called the blueprint comprehensi ve and mindful of the environment While Bush didnt talk about it in the plan the administration has taken several steps to aid to California Cunningham said including expediting permits for new power plants Weve got to throw out the extremists on both side of this and solve the problem he said Republican leaders said they would start hearings on the plan as early as next week and hope to have a bill finished by midsummer Fearing a voter backlash if they appear to be ignoring consumer complaints about high energy costs some GOP lawmakers are advocating shortterm measures like immediate tax incentives for home energy conservation and suspension of the federal gasoline tax Congress will be working with the president to enhance his plan I wil l be offering some amendments said Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison RTexas Despite the heated rhetoric from the Democrats Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle DSD refused to declare the Bush plan deadonarrival Obviously there is a lot there that we can work together on Were hopeful that we can do that Daschle said Outside interest groups will have a big influence on how the debate unfolds and on molding public perceptions of the Bush plan Environmentalists vowed to join Democrats in a sustained attack that includ es rallies advertising and attentiongrabbing stunts like the coal dumping at Cheneys residence which was orchestrated by Greenpeace Cheney led the White House task force that developed the energy policy We are going to continue keeping up the pressure on the BushCheney administration over the summer because we think this is going to be a hot issue said Greenpeace spokesman Gary Skulnik Supporters of the Bush plan in the business community including energy companies have organized the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth to counter the environmentalists message and lobby for the Bush plan What this country needs to do is diversify its energy portfolio Weve got a huge challenge in front of us said Bruce Josten executive vice president for government affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce Bush warns country about California By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May ST PAUL Minn President Bush took to the road Thursday to sound dire warnings about a darker future for the nation if it fails to follow his path of more oil drilling and nuclear plants After touring a power plant fired with new technology the president urged the country to rally around his justunveiled energy plan or risk seeing power problems now plaguing California spread If we fail to act this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in California he said If we fail to act Americans will face more and more widespread blackouts If we fail to act our country will become more reliant on foreign crude oi l putting our national energy security into the hands of foreign nations som e of whom do not share our interests And he added if we fail to act our environment will suffer as government officials struggle to prevent blackouts in the only way possible by calling on more polluting emergency backup generators and by running le ss efficient old power plants too long and too hard But trying to build support for the report previewed the night before by White House officials and to stay ahead of the criticism of some of it s politically controversial recommendations the president also sounded a n optimistic note that stressed technology and conservation as the keys to avoiding Californias missteps Bush called for a new harmony between our energy needs and our environment al concerns arguing that energy development and environmental protection wer e not at odds He made only passing references to the reports proposals to drill in an Arctic wildlife refuge bury the nuclear power industrys waste and commandeer private lands in order to expand interstate electricity transmission grids Proposals such as those have aroused the ire of many Democrats and environmentalists who charge Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney the reports main author with using the energy situation as a pretext to give an economic boost to the energy industry that made them wealthy Meanwhile Bush cited his own roster of villains President Clinton Ir aqs Saddam Hussein and California He noted pointedly that the nation beginning in the early s made strides in energy efficiency but declared that this improvement slowed in the s during the Clinton administration He also defended his proposal to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by noting that doing so would produce barrels a day for the next years He added That happens to be exactly the amount we import from Saddam Husseins Iraq Bush started his visit here by dropping by a power facility that combines innovative heat and power technologies to burn coal natural gas oil and renewable wood biomass to provide lowcost heating to large buildings a nd singlefamily residences in downtown St Paul Minn and adjacent area s In his speech Bush referred to the facility and noted other technological advances that have led to a solar powered house that produces more energy than it uses and to hybrid cars that can convert to battery power to redu ce emissions and get up to miles per gallon These are our early glimpses of a future in which Americans will meet our energy needs in ways that are efficient clean convenient and affordable That future is achievable if we make the right choices now Later he praised the state as an impressive conservation leader but added California has not built a major new power plant in a decade And n ot even the most admirable conservation effort could keep up with the states demand Bush argued that his plan will speed up progress on conservation where it has slowed and restart it where it has faltered At the same time he described the report as an effort to cut through the federal governments regulatory regime to make it possible for Americans to reap conservations rewards Warning that the countrys growing dependence on foreign oil sources poses a national security threat Bush described technology as a way out of the dilemma and added New technology makes drilling for oil more productive a s well as environmentally friendly than it was or years ago Bush argued that the renewal and expansion of existing nuclear facilities can generate tens of thousands of megawatts of electricity at a reasonable cost without pumping a gram of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere Reprising one of his signature campaign promises Bush said Just as we ne ed a new tone in Washington we also need a new tone in discussing energy and the environment one that is less suspicious less punitive less ranco rous Weve yelled at each other enough Gov Davis attacks Bush energy plan By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS May SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis attacked President Bushs energy plan Thurs day accusing the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state The Democratic governor said Bushs pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities offers no shortterm relief for Californias rolling blackouts and record power bills By not doing anything Bush is allowing the price gouging energy companies many of whom reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said Californians wants to know if Bush is going to be on their side Davis said Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others on the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal tha t the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer With little notice the outages have swept through the state snapping off power to home s and businesses from San Francisco to San Diego Bush announced his longterm energy plan Thursday in St Paul Minn and h e has yet to visit California the state in the grips of the nations worst energy crisis But shortly into the speech Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on t he light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his page energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of t he good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Davis agreed that California is likely only the first state to experience a power crisis Were the first one in line to suffer We want to look out for the interes ts of other states that could be affected in a year or two he said He urged the president to look at creative solutions such as ordering th e power generators to refund some of the recent high wholesale power prices His long term approach is basically ontrack but for those of us who are in immediate peril it offers no relief Davis said California is in danger of spiraling into a recession because of the high wholesale energy costs are literally dragging down our economy he said California Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte said he thinks the president s plan will help California particularly in helping to speed construction of new power plants Brulte said its a mistake for California to blame Bush and the federal government for its problems Gov Davis and his administration made significant mistakes on this energy issue and rather than trying to find a solution hes playing the political blame game Brulte said Carter recalls an energy crisis that was far worse By Calvin Woodward ASSOCIATED PRESS May WASHINGTON Less than two weeks into his presidency Jimmy Carter donne d a sweater and went on TV to tell Americans they should turn down their thermostats and learn to live thriftily Now nearly a quarter century after the energy crisis that dogged him Cart er says Thursdays problems are not so bad No energy crisis exists now that equates in any way with those we faced in and Carter said Thursday in an article in The Washington Post He noted that world energy supplies are adequate and stable and automobil es arent waiting in line at service stations President Bush released his energy plan Thursday emphasizing the need to increase production and proposing incentives for energy to be used more efficiently He is not proposing the tough efficiency standards or penalties for energy waste that Carter fought for But the former Democratic president said Bush does not have as big a problem on his hands Two major oil crises struck the US economy in the s first in and then in the late s during Carters presidency as major oil export ers reacted to the Iran hostage crisis causing gas station lineups and high prices Carter was defeated in partly because of fallout from the energy crisis Now he says Bush should seek a balance between conservation and new energy production just as he did Although Carters plan was known mostly for its push to curb demand he als o acted to spur coal production and speed the approval of nuclear power plant s as well as encourage alternative energy Carter in his column also renewed his opposition to Bushs plans to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge In Carter signed a law that protected the refuges millionacre coastal plain where the oil i s while opening percent of Alaskas coastal areas to oil exploration Carter wrote that some officials are using misinformation and scare tactic s to justify such environmental atrocities as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge He added that drilling advocates are careful to conceal the facts that almost none of the electricity in energytroubled California is generated from oil In his February address to the nation Carter said the energy shortage s could be dealt with if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifices if we learn to live thriftily and remember the importance of helping our neighbors Then in April he declared the moral equivalent of war on the energy crisis and outlined tough measures including a tax on gasguzzling cars Governor signs bill on energy authority Legislation allows state to build plants By Bill Ainsworth and Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS May SACRAMENTO Declaring California at war with pricegouging energy producers Gov Gray Davis signed legislation yesterday that he said would allow the state to fight back by building its own power plants Were retaking control of our own energy destiny Davis said The power will be generated here It will stay here and it will be made available to the people of California at reasonable prices The bill is the most farreaching legislation sparked by the energy crisis Many cities including Los Angeles and Sacramento have publicly owned utility districts but the state has never owned or operated plants on a large scale The legislation which takes effect in days creates a state power authority that can finance build or seize plants and is controlled by four appointees of the governor and the state treasurer Its modeled on a New York agency that operates power plants Californias new authority could issue up to billion in bonds to pay for the construction of new plants The bonds would be paid off by revenue from the power produced by the plants The goal of the new state authority is to break the states dependence on electricity imports controlled largely by outofstate companies Californi a imports percent of its electricity Davis said he believes the authority could start building peaker plants by September Such plants operate when power demand is at its highest Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco who authored Senate Bill X said it would have the longest and most lasting impact on Californias ability to reduce electricity prices and end rolling blackouts State Treasurer Philip Angelides who sponsored the bill said it will hel p ensure that California is never again held hostage by an unregulated privat e energy market run amok Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks has derided the plan as socialism Davis said he was disappointed that no Republicans supported the bill sayi ng its a sign that they have retreated to their ideological point of view an d refuse to be problemsolvers At the news conference Davis said a California Energy Commission report shows huge increases in the number of power plants out of service in the first four months of over a similar period last year To me this is strong evidence that people are manipulating the market by withholding the power to drive up prices he said Energy producers have denied withholding power saying they are maintaining their aging plants because they have to operate them longer and harder to provide California with more power Davis called on power companies to run their plants during the summer when blackouts are expected routinely or face the penalties If they dont act responsibly and do everything in their power to help us get through the summer which means operating at full capacity then Ill have no choice but to sign a windfall profits tax and seize a plant he said To curb soaring power costs two Assembly members introduced a resolution urging Davis to form a buyers cartel with Oregon and Washington to limit t he price the three states will pay for power Assemblymen Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek and Paul Koretz DWest Hollywood said the buyers of power must act because federal regulators have refused t o cap the wholesale prices that generators can charge We will pay these power generators a fair price but we will no longer all ow ourselves to be cash cows Koretz said Davis said he would consider the plan The formation of a buyers cartel was proposed last month by a San Diego consumer group the Utility Consumers Action Network which also said the state should consider planned blackouts to give consumers time to prepare A generator spokesman said state officials should have begun planning earli er for choosing between paying high prices for power and more blackouts In a crisis I think this kind of decision has to be made said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum Its economic triage Meanwhile federal energy regulators whose reaction to Californias proble m has been criticized by state officials waded into the dispute over the rol e of smallcapacity generators yesterday The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed operators of the plants to sell electricity to third parties if they have more power than they need to meet their contracts But FERC did not approve a plan releasing the generators known as qualifying facilities from longterm contracts with the states two biggest utilities which have had trouble paying their bills California Governor Gray Davis had urged FERC to stay out of the issue saying state officials were working with small power producers and cogeneration plants to solve the problem State to review Escondido power plant plan UNIONTRIBUNE May ESCONDIDO The California Energy Commission was expected to start the day review period today for a megawatt power plant proposed for Enterprise Street Jonathan Brindle the assistant planning director told the City Council yesterday that CalPeak Power of San Diego had supplied all the necessary paperwork to the commission The commission has scheduled a public hearing for pm May in the City Council chambers To the dismay of Escondido officials CalPeak withdrew its application with the city recently and is seeking a state permit Escondido officials maintain that CalPeak will still have to obtain city approval but the commission has said it will have final say under an executive order signed by Gov Gray Davis PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion Power She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create artificial shortages An industry spokesman calls the accusation idiocy By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ Times Staff Writers State investigators have uncovered evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency working with the state attorney generals office is probing patterns of plant outages that have created artificial shortages particularly when the state has issued emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said in an interview at The Times And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce even when they were obligated to do so unde r special contracts with the state and utility companies Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough information for the PUC and attorney generals office to take legal action against the generators next month The exact nature of that action she sai d is still under review Lynch who is an attorney did not name specific suppliers or provide documentation of her assertions She said that information will remain confidential until court proceedings are undertaken Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark et in any unlawful way including orchestrating plant shutdowns They say the facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha t breakdowns are a recurring problem Lynch and Gov Gray Davis who has been particularly critical of outofstate generators have not suggested that every plant shutdown has been unwarranted In fact the governors top advisor on power plants released a stateme nt last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was justified and that the companys officials were accommodating State Atty Gen Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi nt investigation with the PUC A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyers office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wideranging probe of possible civil and criminal violations So far the attorney generals office has subpoenaed documents in categories from generators including records of plant operations pricing practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another about Californias power market Were looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair business practice laws Lockyer has told The Times Although he has not provided details of his offices findings he recently said the inquiry is beginning to get interesting Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass ed during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous subpoenaed records obtained after intense legal battles with the power companies In addition investigators have been entering plants where unplanned shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records Lync h said At times the investigators have been denied access and have had to exert legal pressure to get in she said The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices whic h have gone from a megawatthour in December to as high as last week I would argue its no accident Lynch said of the high prices That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the rules of Californias flawed deregulation program which allowed them to bu y power plants formerly run by the states three largest utilities Gary Ackerman a spokesman for a trade association of large power producers said Lynchs allegations were the height of idiocy The reason many plants have been down in recent months he said is th at power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe r demand He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman executive director of the Weste rn Power Trading Forum State analysts have argued however that power traders can reap extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power that is sold are so high According to Lynch investigators have found that some companies were more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat e the states power market She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern When operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage alertmeaning th at electricity reserves have dropped below plants that do not need repairs suddenly are yanked offline That she said aggravates the shortages and the cost of wholesale electricity soars Before December state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up prices primarily through bidding At the time the market was designed to p ay all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the states grid operato r That changed in December when new federal regulations restructured Californias wholesale power market to loosen price controls Lynch said Since then a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emergednot coincidental ly in my view she said Now she added the state has endured historically high levels of unplanned plant outages The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by utility companies because they have not been going off line at record levels Lynch said The California Energy Commission reported last week that the states electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several times higher than in the last two years A Times analysis of state data found that throughout the last two months about megawatts of production was offline more than a third of the peak power used in California on a typical day That has been about evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns By contrast shutdowns in the same period of and took only to megawatts offline Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electrici ty supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise prices The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any wrongdoing However FERC released a study in February of closures at three other California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcit y of power After talking to plant operators by telephone reviewing documents and visiting the three plants federal inspectors concluded that the companies appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generatin g facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and incurring additional expenses Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark Effect Presidents energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the powerdeprived Golden State By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS Times Staff Writers California lawmakers analysts and others waistdeep in the states power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House energy plan By the time many of President Bushs proposals kick in it will be too late to do the Golden State much good This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the next critical months groused state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey You cant focus just on the long term here Because the patient will be de ad before we get the lifesupport systems in place Gov Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are draining Californias treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases Instead the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil increased reliance on nuclea r power and more than billion in tax credits for conservation and energy development Most of Bushs proposals however are slowacting remedies and many others already are being applied in California which was hit by energy woe s far ahead of other states The plans dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices experts say Overall the message in this plan is Drop dead California said Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased research and advocacy group I dont think it delivers another megawatt to California added Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the power crisis as an ongoing emergency rather than a temporary one Californias supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer once new power plants of them licensed in the pipelinestart churning Its not that we dont have longterm problems said Stephen Levy director of the Palo Altobased Center for Continuing Study of the Californ ia Economy Its just that energy isnt among them Others including many environmentalists say Bush could have made a noticeable impact by for example beefing up energy efficiency programsa quick clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand Why not provide aggressive incentives rebates to get people to purchase more efficient air conditioners asked Dan Reicher assistant Energy secretary in the Clinton administration Over the course of the yea r a program like that can make a dramatic difference because air conditionin g consumes nearly onethird of Californias peak energy supply Instead Reicher noted Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency standards for air conditioners a move that critics say will require the country to build new power plants Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California were clouded by doubt Bush for example directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to relieve a key transmission bottleneck known as Path between Northern and Southern California But he specified that the upgrade which requires building a mile line at an estimated cost of million be funded by nonfederal contributionsmeaning the financially strapped utilities migh t be expected to bear the cost Gov Davis who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from Washington said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an d criticized the president for allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of which reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said the state is doing everything possible to build and conser ve our way out of the problem but it desperately needs federal price control s on energy costs In California energy users spent about billion this year even with consumption down the bill could top billion But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney who led the task force that prepared the plan are opposed to price caps preferring to let market forc es reign Davis said that laissez faire approach puts Californias economy in peril Just saying over the long haul everything will work out is turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state Davis said Small businesses literally will go out of business because the y cant afford these rates Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California Bush recommends building power plants over the next yearsabout eight plants a month But California is already on a plantbuilding spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year s The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi ng for a renewed commitment to nuclear power The California governor however has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive order issued in February There is little evidence meanwhile that Californians are eager to approve an expansion in nuclear power Nationwide not one new nuclear plan t has been licensed in more than years And a Times Poll in February found that of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state You can barely build cleanburning gas plants here let alone nuclear plants said Edward Kahn a San Franciscobased energy consultant with Analysis GroupEconomics Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines Currently the US governments power to forcibly acquire private property applies only to highways and gas pipelines Expanding that power is likely to enrage property owners and propertyrights advocates who typically expect backing from Bushstyle conservatives Im just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the states authority over its own land said Lynch of the PUC The issue is already heated in California Communities in southwestern Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas Electrics attemp ts to use eminent domain to obtain private land for miles of transmission lines The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energ y officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for priva te

customers should not be deprived to aid others By SCOTT GOLD Times Staff Writer A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the federal government today to exempt them from blackouts Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in California and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled outjust as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages Most Californians pay large investorowned utilities like Southern California Edison Co for power But about a quarter of households from th e tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital are billed for electricit y by cities counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit utilities There are municipal utilities Four of themserving Los Angeles Burbank Glendale and the Imperial Valley east of San Diegoare independent of the state power grid and do n ot face any outages But the others are required by contract to give electrici ty back to the California Independent System Operator which runs the grid by participating in rolling blackoutsalthough they have plenty of power to serve their customers It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs said California Municipal Utilities Assn attorney Tony Braun These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions behind the deregulation of Californias electricity market and the power shortage We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and that we dont have the rightnor does anyone elseto take it away from th em when they need it said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans Our customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t o Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts Vernons public utility has customers all but of which are industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants T he city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state said Jorge Somoano Vernons assistant director of resource management FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the campaign Up to half including Riverside are expected to either file thei r own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon said Washington attorne y Bonnie Blair who represents municipal utilities in Azusa Banning and Colt on Even the campaigns supporters are unsure whether it will succeed Bla ir acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal challenge to FERC which is expected to decide on the issue by midJune An d she said municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don e enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis Some cities with municipal utilities such as Anaheim are not plannin g to join the campaign Marcie Edwards general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities said the relationships between municipal utilities and CalISO are too complicated t o make a clean break She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed entirely on the large investorowned utilitiesincluding this summers energy crunch And until that can be proved she said municipal utilities still have an obligation to support Californias power grid Its not right to go either way she said The fact remains th at municipals still have an obligation to serve Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through agreements with CalISO that call for them to share electricity in an emergency Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for natural disasters such as earthquakes or other sudden and monumental problems such as a plane running into a transmission line The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient supplies Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC does not constitute an emergency The obligation to share in rolling blackouts did not contemplate situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to provide resources to serve their customers Blair said If they are force d to participate in rolling blackouts the effect is that the ISO is taking energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it Jim Detmers CalISOs vice president of operations said the organization plans to fight the campaign He said emergency provisions of CalISOs agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy crunch Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha ve their own electricity distribution He compared the exemption request to a homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbors because he wants to kee p his water for himself What were dealing with is an overall shortage Detmers said We wa nt to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyones lives are at risk Ronald Nunnally Edisons director of federal regulations and contract s said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the power grid to which they are connected The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole if you will under all circumstances he said Blair said those arguments dont hold up Indeed she said the municip al utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits giving public property such as electricity bought by a municipal utility to a private enterprise such as investorowned electric companies Our customers are paying for it she said Thats the bottom line Californians fault Bush energy proposal GARY GENTILE AP Business Writer Friday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT LOS ANGELES AP Government officials environmental groups and many energy consumers found little comfort in President Bushs national energy plan released Thursday The plan which includes a pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities was sharply criticized by Gov Gray Davis who accused the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others to the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal tha t the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer Customers of t he states two largest private utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison will see unprecedented rate increases soon In announcing his plan Thursday Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on t he light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of t he good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Some consumers didnt see the presidents sympathy I dont really think he has my concerns as his priority said Jodi Reynolds a Culver City legal secretary I can already see that I need to conserve energy I dont need the president to tell me that Others gave Bush credit for addressing the nations longterm energy needs but faulted the president for not doing more for California now We give him kudos for addressing the supply issue said Brian Bennett vi ce president of external affairs for Southern California Edison one of the states cashstrapped electric utilities However when it comes to addressing the California crisis the Bush administration has chosen to ignore what they could have done to help lesse n the crisis here impose on a shortterm basis costbased pricing on the wholesale market That theme ran through some of the comments by the states environmental an d consumer groups In the last energy crisis a handful of nations in the Middle East had us over a barrel said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Now its a handful of energy companie s in the Southern United States The only solution is to bust the Texasbased OPEC Environmentalists said Bushs energy policy lacks proposals that could offe r shortterm relief from higher electricity and gasoline prices such as powe r price controls incentives for more efficient appliances and tighter fuelefficiency requirements for vehicles The Bush plan also steps away from assurances he made during the campaign that he would not rescind a moratorium on new offshore oil leases created b y his father and extended until by President Clinton The plan calls for the secretaries of commerce and the interior to reexamine the moratorium We are concerned what he is stepping toward said Allison Detmer manager of the ocean and resources unit of the state Coastal Commission which is suing the federal government over the existing leases This might be the first step toward opening up the coast again Some utility and government officials said Bush correctly focused on expanding the nations energy infrastructure building more natural gas pipelines and strengthening the electricity transmission grid But the presidents support for new nuclear power plants won little support The political realities in California are were not going to see an increased reliance to nuclear power in the near future said Carl Wood a member of the California Public Utilities Commission Perhaps predictably state Democrats found little to like in Bushs plan while Republicans found much to praise The presidents plan will help California this summer by expediting new power plants and ordering state agencies to conserve said Rep

painless Conservation does not mean doing without Bush said citing such things a s smart electric meters on homes and sensors that switch off lights when people leave a room Wise regulation and American innovation will make thi s country the worlds leader in energy efficiency and conservation in the s t century Bushs conciliatory language was a twist on former President Bill Clintons oftused

intense effort to kill the presidents plan Bush creates a thin veil of energy efficiency to hide a cesspool of political giveaways to the energy industry said Dan Becker of the Sierra Club Sen Dianne Feinstein and nearly every other Democrat in the California delegation attacked the plan as doing nothing to aid California urging electricity price controls instead For Big Oil and other suppliers the Bush energy plan is a dream come true Feinstein said But among those most left behind are the people and businesses of California who have been under siege by electricity and natur al gas marketers bent on gouging every cent they can Environmentalists said the plan offered only a sorry sop to conservation an d avoided calling for higher fuelefficiency standards on sport utility vehicles Yet like both political parties environmental leaders also avoided pressin g for public sacrifices Most people didnt buy an SUV because they wanted to spend a lot of money on gasoline said Philip Clapp president of the National Environmental Trust It is not a consumer choice to buy inefficient SUVs PLANS PROSPECTS IN CONGRESS The Bush plan is likely to ignite a freeforall in Congress to divvy up benefits among competing energy sources ranging from coal and nuclear power to wind and biomass Tax credits for green fuels such as solar and geothermal are wildly popular in both parties Regional interests split the parties on other issues from greater use of coal and oil to higher auto fuelefficiency standards opposed by many representatives in automaking states but favored by New England Republicans Both parties agree with Bush on encouraging construction of a huge pipeline to bring natural gas from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to the lower states Alliances are likely between Democrats and moderate Republicans on more conservation and higher efficiency standards which have broad support Bushs controversial proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refu ge faces a

in the s when President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal developed the Tennessee Valley Authority which built dams and generated billion kilowatt hours of electricity and the Bonneville pow er project on the Columbia River which supplies the Pacific Northwest and California with electricity New energy policies and debates about national resources seem to come and g o like the tide Here is a look at presidents and their policies Dwight Eisenhower In World War II the United States developed the most fearsome of all energ y sources nuclear fission Nuclear weapons killed at least people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and held the world under the threat of destructio n In December of President Eisenhower in his famous Atoms for Peace speech at the United Nations proposed an international pool for the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear power One result Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act of for a public private development of nuclear power The Navy developed nuclear submarines but only one nuclear civilian ship the freighter Savannah was ever built It was not a success Lyndon Johnson The Johnson years are more remembered for his Great Society programs and th e war in Vietnam but it was also a boom time for commercial nuclear power However there were growing questions about safety and disposal of waste In came the great blackout a massive power failure on the East Coast the first sign of a major energy problem Richard Nixon Nixon was the first president to send an energy message to Congress His message sounds eerily familiar He said the country could not take its ener gy supply for granted He wanted a department of natural resources but the pl an went nowhere since gas was cheap and so was electricity In Nixon asked for a department of energy An Arab oil boycott

had been solved in March In August he resigned Jimmy Carter The energy problem was one of the overwhelming factors that spoiled Carter s presidency Carter who had emphasized his role as a nuclear engineer announced an era of limits on American energy use He asked Americans to sa ve energy and to turn down the heat His famous television address on energy which showed the President wearing a

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive B UDTLtypeDnews Included in the Bush administrations page energy plan is a call for ta x credits to spur the development of biomass a form of energy generation tha t spans everything from oldstyle wood burning to futuristic processes such a s extracting ethanol from agricultural waste Although Bush envisions biomass playing a tiny role in solving the nations immediate energy woes highlevel support for the technology could be important for two California industries biotechnology and agriculture Sharon Shoemaker director of the California Institute of Food and Agricultural Research at the University of California at Davis is a proponent of using biotechnology to reinvent biomass as an industry The ai m is to extract clean energy and mineral byproducts from plant waste while giving distressed farmers a new market for harvest leftovers Theres no commercial biomass plant like this out there yet but were just on the verge of making it happen said Shoemaker who will hold a biomass conference at Davis in June Californias biomass industry which contributes about percent of the states electricity is based primarily on burning waste wood from sawmills forests and orchards The keys to reinventing biomass are genetically engineered bacteria and bioengineered enzymes that can turn cellulose the material that gives plants their strength into ethanol in a process similar to fermenting grain or grapes into alcohol In addition to producing ethanol to blend with gasoline new biomass breweries would extract valuable minerals from plants and even convert the cellulose in plant waste into plastic substitutes Some of our members are making shirts that feel like polyester but theyr e made from corn not oil said Megan Smith with the American Bioenergy Association a Washington DC lobby whose members include the Palo Alto biotech firm Genencor International After ethanol and mineral byproducts have been extracted from plant waste biomass plants would burn the remaining material called lignin the substance found in peat bogs Left alone over geologic time lignin would compress and turn into coal Evidence of Bushs interest in biomass surfaced earlier this year when the administration slashed research budgets for alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power but barely touched biomass research Some of that money came to Northern California biotech firms Genencor and Novozymes Biotech in Davis each recently won competing million research contracts to cut the expense of turning cellulose into ethanol Today the enzymes used in the process cost cents per gallon of ethanol produced Novozymes President Glenn Nedwin said We want to get it down t o cents a gallon From political and policy viewpoints Bushs affinity for biomass is clear Gregg Morris director of the Green Power Institute a Berkeley nonprofit that performs alternative energy research recalled a recent ethanol conference in Las Vegas One of the agricultural lobby guys said that whenever he visits administration officials he brings a map that shows which states voted for Bush Morris said The map showed solid Republican support in the farmbel t states that would benefit most from biomass techniques that provide new markets for field waste The policy rationale for biomass energy was laid out in a article titl ed The New Petroleum that appeared in the influential journal Foreign Affair s The authors Sen Richard Lugar RInd and former CIA Director James Woolsey warned that America was headed for economic disaster and another Gulf War unless it reduced oil imports The vehicle they said was to use biotechnology to turn abundant farm waste into ethanol If genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced processing technologie s can make a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels affordable the worlds security picture could be different in many ways they said making anothe r oil embargo or Mideast war less likely The nation annually consumes about billion gallons of gasoline and produces about billion gallons of ethanol The new biomass fever must be tempered by recognition that todays biomass industry is controversial and subsidized and the futuristic processing plants envisioned by boosters exist only in the pilot stage California for instance has biomass plants in operation fueled primarily by wood waste Morris said An equal number of biomass plants has been idled or dismantled for a variety of reasons including a lack of wood for fuel The fastest way to ramp up the wood supply would be thinning the states forests but that could stir environmental opposition Morris said In the Midwest biomass has a different though no less controversial meaning In the grainproducing states biomass means turning corn kernels into ethanol The same kernels that might get popped in the movie theater o r fed to the livestock are instead put through an ethanol conversion plant Two factors make this possible First corn kernels are rich in starch whi ch is relatively easy to ferment The stalks and the cobs which contain the cellulose so valued in biomass dreams are thrown away because they aren t economical to convert Second and steeped in controversy is a centpergallon federal subsidy that helps put it on par with competing petroleum products Free market groups such as the Cato Institute in Washington DC have attacke d this as a handout to the corn belt that primarily benefits one company Archer Daniels Midland the nations leading ethanol producer Backers of the new biomass are counting on that subsidy to help support the challenging task of taking ethanol from cellulose waste Without the cent agallon subsidy the corn ethanol industry wouldnt be here today said Mike Bryan of BBI Associates a Colorado firm that conducts feasibilit y studies for ethanol plants The cellulose ethanol industry will need simil ar support for a while Although much of the talk about biomass centers on futuristic applications the newest aspect of the Bush energy plan benefits the oldest form of bioma ss burning waste to generate power Smith the Bioenergy Association lobbyist said Bush has proposed giving biomass power generators access to an existing but unused tax credit of cents per kilowatt hour When Congress enacted the credit in it was intended for biomass generators who burned plant matter specifically grown to harvest as fuel This has cost the treasury nothing because nobody does it said Morris the Green Power expert in Berkeley Bush has proposed making this credit available to biomass furnaces that bur n waste wood something that would benefit California biomass generators Seeking a renewable resource President Bushs energy plan calls for tax credits to promote the developme nt of biomassbased fuels Biomass systems use bacteria or heat to convert far m waste into energy and products The Iowa Energy Center project is using cornstalks Heres a look inside the demonstration

Tom Abate at Todays energy shortages far less ominous than in frantic s Posted at pm PDT Thursday May KEN MORITSUGU WASHINGTON As President Bush unveiled his energy plan Thursday nearly new power plants were under construction across the United States and drilling rigs were burrowing for new sources of natural gas Todays high energy prices and shortages are driving massive energyindustr y investments that over time with or without government intervention wi ll bring supplies up and prices down To call the current situation a crisis is an exaggeration with the excepti on of the severe electricity shortage in California that all but guarantees temporary blackouts this summer and possibly next It pales in comparison with the s crises that forced motorists to line up for limited gasoline supplies and drove the US economy into recession Theres an electricity crisis in California said Paul Krugman a Princeton University economist Nothing else out there justifies talking about a crisis Energy demand surged in the late s and the capacity for delivering and refining the stuff didnt keep up basically because produce rs were caught by surprise So we have high prices by recent standards but al l that will solve itself That does not mean there are not serious energy issues facing the nation including bottlenecks in making gasoline from crude oil and delivering electricity over heavily burdened transmission lines and natural gas throug h nearly full pipelines But even todays high gasoline prices when adjusted for inflation are percent lower than their historic peak in Consumers enjoyed a period of extremely low energy prices for most of the s Such depressed prices wont return anytime soon Instead homeowners and drivers are likely to be saddled with higher prices for gasoline heati ng oil and natural gas for months and maybe a few years While higher energy costs always pose a threat to the overall economy its a much more distant one today than in the s Then oil prices soared percent in a year and the impact rippled through gasoline and electricity markets By comparison energy costs rose percent last year and are projected to rise an additional percent this year according to DRIWEFA a Lexington Mass economicforecasting firm Were better off today because we have a much more diversified energy supply said Jim Osten chief energy economist at DRIWEFA The country is much less dependent on oil particularly for electricity generation where the use of coal nuclear and more recently natural gas ha s expanded Also conservation has helped contain though it hasnt stopped the growth in energy use The one risk is California In the end disaster probably will be avoided but its going to be nasty Krugman said Outside California the outlook is much less bleak Power companies have built or significantly expanded power plants in the past months according to Resource Data International a Boulder Colobased energyinformation and consulting firm An additional are under construction up from this time a year ago That pace of construction is enough to meet the upper end of the Bush administrations estimate that the country will need to new pow er plants over the next years We are on the right road and we are building up front a lot of what is needed over the year period said Judah Rose managing director of wholesale power at ICF Consulting a Fairfax Vabased energyconsulting firm Richmond Vabased Dominion sees no power shortages in its markets in Nort h Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia said Thomas Capps the companys president Likewise the naturalgas market is adjusting to recent supply shortages th at drove up prices last winter when the weather turned unusually cold As of last week there were rigs drilling for gas in the United States up fr om up from a year ago and two years ago according to a weekly survey by Baker Hughes Inc a Houstonbased maker of drilling equipment As the price rises theres economic incentive to drill more said Gary Flaharty director of investor relations for Baker Hughes Eventually youll drill to the point where there is enough gas on the market and the price will come down Still future gas supply will have to keep up with new demand from the construction boom in power plants the vast majority of which are powered b y natural gas To meet that expected demand most analysts support construction of a proposed pipeline to bring in new supplies of natural gas from Alaska Bush also has proposed opening previously restricted federal lands in the Rockies to exploration for natural gas While environmental concerns surrou nd these areas economists say there is enough of a projected need for natural gas that they should not be written off without review We need a coherent set of policies for deciding on when and how access to federal lands will be opened up to gas and oil exploration and development said Paul Joskow director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Polic y Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology This inevitably involves a careful assessment of the environmental consequences of exploration and development in particular areas and research and developmen t on ways to minimize environmental damage Ultimately the problem may not be finding natural gas or generating electricity but getting those products to where they are needed New pipelines and electric transmission lines need to be built to keep up with the nations growing appetite for power In many cases local oppositi on has blocked construction Also uncertainty surrounding what the rules will be for electricity deregulation has reduced the incentives to build transmission lines while increasing the risks I think the power plants will get built

swift action to turn Bushs proposals into law but hard fights lie ahead Democrats and environmentalists condemn the plan as a sellout to Big Oil Many of the proposals pit powerful interest groups against each other along lines they have fought over bitterly for decades And energy politics typically split the nation by region as fuelproducing Sun Belt states are often in conflict with pricesensitive consumers in Frost Belt states Even Bushs allies concede that Congress is likely to reject his proposal t o drill for oil and gas in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Other flash points of controversy include his proposals To give the federal government authority to erect power lines on private land To consider easing cleanair restrictions on old coalfired electric plant s To possibly pursue energy exploration in federal lands in the Rocky Mountains and coastal waters that are now off limits To boost reliance on nuclear power The president said his recommendations would

administration had planned to spend over years for renewableenergy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energyefficient products like hybrid cars But the estimated

groups and many energy consumers found little comfort in President Bushs national energy plan released Thursday The plan which includes a pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities was sharply criticized by Gov Gray Davis who accused the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others to the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal th at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer Customers of t he states two largest private utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison will see unprecedented rate increases soon In announcing his plan Thursday Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on the light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Some consumers didnt see the presidents sympathy I dont really think he has my concerns as his priority said Jodi Reynolds a Culver City legal secretary I can already see that I nee d to conserve energy I dont need the president to tell me that Others gave Bush credit for addressing the nations longterm energy needs but faulted the president for not doing more for California now We give him kudos for addressing the supply issue said Brian Bennett vice president of external affairs for Southern California Edison one of t he states cashstrapped electric utilities However when it comes to addressing the California crisis the Bush administration has chosen to ignore what they could have done to help lesse n the crisis here impose on a shortterm basis costbased pricing on the wholesale market That theme ran through some of the comments by the states environmental an d consumer groups In the last energy crisis a handful of nations in the Middle East had us over a barrel said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpaye r and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Now its a handful of energy compani es in the Southern United States The only solution is to bust the Texasbased OPEC Environmentalists said Bushs energy policy lacks proposals that could offe r shortterm relief from higher electricity and gasoline prices such as powe r price controls incentives for more efficient appliances and tighter fuelefficiency requirements for vehicles The Bush plan also steps away from assurances he made during the campaign that he would not rescind a moratorium on new offshore oil leases created b y his father and extended until by President Clinton The plan calls for the secretaries of commerce and the interior to reexamine the moratorium We are concerned what he is stepping toward said Allison Detmer manag er of the ocean and resources unit of the state Coastal Commission which is suing the federal government over the existing leases This might be the first step toward opening up the coast again Some utility and government officials said Bush correctly focused on expanding the nations energy infrastructure building more natural gas pipelines and strengthening the electricity transmission grid But the presidents support for new nuclear power plants won little support The political realities in California are were not going to see an increased reliance to nuclear power in the near future said Carl Wood a member of the California Public Utilities Commission Perhaps predictably state Democrats found little to like in Bushs plan while Republicans found much to praise The presidents plan will help California this summer by expediting new power plants and ordering state agencies to conserve said Rep Randy Cunningham REscondido Theres nothing in there for California Nothing said Rep Brad Sherma n DLos Angeles The headline is Bush to California drop dead Bush says the right stuff Published Friday May in the San Jose Mercury News PRESIDENT Bush may tour innovative power plants and put conservation first in his energy speeches but until the money and the regulations back up the rhetoric well suspect him of being a fossilfuel kind of guy Bush covered the spectrum of energy options in the muchawaited plan he released Thursday more conservation more supply more wires and pipes to get the power to the people All must play a part But Bushs background in the oil business and the rol e of energy producers in drafting the plan foster the impression that hes mo st enthusiastic about loosening the environmental leash on the oil coal and nuclear industries A failure to act Bush repeatedly implied would leave the nation in the sa me straits as California now finds itself The comparison is inexact California would have benefited from better ener gy planning five years ago But the current shortage has little to do with environmental obstacles to new plants or a lack of fuel Its caused by a dysfunctional market On that score Bush continued to reject the one federal action wholesale price controls that might help California get through the summer without paying a kings ransom for electricity California would benefit in the years to come from Bushs call for improvements in the transmission system for gas and electricity Retrofitti ng and expanding an aging network would provide both more energy and greater flexibility in its distribution Underlying Bushs plan is the thesis that fossil fuels will remain central to Americas energy supply for decades to come That may be true But the role of national energy policy is not primarily to augment the supply of fuels t he free market already easily provides Burning fossil fuels creates smog and global warming The government ought to be leading the search for ways to squeeze more energy from fossil fuels and for alternatives to them Whether from conviction or from the backlash over Vice President Cheneys recent disparagement of living with less Bush offered some plans to improv e efficiency and conservation Hed spend billion on tax credits for the purchase of gasolineelectric hybrid cars In all billion in tax credi ts would stimulate conservation Drafting the federal budget for next year however Bush cut research on energy efficiency by a third and on renewable fuels by half On one obvious target for greater efficiency mileage standards for cars Bushs energy plan is far too timid proposing only to study them America has been backsliding on fuelefficiency stricter standards are overdue Bush seeks instead to find more fuel to put in the tank Hed drill in th e Arctic Wildlife Refuge a needless environmental insult that Congress thankfully is unlikely to countenance With revisions in a host of environmental regulations Bush would make it easier to extract oil or natural gas from public lands or under coastal waters Exploitation of natural resources is last centurys energy policy The domestic resource Bush should be exploiting more

energy companies and the construction of multibillion dollar boondoggles like nuclear power all of which will benefit the same energy companies that are holding California hostage With BushCheney Plan Crisis History Repeats Itself FTCR noted that the last energy crisis to strike America was inspired not by supply shortages but by greed of the OPEC nations which in the s us ed their control of petroleum supplies to create shortages and massive price hikes American energy companies took advantage to profit from their resources as well In response the US Congress passed a thenstaggering multibillion dolla r billion package of tax breaks and grants to the energy industry to build po wer plants that would manufacture synthetic fuels These plants ultimately became taxpayerfunded

Glynn brushed off the scorn of shareholders burned by the companys bankrupt utility during a prickly annual meeting that ended with three consumer activists being dragged out of the auditorium by security officers Throughout out the twohour meeting Glynn repeatedly sought to reassure the sometimes hostile audience of nearly people that the San Franciscobased company remained a solid longterm investment despite the bankruptcy of its main revenue source Pacific Gas and Electric He repeated previous promises that the company intends to recover most if not all of its dlrs billion in unreimbursed electricity expenses accumulated since May allowing the utility to regain its financial footing and repay its more than creditors The company is seeking rulings in bankruptcy court and other legal venues that might open the door for the utility to retroactively charge its customers for abovemarket electricity bought from June through February of this year We are not seeking a

summer Power Politics In Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Avidly Than Ever CEO Lay Leaves an Imprint On Bush Energy Plan Seeks Friends at FERC An Interstate for Electricity By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhou r with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among othe r things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled yesterday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says h e sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energ y companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and ga s monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they nee d the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensu re that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it want s those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annua l stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy a nd you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwat er overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market powe r of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he cal ls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout a nd riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owne d by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesal e energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quick ly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a frien d of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened the ir networks to competitors For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utilit y regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aide s Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any M s Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathit t through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but tha t she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restauran t in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendl y with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford He s been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enro n according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In Apr il when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won th e presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr L ay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishin g or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged i n March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House politic al adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reduction s in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White House officials Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison In both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all The Cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity As Enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them An effort to make the grid national would enhance FERCs power as Enron has urged The report is mum on some Enron concerns such as requiring utilities to jo in regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utilit y industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involve d in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western stat es and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevad a repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states o r perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the t wo chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framewo rk the governors might want to consider Though Mr Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr Racicot had joined the Washingto n DC lobbying firm Bracewell Patterson Mr Racicot didnt disclose that he was on retainer to Enron and the star of Enrons Western states advocacy team For his part Mr Racicot says he was working not at Enrons direction but with their knowledge to advance positions that he too feels are important Jeffrey White contributed to this article National Desk Section A THE ENERGY PLAN THE OVERVIEW BUSH PUSHING ENERGY PLAN OFFERS SCORES OF PROPOSALS TO FIND NEW POWER SOURCES By DAVID E SANGER with JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company NEVADA Iowa May President Bush began an intensive effort today to sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the American people arguing that the country had a future of energy abundance if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between energy producers and environmental advocates Mr Bushs plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals many that he can impose by executive order for finding new sources of power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies His critics swarmed over the specifics noting that the plan set no targets for improved energy efficiency offered no shortterm relief for outofcontrol electricity prices in the West and provided only modest financing for research into clean energy technology The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near St Paul that burns a variety of fuels including oil coal and waste wood to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day The parties in the energ y debate have yelled at each other enough Mr Bush said Now its time to listen to each other Excerpts Page A Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection Mr Bush added before flying here to a farmin g town north of Des Moines to continue his argument at a small biomass plant that makes power by burning materials derived from animal waste and plants As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about Americas energy future as if the people who produce Americas energy do n ot care about the planet their children will inherit Mr Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political thread arguing that if America failed to act now this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California Mr Bush also said rising energy prices had put an intolerable burden on families and farmers But some of the statistics in his own report seemed t o undercut that claim One chart showed that the share of disposable househol d income spent on energy had declined to less than percent today from percent during the early days of the Reagan administration That percentag e has begun to rise again but only to the levels of the mids before a sharp drop in energy prices Mr Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail raising the specter of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreig n oil suppliers He argued for example that the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve which he wants to open to drilling can produce barrels of oil a day for the next years That happens to be exactly the amount th e United States now imports from Iraq he said Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention wit h Democrats and some moderate Republicans many of whom argue that the Bush administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuel s at the expense of the environment Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced approach it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and conservation America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies said Senator Joseph I Lieberman Democrat of Connecticut The energy crisis i s not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis Republicans offered far more support for the president Senator Frank H Murkowski of Alaska chairman of the Senate Energy Committee said he plann ed hearings next week to begin consideration of recommendations in the Bush report that require legislative action Not everyone is going to like this plan Mr Murkowski said but at least now we have a plan to kick around He said the previous administration had failed to grapple with the nations energy sources through a comprehensive plan Clinton administration officia ls disputed the assertion and blamed Congress for failing to enact energy legislation Yet even Mr Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Mr Bushs approach He said the report offered few immediate remedies for Californias electricity crisis or for rising gasoline prices He said Republicans might have to consider a gastax rollback or the temporary suspension of some environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks Mr Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a longterm energy polic y His report contained initiatives although many of them are endorsements of actions already in place And while in his public comments he always started with talk of conservation the report itself was much more specific when it came to tapping new supplies No matter how much we conserve were still going to need more energy he said here this afternoon The State of California is the second best stat e at conservation and yet they are still running out of energy Among those who took a different view was former president Jimmy Carter wh o wrote in The Washington Post this morning that the United States did not confront an energy crisis comparable to those of and World supplies are adequate and reasonably stable price fluctuations are cyclical reserves are plentiful he argued Mr Carter said exaggerate d claims seem designed to promote some longfrustrated ambitions of the oil industry at the expense of environmental quality Some chapters of the energy plan resemble the annual reports issued by ener gy companies with color photos of bears living happily in the wilderness forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and flyfishermen wading in pristine water practicing the favorite sport of the reports main author Vice President Dick Cheney While the report clinically assessed all the available sources of energy an d promised to encourage development of those that do the least environmental damage it fell far short of describing the moonshot approach to efficienc y and renewable energy that was an ambition of the Carter years In fact federal spending on research and development of wind solar geothermal and biomass energy sources as well as on energy efficiency technology has never equaled the billion spent in Mr Carters final year in office even after adjustments for inflation If the Bush plan were fully put into effect it would potentially double wh at the administration had planned to spend over years for renewable energy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energyefficient products like hybrid cars But the estimated billion commitment over that period is below what the Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some cuttingedge energy technologies commonplace Americans spend billion a year on energy said John Holdren an energy and environmental policy expert at Harvard who helped draft a Clinto n administration study of clean energy sources The Bush people are proposi ng to change habits by incentives that amount to about onetenth of one percen t of that amount each year Its not very significant Though the report devotes more chapters and more recommendations to measure s related to the environment conservation and renewable energy than those related to traditional sources the impact of what the administration intend s to do to increase traditional energy supplies greatly outweighs what it aspires to do to diminish demand The report notes that efficiency in homes and offices could help reduce the need for new power plants which it says must total at least by But it adopts no goal for such improvements In the same manner addressing auto efficiency standards the report review s how Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates improved the performance of combustion engines in the s But it puts off any decision on whether t o raise those standards now saying the administration would wait for a study to be completed The report is far less tentative in the area regulations it identifies as hindering the oil gas nuclear and utility industries It mentions about a dozen areas including landuse restrictions in the Rockies lease stipulations on offshore areas attractive to oil companies the vetting of locations for nuclear plants environmental reviews to upgra de power plants and refineries that could be streamlined or eliminated to help industry find more oil and gas and produce more electricity and gasoline California where soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts have bee n the main contributor to the idea that the nation faces on energy crisis ge ts little in the Bush plan The report notes that federal agencies have been asked to reduce peak power use in California in coming months but that is far less than California officials want Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California called the plan a bible for longterm energy production and not even a pamphlet for the urgent shortterm actions needed to help us get out of the crisis in her home state She particularly criticized Mr Bushs refusal to call for electrici ty price caps in California In what seems likely to be one of its most contested recommendations the Bush team recommends creating a national electricity grid akin to the interstate highway system and giving federal agencies the right to take la nd for electricity transmission by eminent domain That proposal has already come under attack by Western governors and is sure to be a battle in Congress Photos President Bush Christie Whitman head of the Environmental Protection Agency and Mayor Norm Coleman of St Paul second from right with officials of a power plant that burns

Washington Post FINAL Page A Copyright The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved ST PAUL Minn May President Bush unveiled his muchanticipated energy policy to the nation today from the banks of the Mississippi River warning of widespread misery if Congress resists his plan to increase the countrys power production Bush flew to a convention center here to announce his proposals after fo ur months of deliberations winning acclaim from Republicans and the energy industry which stands to make billions of dollars from his ideas and complaints from Democrats and environmentalists who hope to exploit the policy as a way to portray the president a former Texas oilman as a captive of industry If we fail to act Americans will face more and more widespread blackouts Bush said America cannot allow that to be our future and we will not The president adding a tone of urgency to his longterm proposals said a future without new sources of energy is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in t he great state of California In California Gov Gray Davis D accused the administration of turnin g a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state He excoriated Bush for refusing to cap wholesale energy prices We are literally in a war with energy companies many of which reside in Texas Davis said The White House today released the full page report which provides more detail but follows closely the outline Bush advisers introduced Wednesday night Bush seeks reduced regulations to encourage more oil gas and nuclea r production tax incentives to boost coal output and other tax incentives aimed at conservation and renewable fuels The president said the nation needs to new power plants over the next years and additional miles of natural gas pipelines and miles of distribution lines Some of the proposals notably the call to drill in Alaskas Arctic Nati onal Wildlife Refuge are considered nonstarters in Congress where the plan is likely to be amended with more shortterm solutions to the California energ y squeeze But the bulk of the recommendations are in executive orders and regulatory changes which the administration can do with little resistance Bush plans to sign an order next week directing federal agencies to expedit e permits for new energy plants The presidents allies in Congress vowed swift action House Resources Committee Chairman James V Hansen RUtah said his panel would work quick ly to accommodate the plan by opening up protected areas for oil drilling and coal mining The thrust of the energy recommendations could be seen today in the init ial reactions satisfaction from industry consternation from conservationists Its balanced I think it has something for everybody and it addresse s the problems that should be addressed said Thomas E Capps chairman of Dominion Resources Inc the Richmond energy company that is Virginias largest electricity supplier California has an energy crisis now The res t of the country is going to have one unless something is done Industry representatives voiced few if any objections at a White House briefing an administration official took a lengthy pause when asked if any part of the report would disappoint industry Thats a good point he sai d noting tax credits that go to conservation rather than oil and gas Leading environmental groups held a joint news conference in Washington to denounce Bushs proposal which they said would spoil natural resources but do little to ease the shortterm energy shortage They unveiled a televisio n ad featuring a mock auctioneer selling the nations resources to the highes t bidder And they argued that Bushs plan by increasing reliance on fossil fuels would increase global warming emissions by percent over years Environmentalists were particularly miffed that the plan ties the few benefits conservationists sought to more controversial elements such as expanding drilling on public land In what is a truly cruel joke the Bush plan would also use oil revenues from the Arctic refuge to pay for land protection and renewable energy programs said William H Meadows preside nt of the Wilderness Society Thats like burning your furniture to heat your home Objections came from government watchdogs too The libertarian Cato Inst itute argued that the administration is simply positioning itself to take credit for what the market is already busily accomplishing Cato analyst Jerry Taylor said the nation is in a power plant construction boom with megawatts of new capacity to be available by and as much as megawatts by This will not only burst the electricity price bubble b ut will probably produce an electricity glut in the near future Taylor said He decried a smorgasbord of handouts and subsidies for virtually every energy lobby in Washington On Capitol Hill reactions to Bushs proposals fell predictably along pa rty lines House Speaker J Dennis Hastert RIll pledged to start hearings immediately on the plan which he praised as wellbalanced I believe it meets the goals most important to the American people by increasing our energy supplies providing price stability and protecting our precious environment he said in a statement House Minority Leader Richard A Gephardt DMo on the other hand he ld an elaborate news conference in the Capitol with other Democrats that featured a satellite connection to three San Diego residents facing rising energy prices We think the presidents plan makes the wrong choices for America and the American people Gephardt declared in front of projected images of a gas pump and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge It was crafted behind closed doors with a lot of input from energy executives and in a highly secretive way that doesnt serve the public interest Democrats say they view the issue as one of the GOPs top vulnerabilities in the months to com e Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss said he wants to begin heari ngs on one big energy policy bill next week House Energy and Commerce Committe e Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa whose panel will move much of the energyrelated legislation predicted his committee would take up conservation measures first and then move to the question of supply In the coming months Tauzin said Congress will take steps to allow consumers to sell power back to their local energy grids urge the auto industry to adop t stricter fuel efficiency standards and promote better transmission technologies Bush is the first president since Jimmy Carter in to ask Americans to think about their energy supply and the tones were as different as the times Carter proposed a windfall profits tax for oil companies and asked citizens to follow the speed limit drive fewer miles a week and carpool once a week Bush declared Conservation doesnt have to mean doing withou t Thanks to technology it can mean doing better and smarter and cheaper The plan leaves many issues to be hashed out For instance it directs E nergy Secretary Spencer Abraham to propose comprehensive electricity legislation that promotes competition while protecting consumers It directs Transportation Secretary Norman Y Mineta to consider higher fueleconomy standards for new vehicles but said they must increase efficiency without negatively impacting the US automotive industry Before Bushs speech he toured a power plant that

Bush drew applause from the crowd which had been selected by a local business group when he called on his critics to work with him Just as we need a new tone in Washington we also need a new tone in discussing energy and the environment one that is less suspicious less punitive less rancorous he said Weve yelled at each other enough Now its time to listen to each other and act Still Bush could

Californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast Its not out of the question say some lawmakers I actually think its a thoughtful plan to give folks an opportunity t o understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the Assemblys point man on energy Keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts The Independent System Operator keeper of the states power grid is expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work The idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer Keeley said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the stat e set a price limit on what theyll pay for power And if generators dont lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers Action Network says the states current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts need s to be revamped UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and f or a certain duration Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell the ir unused electricity to other states or trim back

Californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast Its not out of the question say some lawmakers I actually think its a thoughtful plan to give folks an opportunity t o understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the Assemblys point man on energy Keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts The Independent System Operator keeper of the states power grid is expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work The idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer Keeley said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the stat e set a price limit on what theyll pay for power And if generators dont lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers Action Network says the states current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts need s to be revamped UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and f or a certain duration Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell the ir unused electricity to other states or trim back

business group urged Gov Gray Davis yesterday to take emergency steps in the energy crisis including seizing power plants an action the governor said may be in the cards Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego Building Owners and Managers Association overseers of about commercial properties here The meeting at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown was closed to the media In remarks to reporters later Davis repeated his hard line against outofstate energy producers relating a threat made to a dozen power executives in a private meeting May I told the generators face to face as close as I am to you Gentlemen you are going to lose your plants and Im going to sign a windfallprofits tax unless you help us get through this summer without blackouts and without staggering prices Davis also said he told them You know youve been ripping us off acting in a predatory manner If you do it this summer you leave me no choice but to take your plants and sign a windfallprofits tax So the ball is in your court gentlemen Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had a frank exchange with Davis We want to do our fair share on conservation but were also concerned about the supply side he said The group strongly urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary includin g seizing plants Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of conservation measures Yet some cannot be implemented without state intervention she said For example Davis urged that airconditioning thermostats be

Texas firms By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy companies shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home state of President Bush We are literally in a war with energy companies who are pricegouging us Davis told reporters while responding to Bushs energy plan this week Man y of those companies are in Texas The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy companies in the Southwest Anyone could have purchased the California power plants Davis said but t he people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest However a state Energy Commission report shows that when California utilities sold more than power plants capable of producing megawatts Texas firms purchased plants producing about megawatts Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on itself So if Texas can have some kind of price relief Davis said I think California is entitled to price relief But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from offering to sell power for more than per megawatthour far above the average that California expects to pay for noncontracted power th is spring The campaign operation for Davis who is up for reelection next year and h as been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in distributed a news release yesterday saying that Davis is emerging as a national spokesman fo r the Democrats on energy issues The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic presidential candidate Al Gores campaign Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane a s interim communication consultants He named Gores former deputy chief of staff Nancy McFadden as senior adviser The governor will give the Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio addre ss today While Davis blames the Lone Star State none of Pacific Gas and Electrics power plants which produce megawatts was sold to Texas firms They were sold to Duke of North Carolina Mirant of Georgia and Calpine of California The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES Corp of Virginia which obtained megawatts Reliant a Texas firm bought plants from Edison that can produce megawatts Destec of Houston and NRG Energy of Minneapolis purchased two Edison plants with an output of megawatts Dynegy of Houston and NRG Energy purchas ed plants producing megawatts from San Diego Gas and Electric Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic transfer of wealth from California to Houston A large electricity marketin g firm with close ties to Bush Enron also is based in Houston But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant whose profits soare d last year Reliant openly rejected Davis call last week for generators to accept a percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California utilities Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to provide emergency power to California Davis began singling out Reliant aft er it charged the state per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by the California grid Reliants president Joe Bob Perkins said in a teleconference with California reporters yesterday that Reliant charged the high price because it did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limit ed number of days The state of California which has spent about billion buying power for utility customers since January made emergency purchases of megawatt hours from Reliant on May and paying per megawatt hour for a total of In Texas the Public Utilities Commission adopted a per megawatt hou r cap on bids to supply emergency power as a circuitbreaker in case prices somehow skyrocketed after Texas deregulates next year I realize that amount has been reached in California said Terry Hadley a spokesman for the Texas PUC Nothing close to that has been reached in Texas Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator wa s per megawatt hour in He said the average price is to per megawatt hour Texas has a surplus of power unlike California which has to import about percent of its power Texas also has a selfcontained power grid that cover s about percent of the state including Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin California is part of a sprawling Western power grid Davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the West The Texas PUC rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a failsafe saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power plants are needed The governor yesterday

manipulation ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES The head of the California Public Utilities Commission pro vided a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduc ed electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices While testifying before the committee Friday PUC President Loretta Lynch displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last November According to the graphs after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates We certainly see a pattern Lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers Many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent California Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production Lynch said She would not identify the power plants involved however Lynch did say th at they are owned by at least two companies Sen Joseph Dunn who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said Lynchs testimony on its face is very damning He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior During a break in Fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of majo r power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits There has been no collusion said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy Producers Association The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin California economy braces for billion electric rate hike By Michael Liedtke ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO Higher power costs zapped restauranteur Marino Sandoval and his customers even before California regulators decided this week how to allocate a billion electricity rate hike the highest in the state s history Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill Sandova l last month raised the prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain El Balazo by as much as percent on some items A giant burrito that cost at the end of March costs Saturday We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything from our beans to our tortillas was going up almost every day Our higher prices ha ve everything to do with the higher energy prices said Sandoval who runs si x restaurants in San Francisco and the East Bay From hotels to bagel shops businesses throughout California have been raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power costs Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the states power crisis Now businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the states two bigges t utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The higher rates which will begin appearing in Junes utility bills threaten to jolt the states already jittery economy Pretty soon we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession said Dave Puglia a vice president for APCO a public affairs firm hired by California business interests to study the economic effect of the states energy woes Until now California businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the states staggering electricity bill which is on a pace to reach billio n this year about times more than in By itself the billion rate increase approved by the California Public Utilities Commission probably isnt enough to topple the states roughly trillion economy the sixth largest in the world It will cause some hardships particularly for some small business owners but from the macro point of view these rate increases arent going to have a major impact on Californias output predicted Sung Won Sohn chief economist for Wells Fargo Co which runs the biggest bank headquartered in the state But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline natural gas health care benefits and workers compensation insurance Against this backdrop many employers also face pressure to raise their workers wages to help pay for Californias high housing costs If this keeps up at some point we are going to reach a breaking point in the economy said Allan Zaremberg president of the California Chamber of Commerce The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and Economic Stability a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricit y rate increase from businesses to households Under the plan approved by the PUC businesses are expected to pay about billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional billion Even if they are spared on their utility bills consumers still will be pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along their electricity price increases Some California firms particularly those making commodities sold around th e world wont be able to substantially raise their prices without losing business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and countries Manufacturers of cement glass paper products and steel are among the companies that probably wont be able to pass along their higher energy costs Puglia said The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about percent to percent of a big manufacturers budget Puglia estimated up from about percent now I wouldnt be surprised if we see some companies go out of business becaus e of this said Justin Bradley director of energy programs for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Association a hightech trade group Even if they dont shut down completely many companies likely will lay off workers as they cut costs to pay for power The California Manufacturers an d Technology Association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the loss of jobs or about more than the entire dotcom indu stry has laid off nationwide during the past months Painful though they may be higher electricity rates and some resulting layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts tha t probably would have occurred if retail prices hadnt been raised according to most economists People are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the Californ ia economy said Stephen Levy director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy a Palo Alto research firm The rate increases are part of a longterm solution for California We needed them to stabilize th e market On balance this is a good thing Even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from last year to this year El Balazos Sandoval shares Levys optimism After all customers continue to pour into his restaurants despi te his restaurants higher menu prices Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am going to have to raise my prices again he said If I have to I will I dont think people are going to stop eating because of this Price information sought from natural gas companies By H Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS May WASHINGTON A federal regulatory agency late Friday directed natural ga s companies selling in California to provide detailed information for better investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it viewed the unusually high prices of wholesale natural gas in California as a matter of serious concern but didnt have enough information to determine if they are illega l It noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the California borde r has been exceedingly high since December when it ranged between and per thousand cubic feet compared to to elsewhere in the count y The most recent prices at the California border exceed more than twice the wholesale price in other parts of the country Such a disparity over su ch a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market the agency said California officials have argued for months that FERC should intervene and more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices which have been a major cause of some of the runup in electricity costs in the state Many o f the states power plants run on natural gas The order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar quarter including volumes of gas sold prices transportation rates daily operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state Allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the cente r of a hearing by a FERC administrative law judge all this week The hearing will continue next week The case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the Houstonbased E l Paso Corp which supplies Southern California California regulators and two of the states financially troubled utilities filed a formal complaint with FERC alleging that manipulation by two El Pa so subsidiaries one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipel ine led to billion in natural gas overcharges since March El Paso Corp has strongly denied the allegation For the past week attorneys for El Paso have questioned witnesses from the California Public Utilities Commission in an attempt to disprove the charge s The witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that could have affected prices in their analyses but they did not back away fr om their conclusion In support of their argument California officials have provided internal E l Paso memos which have not been disclosed publicly that allegedly discuss market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner has said the documents contain statements that could lead one to believe there was an abuse of pipeline capacity He is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this summer A final decision on what action to take if any would be up to the full commission Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan Power He also hires highprofile consultants in effort to boost his political standing By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z BARABAK Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic Partys point man against President Bushs energy plan even as he seeks to bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed their crisismanagement skills during the scandalridden Clinton administration Davis was expected to again criticize Bushs energy plan today as he makes the official Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio address In the last week Davis has variously blasted the presidents energy plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show on CNN and in an opinion piece for the Washington Post In an interview with Associated Pres s Davis vowed to hold everyone accountable myself the energy producers and the president of the United States We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging us Davis said Friday Many of those companies are in Texas Mr Presiden t you didnt create this problem but you are the only one who can solve it At the same time Davis all but acknowledged his own political problem s when he announced that he has retained two political aides Mark Fabiani an d Chris Lehane The two who also do work for Southern California Edison wil l be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of per monthmore than the earned by the governor himself Lehane known for his tarttongued commentary was Vice President Al Gores main campaign spokesman and had a knack for getting under Bushs sk in during the campaign Fabiani a Harvard law school graduate became a highly partisan and acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky affair Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the e nd of the late mayors tenure In political circles the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaste r Davis decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governors oncesterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent criticism over his handling of the energy crisis Their arrival also corresponds to Davis increasingly aggressive stand on the energy crisis In recent days Davis for the first time has attacked an individual generator Reliant Energy of Houston for charging a record per megawatt for electricity on two days last week He also dared President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to stand up to their friends in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices charged in California Davis more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up the ir attacks on the president using the energy plan to launch a broader assault on Bushs leadership and policies One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no shortterm relief for consumers said Dan Pfeiffer a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Assn which Davis chairs And there is no better example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in California In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of Californiat he nations largest electoral prizeDemocrats see Bushs energy response as a way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interes ts This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration an d a party that is bought and paid for by special interests said Jenny Backu s a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee To press the case the party has created a snide Web sitewwwgrandoldpetroleumand will soon start running TV ads attacking G OP lawmakers over the energy issue including in California Paul Maslin the governors pollster said Davis had given the preside nt a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would addres s the energy problem But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it became clear we werent going to get any help from Washington For his part Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania part of his tour to sell t he administrations energy blueprint The president praised Californians for doing a fantastic job in conservation And yet theyre lacking energy Theyre having blackouts Bush said We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great sta te of California But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence While Bush did not mention the governor the presidents deputies have rushed to criticize him Virginia Gov James Gilmore head of the Republican National Committee suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when the president is the one who came forward with the first energy plan weve seen in years Hes going to have to answer the question of what hes done as governor Gilmore said While hes in the process of attacking one might suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record On Thursday Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party official Darrell Kearney Hes had plenty of time to do something and he hasnt done anything she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada Iowa where Bush had just finished speaking Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush plan namely the focus on longterm solutions at a time voters are growing increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills While the administration talks about how we approach things in the next five years theres not a lot of empathy or understanding for whats affecting people now said Stuart Rothenberg a nonpartisan political analyst in Washington Maybe its unfair to talk about Bush and Cheneys oil backgrounds and Texas backgrounds Rothenberg said But its an obvious thing for critics to do Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of Congress next year if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans really become concerned It puts the burden on the White House and Republicans to change that Davis new aides while considered expert in solving the kind of political crisis threatening Davis pose the potential of controversy on their own As consultants Lehane and Fabiani unlike government officials are n ot required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings a nd sources of income However in an interview on Friday Lehane acknowledged that he and Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern California Edison He insisted there is no conflict Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck wi th Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy Several lawmakers oppose the deal contending that it is too rich for Edison Both sides Edison and Davis are in agreement on what needs to be do ne here Lehane said As the governor said we are literally in a war with these outofstate generators Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications issues for Davis Harry Snyder of Consumers Union a critic of the DavisEdison deal blasted Davis decision to hire consultants who also wor k for the utility Davis has done everything politically wrong Snyder said He hasnt done anything that is consistent with the democratic process It is the wor st abuse of power that I have seen in years of lobbying Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo aboard Mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of communication strategy Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick said He has tremendous experience He takes the incoming You get hit wit h something in the morning He knows how to turn it around by the afternoon Lehane said the governors decision to hire them does not suggest Davi s will become more pugnacious although he added that Davis is not someone afraid to pick a fight when someone like the outofstate generators represent policies that are bad for the people of California Gov Davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time i n this state

By ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity

from the states grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alert s Lynchs testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that sta te investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down unnecessarily to create artificial shortages often when the state was mo st desperate for electricity During her testimony Friday Lynch went beyond her assertions about unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly throttling back generation The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating th e exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to manipulate wholesale electricity prices including

the company said in a statement Friday But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than plants by PUC investigators since December show that generators are not always producing all the power they can It

Los Angeles Times Utility Exec Rejects the Governors Criticism Power Leader of Reliant Energy defends policies and says Davis rhetoric could harm California By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOThe top executive of a Houstonbased energy company single d out for criticism this week by Gov Gray Davis defended his company Friday and warned that the governors rhetoric will ultimately hurt California On Wednesday we were called obstructionist said Joe Bob Perkins chief executive of Reliant Energy which bought five Southern California power plants when the state launched deregulation in I dont think its obstructionist to supply record amounts of power from old plants in order to keep the lights on Perkins said I dont thi nk its obstructionist to invest more than million in alone to upgrad e the plants and reduce emission levels I dont think its obstructionist to continue to run our facilities at times when theres been no guarantee of payment In a telephone conference call with reporters Perkins said Californ ia officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the impacts of summer blackouts Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures coul d scare off substantial business from California For months Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in California as gougers and profiteers but until last week he did not single out individual companies Last Thursday after state power buyers paid an extraordinary p er megawatthour Davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state power purchases and named Reliant as the seller Reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the sta te and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the million it is owe d by California utilities Theyre one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said after the Reliant executives remarks The governors recent attack has made some Reliant officials wonder if he is building a case to seize control of its power plants Davis has threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs Perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the state from buying the power which was produced at a small inefficient pla nt near Santa Barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of ai r pollution regulations Reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later this summer Maviglio said Reliants argument defies logic When you make a bid you want somebody to buy the power Copyright Los Angeles Times PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion Power She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create artificial shortages An industry spokesman calls the accusation idiocy By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ Times Staff Writers State investigators have uncovered evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency working with the state attorney generals office is probing patterns of plant outages that have created artificial shortages particularly when the state has issued emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said in an interview at The Times And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce even when they were obligated to do so unde r special contracts with the state and utility companies Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough information for the PUC and attorney generals office to take legal action against the generators next month The exact nature of that action she sai d is still under review Lynch who is an attorney did not name specific suppliers or provide documentation of her assertions She said that information will remain confidential until court proceedings are undertaken Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark et in any unlawful way including orchestrating plant shutdowns They say the facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha t breakdowns are a recurring problem Lynch and Gov Gray Davis who has been particularly critical of outofstate generators have not suggested that every plant shutdown has been unwarranted In fact the governors top advisor on power plants released a stateme nt last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was justified and that the companys officials were accommodating State Atty Gen Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi nt investigation with the PUC A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyers office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wideranging probe of possible civil and criminal violations So far the attorney generals office has subpoenaed documents in categories from generators including records of plant operations pricing practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another about Californias power market Were looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair business practice laws Lockyer has told The Times Although he has not provided details of his offices findings he recently said the inquiry is beginning to get interesting Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass ed during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous subpoenaed records obtained after intense legal battles with the power companies In addition investigators have been entering plants where unplanned shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records Lync h said At times the investigators have been denied access and have had to exert legal pressure to get in she said The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices whic h have gone from a megawatthour in December to as high as last week I would argue its no accident Lynch said of the high prices That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the rules of Californias flawed deregulation program which allowed them to bu y power plants formerly run by the states three largest utilities Gary Ackerman a spokesman for a trade association of large power producers said Lynchs allegations were the height of idiocy The reason many plants have been down in recent months he said is th at power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe r demand He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman executive director of the Weste rn Power Trading Forum State analysts have argued however that power traders can reap extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power that is sold are so high According to Lynch investigators have found that some companies were more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat e the states power market She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern When operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage alertmeaning th at electricity reserves have dropped below plants that do not need repairs suddenly are yanked offline That she said aggravates the shortages and the cost of wholesale electricity soars Before December state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up prices primarily through

endured historically high levels of unplanned plant outages The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by utility companies because they have not been going off line at record levels Lynch said The California Energy Commission reported last week that the states electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several times higher than in the last two years A Times analysis of state data found that throughout the last two months about megawatts of production was offline more than a third of the peak power used in California on a typical day That has been about evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns By contrast shutdowns in the same period of and took only to megawatts offline Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electrici ty supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise prices The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any wrongdoing However FERC released a study in February of closures at three other California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcit y of

this story Copyright Los Angeles Times Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark Effect Presidents energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the powerdeprived Golden State By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS Times Staff Writers California lawmakers analysts and others waistdeep in the states power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House energy plan By the time many of President Bushs proposals kick in it will be too late to do the Golden State much good This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the next critical months groused state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey You cant focus just on the long term here Because the patient will be de ad before we get the lifesupport systems in place Gov Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are draining Californias treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases Instead the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil increased reliance on nuclea r power and more than billion in tax credits for conservation and energy development Most of Bushs proposals however are slowacting remedies and many others already are being applied in California which was hit by energy woe s far ahead of other states The plans dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices experts say Overall the message in this plan is Drop dead California said Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased research and advocacy group I dont think it delivers another megawatt to California added Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the power crisis as an ongoing emergency rather than a temporary one Californias supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer once new power plants of them licensed in the pipelinestart churning Its not that we dont have longterm problems said Stephen Levy director of the Palo Altobased Center for Continuing Study of the Californ ia Economy Its just that energy isnt among them Others including many environmentalists say Bush could have made a noticeable impact by for example beefing up energy efficiency programsa quick clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand Why not provide aggressive incentives rebates to get people to purchase more efficient air conditioners asked Dan Reicher assistant Energy secretary in the Clinton administration Over the course of the yea r a program like that can make a dramatic difference because air conditionin g consumes nearly onethird of Californias peak energy supply Instead Reicher noted Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency standards for air conditioners a move that critics say will require the country to build new power plants Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California were clouded by doubt Bush for example directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to relieve a key transmission bottleneck known as Path between Northern and Southern California But he specified that the upgrade which requires building a mile line at an estimated cost of million be funded by nonfederal contributionsmeaning the financially strapped utilities migh t be expected to bear the cost Gov Davis who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from Washington said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an d criticized the president for allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of which reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said the state is doing everything possible to build and conser ve our way out of the problem but it desperately needs federal price control s on energy costs In California energy users spent about billion this year even with consumption down the bill could top billion But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney who led the task force that prepared the plan are opposed to price caps preferring to let market forc es reign Davis said that laissez faire approach puts Californias economy in peril Just saying over the long haul everything will work out is turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state Davis said Small businesses literally will go out of business because the y cant afford these rates Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California Bush recommends building power plants over the next yearsabout eight plants a month But California is already on a plantbuilding spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year s The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi ng for a renewed commitment to nuclear power The California governor however has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive order issued in February There is little evidence meanwhile that Californians are eager to approve an expansion in nuclear power Nationwide not one new nuclear plan t has been licensed in more than years And a Times Poll in February found that of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state You can barely build cleanburning gas plants here let alone nuclear plants said Edward Kahn a San Franciscobased energy consultant with Analysis GroupEconomics Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines Currently the US governments power to forcibly acquire private property applies only to highways and gas pipelines Expanding that power is likely to enrage property owners and propertyrights advocates who typically expect backing from Bushstyle conservatives Im just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the states authority over its own land said Lynch of the PUC The issue is already heated in California Communities in southwestern Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas Electrics attemp ts to use eminent domain to obtain private land for miles of transmission lines The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energ y officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for priva te acreage Bush also proposed a unified private national electricity grid an id ea that seems at odds with Southern

connected to state grid LA not among them say their customers should not be deprived to aid others By SCOTT GOLD Times Staff Writer A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the federal government today to exempt them from blackouts Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in California and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled outjust as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages Most Californians pay large investorowned utilities like Southern California Edison Co for power But about a quarter of households from th e tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital are billed for electricit y by cities counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit utilities There are municipal utilities Four of themserving Los Angeles Burbank Glendale and the Imperial Valley east of San Diegoare independent of the state power grid and do n ot face any outages But the others are required by contract to give electrici ty back to the California Independent System Operator which runs the grid by participating in rolling blackoutsalthough they have plenty of power to serve their customers It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs said California Municipal Utilities Assn attorney Tony Braun These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions behind the deregulation of Californias electricity market and the power shortage We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and that we dont have the rightnor does anyone elseto take it away from th em when they need it said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans Our customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t o Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts Vernons public utility has customers all but of which are industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants T he city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state said Jorge Somoano Vernons assistant director of resource management FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the campaign Up to half including Riverside are expected to either file thei r own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon said Washington attorne y Bonnie Blair who represents municipal utilities in Azusa Banning and Colt on Even the campaigns supporters are unsure whether it will succeed Bla ir acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal challenge to FERC which is expected to decide on the issue by midJune An d she said municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don e enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis Some cities with municipal utilities such as Anaheim are not plannin g to join the campaign Marcie Edwards general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities said the relationships between municipal utilities and CalISO are too complicated t o make a clean break She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed entirely on the large investorowned utilitiesincluding this summers energy crunch And until that can be proved she said municipal utilities still have an obligation to support Californias power grid Its not right to go either way she said The fact remains th at municipals still have an obligation to serve Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through agreements with CalISO that call for them to share electricity in an emergency Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for natural disasters such as earthquakes or other sudden and monumental problems such as a plane running into a transmission line The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient supplies Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC does not constitute an emergency The obligation to share in rolling blackouts did not contemplate situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to provide resources to serve their customers Blair said If they are force d to participate in rolling blackouts the effect is that the ISO is taking energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it Jim Detmers CalISOs vice president of operations said the organization plans to fight the campaign He said emergency provisions of CalISOs agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy crunch Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha ve their own electricity distribution He compared the exemption request to a homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbors because he wants to kee p his water for himself What were dealing with is an overall shortage Detmers said We wa nt to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyones lives are at risk Ronald Nunnally Edisons director of federal regulations and contract s said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the power grid to which they are connected The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole if you will under all circumstances he said Blair said those arguments dont hold up Indeed she said the municip al utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits giving public property such as electricity bought by a municipal utility to a private enterprise such as investorowned electric companies Our customers are paying for it she said Thats the bottom line A United Defense The big bad wolf of Californias electric power crisis is the private power generators accused of manipulating the market to drive wholesale pow er rates into the stratosphere out of pure greed Their pricing is insane but only the federal government can fix wholesale prices The Bush administrati on refuses to do that leaving the state virtually helpless to deal with what many are now calling an energy cartel Gradually however the state is arming itself in other ways to do battle with the big power bullies who appear more and more to have acted i n concert to affect prices Not as blatantly as the oil producers cartel OPEC but with even more dramatic results What is California considering A new state power agency could build and run its own plants Lawmakers might as they are threatening impose a windfall profits tax The state could join with other Pacific states in a buyers cartel th at would simply refuse to purchase power if the price got too high The idea seems a bit desperate but it has a Star Wars allure to it and just might work The focus is on six big private companies They produce only about onefourth of the states electricity but they are the ones that have powe r available when it is needed the most as the heat rises air conditioners g o on and blackouts are threatened The private and municipal utilities naturally use their own power first then turn to the outside generators to meet additional demand The state has forked over billion to keep the lights on since the biggest private utilities went broke The cost of power has hit an obscene peak of nearly a megawatthour charged by Reliant Energy of Houston during a recent hot spell This price more than times the going rate a year ago prompted a furious Gov Gray Davis to threaten to use his emergen cy powers to commandeer Reliants power or even seize one of its power plants No one is eager for the state to take over private power plants That smacks of dictatorship But if the generators can get away with charging so much during a brief hot spell in May what will the cost be in August The state is continues to investigate allegations that the six produce rs colluded to control the market or that they shut down plants to create a false shortage The state may take legal action next month However even that may not force prices down The buyers cartel has possibilities California would get Oregon and Washington to join in deciding the highest rate they are willing to pay for power this summer a price still providing the producers a generous profit If the generators wouldnt sell at that level the states would refuse to buy This would mean more blackouts for a time but the generators would be left with power they could not sell This extreme action would not be necessary of course if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted its responsibility under federal law and imposed a reasonable temporary cap on wholesale power prices That is n ot likely If the states are left to their own devices they can at least join forces Then for a change let the seller beware Search the archives of the Los Angeles Times for similar stories You will not be charged to look for stories only to retrieve one Cheney blames Davis for crisis They knew over a year ago they had a problem Zachary Coile Chronicle Political Writer Monday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Vice President Dick Cheney in his most blunt and partisan assessment yet of Californias energy crisis faulted Democratic Gov Gray Davis for failing to act quickly enough and called the states purchase of nearly billion worth of energy a harebrained scheme Cheney the administrations point man on energy issues went on a pair of Sunday morning news shows to help sell a national energy plan that Presiden t Bush proposed last week The discussion inevitably turned to California Theyve bankrupted the biggest utility in the state destroyed the states credit rating and squandered a significant portion of the states financial surplus in a harebrained scheme to try to use the state to purchase power the vice president told Tim Russert of NBCs Meet the Press A spokesman for Davis responded that the vice presidents remarks yesterday were grossly misinformed and meant to divert attention from the administrations neglect of the state and its power woes The Bush administration has refused to address Californias problem and n ow theyre washing their hands of it Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said The titfortat remarks culminated a week that has seen an escalation in th e war of words between the Democratic governor and the Republican White House The two administrations are increasingly engaging in a blame game as they confront a worsening crisis with enormous political stakes for both sides Responding to critics including Davis who say the White House has don e little to help California the vice president pointed the finger back at th e states top Democratic official They knew over a year ago they had a problem and Gray Davis refused to address that problem Cheney said They kept putting it off and putting it off and putting it off with the notion that somehow price caps could be maintained Now today where are they in California Well rates are having to go up The PUC just had to increase the rates themselves in California Theyve go t rolling blackouts theyve had some already Theyll have them across the state this summer Cheney said Cheneys remarks referred to the states purchases of almost billion wor th of energy which began after the major utilities could no longer afford skyrocketing wholesale prices for energy Earlier this month the Democratcontrolled California Legislature approved a bill opposed by GOP lawmakers to issue billion in bonds to repay th e states general fund to avoid making deep cuts in other state programs KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON Thats the governor keeping the lights on Maviglio said Because of the failure of the federal government to act to impose price controls the state had to move to keep the lights on Cheneys comments came just days after Davis sharply criticized Bushs ener gy plan saying it wouldnt help California consumers facing rising energy bills Mr President you didnt create this problem but you are the only one wh o can solve it Davis said in a letter released to the press With all due respect Californians want to know Mr President whether youre going to be on their side Davis also suggested that by refusing to ask federal regulators for price caps Bush was effectively allowing pricegouging by oil and gas producers in his home state of Texas Cheney dismissed the allegation last week as goofy CALIFORNIA A BAD EXAMPLE In speeches on his energy plan the president has mostly used California as an example to the nation of what not to do He warned last week that the states blackouts were a preview of what other states could face if the country doesnt boost energy supplies Some California Republican leaders have warned Bush who will visit Souther n California later this month to soften the administrations rhetoric on the energy crisis to avoid being seen as unsympathetic to the states plight Cheney explained yesterday that the administration opposes even shortterm price controls because they could discourage energy suppliers from selling energy into California and building more plants in the state In the final analysis its going to be the private sectors response that generates the power were going to need longterm Cheney said The vice president did offer an olive branch to Davis noting that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers approved the states deregulation legislation precipitating the states energy problems In fairness to Governor Davis the screwy regulatory scheme they put in place was supported on both sides of the aisle out there Cheney said Bu t he was the one who was in charge when it went haywire Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif who followed Cheney on CBS Face the Nation yesterday morning put the blame back on the White House She recalled that President John F Kennedy called steel company executives into his office when they were accused of price gouging She urged Bush and Cheney to do th e same with energy suppliers You have the vice president sitting there sounding like an oil man Boxe r said The energy companies are blameless here he says And the truth is that the

with walls that gently glow or your plain glass windows with electronic ones that darken at the press of a button Some day such geewhiz technologies might save California and the nation plenty of energy besides bringing for better or worse the aesthetic taste of the Jetsons into tomorrows homes In the meantime researchers are designing less futuristic energysaving gadgets that might be ready in time to help ease the energy problems California is facing now Among the technologies under development unusual ceiling lamps being teste d in a Bay Area post office miniature fluorescent lights that offer better luminescence than their drab lowglow ancestors luminous flexible plasti c tubes that emit neat little beams of light and indoor versions of the brilliant sulfur lamps that presently illuminate giant parking lots at nigh t If the history of the past three decades is any guide energysaving technologies arent just wacky schemes like the flying cars and atomicpowered blimps ballyhooed in s editions of Popular Science and like magazines Rather energysaving technologies are already an unheralded hero of late th century technology having saved the nation the energy equivalent of numerous nuclear power plants since the last Were running out of energy freakouts of the s The next time your smug friends and relatives back east mock California as an energy hog you can inform them that in fact we only use half as much electricity per capita as the rest of the United States A major reason prescient energyconservation rules developed under thenGov Jerry Brown t wo decades ago according to veteran energyconservation scientist Art Rosenfeld Widely ridiculed as Governor Moonbeam Brown and the California Energy Commission thought it was wiser to develop tough energyconservation standards for buildings and appliances than to build new nuclear power plan ts and it turns out it was says Rosenfeld a current member of the Energ y Commission and former czar of energy conservation science at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which is funded mainly by the US Energy Department Undaunted by the changing political winds of the past three decades scientists at the lab have continued designing energyconserving technologies even though at first glance the new technologies dont look that exciting NEW LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES Witness for example the lamps being tested at the post office in Rodeo T he lamps are long thin tubes that aim light directly onto each carriers mailsorting station rather than wastefully spreading it all over the plac e Its a simple innovation yet it reduces energy costs for lighting by up to percent Lawrence Berkeley researchers have calculated Likewise they have recently invented a new type of highperformance energyefficient table lamp that could greatly reduce the current power problems we have in California while increasing the quality of the lighting says researcher Michael Siminovitch of the Berkeley lab The lamp consists of compact fluorescent lights that can be manipulated to direct light in different directions toward the ceiling for example Th at allows the users to finetune lighting conditions to their precise needs overcoming common complaints about the dimness and poor design of first generation powersaving lights The new lamps use only onefourth as much energy as a watt incandescent table lamp or a watt halogen lamp Unveiled in March they are being field tested by the lab in collaboration with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric LIGHTEMITTING DIODES Looking farther into the future the oldfashioned incandescent light bulb may be challenged by electronic LEDs or lightemitting diodes commonly us ed for VCRs and alarm clocks Those dim little lights may eventually be made bright enough and white enough to begin replacing traditional lighting sources One problem the refraction or bending of light Everyone has seen what happens when one inserts a straw into a glass of water the submerged portion of the straw appears to bend In the semiconductor materials used i n LEDs much of the internally generated light is bent so much that it reflec ts back into the LED that is it cant escape Hence present LEDs dont em it enough light to attract a large commercial market However engineers at Lawrence Berkeley and elsewhere are designing new LED s that would emit far more light One of them is physicist Steve Johnson who is confident that LEDs can eventually be made brighter than ordinary light bulbs He points out that colored LEDs are already used in some traffic lights By mixing together LEDs that emit different wavelengths of light one could create a white lightemitting LED Johnson says White light is a mixture of all other optical wavelengths Johnson maintains LEDs could make a difference to the energy bill Onethird of our energy used in commercial buildings goes into lighting those buildings So anything we do to reduce the lighting bill is going to help the energy crisis SUPEREFFICIENT APPLIANCES All sorts of strategies are being tried in labs all over the country Forget to turn off the iron before you drove out of town Appliances that c an be switched off remotely via computer modem are being developed by the Media Lab at MIT as part of its Kitchen Sync project The same project is figuring out how to create electronically interconnecte d homes in which the appliances will switch themselves on to perform nonessential work say washing the clothes only when theres no risk of a circuit overload Superefficient refrigerators that use magnetic refrigerants are being tested at Ames Laboratory a federally financed lab in Ames Iowa Scientists there are using magnetic cooling methods to replace the compressed gases deployed by typical refrigerators Physicists have long known that some materials get hotter when magnetized and cool off when demagnetized Even todays refrigerators consume energy far more efficiently than they on ce did Federal energy standards for refrigerators that took effect in July require that they burn only onefourth as much energy as did their predecessors years ago Rosenfeld notes Even better he adds modern refrigerators are bigger and dont use chlorofluorocarbons chemical compounds that are believed to damage the ozo ne layer which shields the Earth from cancercausing ultraviolet radiation Its all just a matter of designing them properly Rosenfeld says Email Keay Davidson at SAN FRANCISCO PGE cable failure hits Pier businesses

Janine DeFao Chronicle Staff Writer Monday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Oakland Already seeing red over rising utility bills Oakland residents have found themselves mired in red tape when they have sought energy alternatives such as solar power It can take up to eight weeks and cost more than to get the required city permits to install solar panels But the City Council is expected to change that tomorrow when it considers an emergency ordinance proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown to eliminate design review requirements for renewable energy installations including solar pane ls and wind devices Energy is an issue on everybodys plate these days We want to make it easy for people to get their permits and get their panels said Gary Patto n the citys deputy planning director Oakland officials said they know of no other city taking similar steps to promote alternative energy generation although cities throughout the Bay Area and the state are increasingly looking to renewable energy sources San Francisco for instance is considering placing solar energy bonds on t he November ballot that would fund installation of solar panels on municipal property and could provide lowcost loans for homeowners and businesses to do the same Berkeley also is working on a loan program for renewable energy sources for residences The Oakland measure which would remain in effect for two years also would apply to businesses interested in pursuing alternative energy generation As Californians already hit by the states energy crunch face the prospect of more rolling blackouts this summer Oakland city officials are receiving a growing number of inquiries from residents interested in installing solar panels Patton said The city also has heard complaints about the cost and time it now takes to get systems approved Gary Gerber president of Sun Light Power in Berkeley said he complained when he learned that it would cost more than to install a solar syst em on a home in the Montclair area The project is on hold awaiting the new ordinance The process didnt really fit our situation Its pretty cumbersome and is the same type of process you might go through for a major remodel Gerber said City officials responded beautifully in drafting a solarfriendly polic y he added Calvin Wong director of building services said the city has received a dozen applications for solar panel installations in the last month up fr om only a few applications before the energy crisis hit We anticipate a lot more he said Gerber said he gets five to calls a day from interested customers He ha s done as much business in the first three months of this year as he did all of last year he said I dont think solar panels have been a significant issue for Oakland up to now said Councilman Dick Spees who backs the proposed change We want t o encourage it by making it simple direct and less costly Oakland also is exploring installing solar panels on city buildings A household solar unit which can heat water or produce electricity directly can cost to although state rebates can reduce the price by half President Bushs energy plan released last week propos es a percent tax credit for residents who install solar panels Patton said the main target of Oaklands emergency ordinance was solar panels but it would apply to other renewable energy production facilities including those using wind and water Currently design review for such installations can cost between and and take between three and eight weeks depending on a propertys location Under the proposal design review would be waived once an owner submits drawings to the city showing that the equipment installation meets certain requirements such as matching the pitch of a sloped roof or if freestanding being no taller than feet For certain structures such as designated landmark sites design review still would be required but at no cost and lasting no more than five days Building permits and inspections costing between and still would be required to make sure the additions are safe Patton said Brown has long been considered an alternative energy

multiple probes Greg Lucas Sacramento Bureau Chief Sunday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Sacramento Up the road in Folsom at the nondescript headquarters of the Independent System Operator monitorinchief of Californias energy grid they have a new job responding to more than detailed subpoenas The data the ISO keeps on electricity transactions are central to the half dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various parts of the states energy mess including possible criminal activity by power generators Theyre asking for everything and then some a spokeswoman for the ISO Stephanie McCorkle said sighing The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Public Utilities Commission the Assembly the Senate the state attorney general and a phalanx of state and federal auditors all are boring into Californias ener gy mess The main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the electronstarved state Although most investigators say the ISOs logs and bid records show the various generators used their market share to drive up prices the issue is whether they did so acting collaboratively either directly or indirectly Generators deny any manipulation of the market They say their prices simpl y reflect a lack of supply plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas But that hasnt stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong Attorney General Bill Lockyer has been probing the actions of the generator s since August to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair business practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior We all feel weve been taken advantage of been gouged Lockyer said Th e question is whether its legal greed or illegal greed Theres no question its greed Lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like Reliant Energy Inc and Dynegy which have refused to disclose internal company information that Lockyer subpoenaed Feb The power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents Lockyer wants will be kept confidential Lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this summer The PUC also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices On Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said investigators found patterns of plant shutdowns that created artificial shortages Lockyer insisted that no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or criminal suit But were probably further along than any other investigativ e effort Generators say they are cooperating with the investigations except for worries about proprietary information becoming public and flatly reject the notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert We naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations sai d Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston It doesnt compute because we all compete against each other We dont cooperate shar e information or anything of that nature Its not only illegal but unethical to do so Said Chuck Griffin a

Corp manipulated the market Email Greg Lucas at Davis slams Bushs energy policy He says president should ensure reasonable prices Tyche Hendricks Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Gov Gray Davis blasted President Bushs energy strategy yesterday saying it will fail to rein in galloping energy prices and insinuating that Bushs close ties to the oil industry are behind his unwillingness to regulate prices Davis in delivering the Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio address called on Bush to place a cap on wholesale energy prices which he said a re imperiling Californias economy I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal governments exclusive responsibility to ensure energy prices a re reasonable said Davis California consumer advocates and utility officials alike endorsed the call for rate caps Bush has rejected such caps although in his radio address yesterday he noted that the average family energy bill has climbed by percent over th e past three years Thats a hardship for every family he said We need to act to protect family budgets His prescription however was not for restricting how much energy producer s can charge but for increasing energy production by building more power plants and drilling for oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Yesterday Bush put into action by executive order two of his recommendations including ordering federal agencies to speed permit approvals for new plant and pipeline construction Still other proposals such as tax credits for hybrid vehicle purchases will require congressiona l action Its time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new consensus Bush said in the radio address With new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment Last spring Davis said California was paying an average of for a megawatt of power By last week the price had spiked to nearly per megawatt Whats going on here pure and simple is unconscionable pricegouging by the big energy producers most of them incidentally located in Texas he said Davis criticized Bushs argument that limiting energy prices will deter producers from increasing the supply of energy Thats as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies a gallon to motivate them to produce milk he said Pacific Gas and Electric Co officials said they are pleased with Bushs emphasis on increasing electricity and natural gas generation and his call for improving energy efficiency But a prepared statement by PGE went on We continue to believe that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must stabilize the Western market thi s summer through circuit breakers price caps or costbased rates Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco based consumer advocacy group said Davis must realize Bush is not going to implement price caps In the absence of federal action the governor needs to take action himself said Spatt He could take plants by the power of eminent domain impose an excessprofits tax on energy producers or start a buyers carte l where Western states get together and refuse to pay over a certain price fo r electricity Davis should take his own advice to the president and stand up to these energy companies The state has spent billion already Hes got to put a stop to it or theyll bleed us of every penny we have House Democrats meanwhile said yesterday that they intend to begin airing television advertising in California beginning tomorrow that accuses Bush a nd Republican lawmakers of failing to combat the rising cost of energy It is unusual for a campaign committee such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to air political advertising more than months before elections But the move was clearly intended to exploit consumer anger over rising prices and rolling blackouts Chronicle news services contributed to this report Email Tyche Hendrick s at Power juggling ramped up price Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission sai d last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages th e states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only wer e generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for t he ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit outpu t he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy In c say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down an d electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men w ho only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism t o game the California energy market They and other power companies includin g AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the gr id managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair busines s practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certa in amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after thei r output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electrici ty rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that i f the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price woul d go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output they d say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels whi ch also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list o f plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage los t among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted f or more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capaci ty from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta AES Corp of Arlington Va and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough powe r for million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clearcut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previousl y reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations A nd an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant coowned by NRG and Dyne gy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of t he major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to b e shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was The operator said Its our unit shut it off the source said Email Christian Berthelsen at and Scott Winoku r at Grid officials others studying planned blackouts Posted at am PDT Monday May BY JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast Its not out of the question say some lawmakers I actually think its a thoughtful plan to give folks an opportunity to understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the Assemblys point man on energy Keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts The Independent System Operator keeper of the states power grid is expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work The idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer Keeley said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the stat e set a price limit on what theyll pay for power And if generators dont lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers Action Network says the states current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and f or a certain duration Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said I think w e would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell the ir unused electricity to other states or trim back production to keep supplie s short Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said I f businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the states power use and drive down prices Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices Bowen said California power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cashstrapped privately owned utilities Gov Gray Davis said the state paid per megawatt hour at one point last week The state has dedicated billion since midJanuary to purchase power fo r Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues billion in revenue bonds The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over years Planning ahead for blackouts Business services plan for summer crises By LOIS EVEZICH Aliso Viejo News No sooner did Aliso Viejo become the newest city in Orange County than California was hit with an energy crisis threatening rolling blackouts across the community Energy issues have already taken a priority with the councilelect and the city manager Weve had some meetings to familiarize ourselves with the situation said Interim City Manager William Woollett Weve hired an engineering firm to take a look at what kind of organization we need and what kind of budget we must have for this issue Woollett added that they havent done anything specific yet as Aliso Viejo is not a formal city until July Hilary McAllister head librarian at the Aliso Viejo branch of the Orange County Public Library said All the branches have a plan We plan to continue checking out books only doing the work by hand as long as it is safe Safety is the main issue and if that is a concern we might have to close Branches in the library system received instructions said McAllister and much of what they decide will have to do with how much warning time they have Were hoping the power company will warn us she said The library at Journey has been exempt from blackouts so far even when other areas in Aliso Viejo were hit McAllister isnt sure if that has anything to do with their location right across the street from the fire station Fluor Corporation with a large facility in Aliso Viejo which houses employees in its corporate headquarters and the fivebuilding campus a block away is well prepared for a blackout according to Lorie Serrato media representative We even have blackout kits for the elevators said Serrato They include bottled water snacks and flashlights She didnt know if there were also tranquilizers included for those who are claustrophobic Were getting used to taking the stairs she said And were learning to save our work on computers more often Thats important Barnes Noble experienced a blackout this winter For safety reasons customers were asked to gather at the front of the store and business went on though not as usual Customers who knew what books they wanted to buy asked employees to find them and sales were registered on calculators For safety reasons customers were not allowed where there was not adequate light Barnes Noble has cut lights in the back room to save energy and set the air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures Wendy Mortensen skating school director at the Ice Chalet at Journey said Weve been told that we are on the same power grid as the Sheriffs Substation and the Fire Department and that we wont lose power Mortensen said that in minutes not much would happen to the ice and if there is a blackout there is enough light during the day We are only running half the lights said Mortensen And we keep the offices and the hallways dark to conserve energy United Parcel Service is tightlipped about conservation measures They consider it proprietary information as the measures give them a competitive edge Overall the company said they can work during blackouts though it takes a little longer The facility does not have much activity during the peak energy hours but if it should happen during heavy work loads the facility can transfer the work to other shifts or to another UPS facility UPS in Aliso Viejo is part of the Edison Beat the Peak program designed to help companies conserve and prepare The facility has motion sensors in the offices and all employees have flashlights and other equipment as a safety precaution Kmart was awarded a million grant from the California Energy Commission in February It used some of that money to retrofit the Aliso Viejo store with energyconserving store lights that reduce consumption by percent The project is still under way with expected completion in the next severa l weeks Kmart also has uninterruptible power sources it uses as backups in case there is a blackout These backups provide minutes worth of energy used for the pharmacy and the cash registers In the event of a blackout t he store would close for new customers but could still service the customers already in the store Is price gouging root of crisis The president is allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of whom reside in Texas to get away with murder Gov Gray Davis said on Thursday in response to a George W Bush energy plan that doesnt call for caps on t he price of electricity sold by outofstate generators to California This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy problems Blame everybody else call for government price controls even though they historically have reduced the supply of energy and use divisiv e and even conspiratorial rhetoric On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan his appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission Loretta Lynch told a newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack up prices Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of wha t Ms Lynch called artificial shortages Were interested in seeing the evidence of course But it looks suspicious ly like politicians are using the powergouging theory as a way to bluster rather than come up with concrete solutions It also is a way for those who are ideologically hostile to deregulation perhaps cynical of business and capitalism in general to demonize merchant generators and pave the way fo r a government takeover No doubt wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed Prices zoomed from a megawatt hour late last year to nearly last week according t o the San Francisco Chronicle The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a cause of the price spike Yet a number of analysts have found the pricegouging theory to be dubious A Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dat a on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers Yes there were nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big producers in summer than in summer But as writer Mark Golden pointed out outages for all plants including municipally owned ones and small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system wer e percent higher in summer than in summer The writer notes tha t four of the Big are either constructing big new generators in California or have applied for permits to do so That would seem to fly in the face of a withholding strategy An April paper coauthored by William Hogan a professor at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University could not prove there wasnt manipulation but explained it is unlikely to be the dominant fact or and may not even be significant The bigger issue the Hogan paper argued is the seriously flawed restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse The principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Other analysts argue that to whatever degree pricegouging has taken place it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules that have distorted the market The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy th e power generators say but the result of needed maintenance on facilities th at have been overworked Many of these are older plants that require more shutdowns for maintenance than new ones People can invest money in various different markets Jan SmutnyJones to ld us he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers

be installed until this fall which means it will no t be available to help during this summers power crisis But officials belie ve it will be a valuable asset The CumminsWestport generator provides muchneeded electricity that meets environmental regulations and during peak periods can produce power for les s than the market cost of power general manager Marcie Edwards said The use of such onsite generators enables us to respond to customer needs while reducing Californias system demand The generator will provide offsite distributed generation that will be ab le to supplement Anaheims utility grid with power that may be called upon during state power emergencies or when the cost of wholesale market power i s high Anaheim gets percent of its energy supply from longterm power generati on contracts and percent on the daily wholesale market In addition the generator can provide about percent of the centers energy load and will serve as a source of backup emergency power Westport

requesting be set aside in the budget to purchase new emergency generators for the Civic Center Calif Utilities Make Accusation LOS ANGELES AP via NewsEdge Corporation There is evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase energy prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission said An energy official called the allegation idiocy PUC President Loretta Lynch told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that her agency and the state attorney generals office are probing plant outages that she said created artificial shortages that contributed to skyrocketing power prices There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce She said that happened even when plants were obligated to do so under special contracts with utility companies and the state Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum dismissed Lynchs allegations as the height of idiocy Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting within the rules of the states deregulation system The reason many plants have been down in recent months Ackerman said is that power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer demand My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman who represents a trade association of large power producers But Lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the PUC and attorney general to take legal action next month against some power generators She did not identify them and the exact nature of the legal action is still under review she said Investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed records obtained after legal battles with the power companies to gather evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns Lynch said Power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were visited to examine operations and maintenance records Lynch said Power prices have gone from a megawatt hour in December to as much as last week and plant shutdowns have been a key factor in the soaring prices I would argue its no accident Lynch said That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel Lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged When operators of the states electricity grid declared a Stage alert which means that electricity reserves had dipped below percent plants that didnt need repairs were suddenly pulled offline PGE Targets Business Customers for Energy Reduction Utility Steps Up Efforts to Encourage Conservation Awaits More State Funding SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREMay via NewsEdge Corporation In conjunction with its customer education campaign called The More You Know About Conserving Energy the Less Energy You Need Pacific Gas and Electric Company has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely The utility is also working with state officials to determine how best to use the additional funding for conservation and energy efficiency which is contained in SBx signed into law by Governor Davis on April The California Independent System Operator has forecast power shortages of to megawatts between now and the end of summer Shortages that significant may result in blackouts for millions of Californians With little new generation available in time for summer peak use along with a continuing reduction of hydroelectric power from the Pacific Northwest Californians must adopt rigorous energy conservation habits if outages are to be minimized The energy crisis has taken its toll on all of us with higher energy costs and blackouts but we recognize that our business customers are especially hurt because they use a lot of electricity and outages not only mean a loss of productivity but can damage expensive sensitive equipment said Bev Alexander Pacific Gas and Electric Company vice president over energy management programs Since businesses account for about half of customer electricity consumption their efforts to conserve have a great impact on statewide energy use So we want them to utilize all the tools available to reduce their energy use Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers advice and incentives to help consumers make their businesses more energy efficient Rebates are available for installing more efficient lighting HVAC refrigeration and other mechanical equipment The utility has budgeted million for business energy management programs in The funding comes from ratepayers via the Public Purpose Programs charge on all customers utility bills and is not impacted by the companys Chapter proceedings In addition Pacific Gas and Electric Company has proposed to the CPUC how it could spend approximately million to support businessrelated energy efficiency programs from SBx funds which set aside million in taxpayer dollars to encourage residential and nonresidential energy conservation The utility also is encouraging customers to take simple steps such as turning off lights and equipment and adjusting thermostats to reduce the air conditioning load On a hot summer day percent of Californias energy use is air conditioning and commercial lighting Alexander said For example if commercial office buildings turned out every other light and set their thermostats to degrees we could save roughly megawatts or the equivalent of seven large power plants Measures like these could virtually prevent blackouts this summer To educate business customers on the energy crisis and steps they can take the utility holds informational workshops throughout its service area sends newsletters includes bill inserts utilizes paid advertising the Internet and news stories Business customers can obtain information about energy efficiency programs by visiting wwwpgecom or calling the Business Customer Center at PGE The business outreach program is just one element of Pacific Gas and Electric Companys customer education campaign called

of Oregon Washington and Montana commands a huge amount of electricity enough to power Seattle daily Closing the smelters freed up a lot of power and significantly reduced Bonnevilles reliance on the electricity spot market But Bonneville now wants the smelters in the region to stay closed for t wo years business executives economists and union leaders are just now assessing the economic impact of the plan And for the most part things dont look good for the small Pacific Northwest towns whose livelihoods revolve around aluminum For the aluminum companies closing plants isnt such a bad thing at least in the short term Besides getting a big chunk of cash from Bonneville the closures will cut nearly of the worlds aluminum smelting capacity Alco a Inc Pittsburgh the worlds leading aluminum producer says its closing its Ferndale Wash smelter idling metric tons or of its annu al capacity With that much aluminum off the market prices once expected to drop amid a slowing economy have instead firmed and are expected to rise Pechiney SA of France the worlds thirdlargest aluminum maker expects prices to jump at least by the end of the year as a result of supplyside bottlenecks Current spot prices for aluminum hover around cents a pound Alcan Inc of Montreal the secondlargest aluminum maker in the world says it expects more growth and better profits from many of its operations including its specialtypackaging business rolling mills and production of primary aluminum Meanwhile producers in India said they plan to take advantage of the bottleneck in the US by boosting exports Outside the Pacific Northwest existing smelters in the US are pretty mu ch operating at capacity says Michael F Gambardella metals analyst for JP Morgan Securities Inc The problems in the Pacific Northwest have kept aluminum prices relatively stable despite the current period of weak demand for aluminum The icing on the cake will be when the US economy starts to recover You will see aluminum prices skyrocket For companies using aluminum as a raw material rising prices may become another burden just as labor and energy costs and dwindling revenue damp profits But the biggest victims will be the rural towns in the Pacific Northwest whose economies have relied on aluminum since after the Great Depression when the US government supplied cheap power to run smelers in hopes of easing high unemployment Economists believe that if aluminum plants close for two years they will likely stay closed Operating aluminum smelters isnt like opening or closi ng a Eleven It costs a lot of money to shut the metalmaking operations dow n and then even more money to reboot the entire operation This is why alumin um smelters and similar factories run hours a day Additionally the way that the smelting operations are configured aluminum companies rack up losses if the plants operate at low capacities And remaining open isnt much of an option after Bonneville signaled that power rates will rise sharply in October when current contracts with the aluminu m companies expire Sharply higher rates will make aluminum production unprofitable For now Alcoa said it will not immediately lay off the employees at th e shuttered Ferndale plant primarily because Bonneville agreed to reimburse Alcoa for employee wages and benefits Still the news of plant closings is sending shock waves through communitie s such as Goldendale Wash a small town on the banks of the Columbia River Together Goldendale Aluminum Co and Northwest Aluminum Co employ about people more than onethird of the immediate areas working populatio n Those aluminum jobs pay about a year in salary and benefits The jobs created by these industries are the lifeblood of our communities say s Mark Sigfrinius Goldendales mayor They cannot be written off To ease the pain Bonneville is hoping that it can strike a deal so that th e aluminum makers in the region will take payments received for shutting down and use that money either to retrain the work force or to provide a lumpsu m payment to help them make it through the two years But the United Steelworkers of America representing workers in the affected Oregon Montana and Washington region says that its skilled work force would probably just leave the region and find work elsewhere under the BPA plan The union is jumping up and down about this says David Foster a negotiator for the union We intend to make absolutely sure that money com es to the union workers Two years is a long time

Mexico Seen As MediumTerm Solution To Californ ia Power Shortage Rate hikes bigger worry than blackouts poll says By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May The vast majority of Californians expect to be inconvenienced by power blackouts this summer but twothirds continue to be far more concerned abo ut higher electricity rates they believe are unjustified according to a Field Poll released Monday Meanwhile percent of the states residents say they have cut back their energy use since the crisis began and nearly twothirds believe they can conserve an additional percent to percent As they were at the outset of the crisis poll respondents remain skeptical of the power shortages root cause Nearly six out of say the crisis is an attempt by energy companies to increase rates rather than the results of a real market imbalance As the seriousness of the issue has gone up the cynicism has remained high said Mark DiCamillo director of the San Franciscobased poll The public still doesnt buy the claim that its supply and demand They think its an artificial crisis The poll results obtained by interviewing a crosssection of adults between May and Sunday are part of a special survey the Field Institute undertook to measure public opinion about the energy crisis Subsequent releases will survey attitudes about the available policy options and the policymakers who might exercise them Mondays results show Californians are reacting negatively to higher electricity rates even though the most recent increase has yet to appear o n their monthly bills In a finding nearly identical to Fields January survey percent are mor e concerned with higher rates than power blackouts And that does not bode well for the elected officials trying to solve the problem DiCamillo said Pocketbook issues such as rate increases he said focus more public opinion on the actors in this drama the politicians A majority percent believes the billion rate increase approved by t he state Public Utilities Commission last week for customers of Pacific Gas an d Electric Co and Southern California Edison was not justified and an identical proportion believes the rate increase will cause a somewhat or very serious problem in their households The proportion of people who believe the increases will cause very serious problems corresponds to their family income Among those earning or less percent believe the increases will cause very serious problems Te n percent of those earning or more believe very serious problems will occur In contrast percent say blackouts have caused a great deal or some inconvenience thus far although percent believe expected blackouts this summer will cause the same degree of inconvenience More lowincome residen ts percent say they will experience a great deal of inconvenience from summer blackouts compared with just percent of those in the and above category who feel the same way The poll shows that the percent of respondents who estimated they have conserved power have cut back on average about percent Gov Gray Davis has asked all residents and businesses to reduce power use by percent although Davis plan assumes a percent reduction Eightyfive percent also say they can conserve even more with additional savings on average amounting to percent Six out of believe the state can avoid blackouts this summer through conservation These numbers are a good guess as to what real conservation is being achieved and what is likely to be achieved and its not a huge amount DiCamillo said The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or Energy Digest Halfhour warning for blackouts Published May Grid operators are hoping to issue power blackout warnings a halfhour in advance but the new alerts would be educated guesses and blackouts might n ot follow The proposed warning system is expected to be approved Thursday by the boar d of the California Independent System Operator the Folsombased organizatio n that runs most of the states highvoltage transmission system Although an unknown number of the alerts will turn out to be false alarms this would be a huge step forward for businesses said Carl Guardino hea d of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a member of the ISO board For employers a halfhour is the time needed to fire up a major generator to power down an assembly line to have your employees save what they have on their computers he said By comparison the last two rounds of rotating blackouts came with two and sixminute warnings Guardino said The new system could be put in place by June and might also include expanded systems for giving email notifications of power alerts or potenti al blackouts ISO officials said Carrie Peyton Connell plans to borrow State Controller Kathleen Connell says Gov Gray Davis energy plan doesnt add up Connell said at a news conference Monday that the state will spend money on electricity at a faster rate than anticipated by Davis a fellow Democrat As a result Connell said she expects to borrow about billion this fall to avoid state budget cash shortages in the coming fiscal year We are virtually in the same kind of fiscal environment that we were in a bad budget year Connell said In recent years the state has regularly borrowed money through oneyear revenue anticipation notes to avoid cashflow problems The notes are paid off within a year when enough tax money flows to the state treasury But Connell didnt have to resort to borrowing this year because of plentif ul revenue and a healthy reserve Connell said the states energy purchases have changed the picture and called into question Davis assumptions The governors plan calls for percent of the power purchases in the first half of this year to be covered by lowercost longterm contracts As of last week only percent of the purchases were under contracts Connell said But Joe Fichera Davis financial adviser said that seven more longterm contracts for electricity during peak demand periods this summer will be delivered to Connells office today John Hill Suit to seek price caps The state Legislature plans to file suit today in federal court in a bid to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on power prices The lawsuit will argue that the commission has failed to ensure that Californians are paying just and reasonable rates as required under the Federal Power Act The suit is being filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DSherman Oaks Hertzberg said consumer groups and others are also expected to join the suit As evidence the suit will cite reports earlier this year by the California Independent System Operator that the states electricity market was not resulting in just and reasonable rates The ISO is responsible for running the states transmission grid The suit will cite evidence of how high power rates are causing harm to society Hertzberg said John Hill US attacks special rate Before the idea goes any further the federal government Monday asked state utility regulators to junk a proposal for a special highpriced federal energy rate In an emergency appeal federal officials asked the state Public Utilities Commission to take a special vote Thursday to drop the idea of even researching a pilot program calling it discriminatory and a waste of time As part of a vote last week that created new electricity rates the PUC als o launched a study into charging all federal facilities marketbased prices f or power a move widely seen as a dig against federal authorities who have refused state pleas to cap wholesale prices But three of the five PUC commissioners said at the time that they disliked the idea and would consider other options Given their reluctance it would be a waste of utilities scarce resources to even begin researching how to assess the special rate the Department of th e Navy wrote the PUC on Monday arguing on behalf of all federal executive agencies Carrie Peyton Whats the hangup Clotheslines save energy and money but they are considered unsightly by so me and are banned in many areas By Mary Lynne Vellinga Bee Staff Writer Published May Rising electricity rates have prompted Stacey Swett to seriously consider taking a step she finds somewhat distasteful hanging a clothesline in her back yard I dont really like the looks of them but you have to get past that we have a huge issue here with our SMUD bill Swett said The California Energy Commission touts clotheslines as a nearly costfree w ay to conserve electricity Statewide clothes dryers burn about megawat ts of electricity on a hot summer day which could be enough to avert a blacko ut on days when state power supplies are tight An electric dryer costs about a year to run A retractable clothesline will set you back about People appear to be getting the message Hardware stores report a sharp ris e in clothesline sales since the energy crisis hit People are going back to the old way of doing things said Dave Haskin owner of Broadway Hardware in Sacramento But the old way of doing things doesnt sit so well in some newer neighborhoods Where Swett lives in midtown she can decide for herself whether to take the plunge and pin up the bloomers But in many newer neighborhoods those governed by homeowners associations the practice is not allowed Swett works for the management company that runs the homeowners association for the gated Pocketarea subdivision of Riverlake In Riverlake it is against the rules to hang your laundry where your neighbors can glimpse it The same is true in Gold River Rancho Murieta Laguna West and Los Lagos the mansionstudded Granite Bay enclave where Sacramento Kings stars Chris Webber and Jason Williams live People think clotheslines are unsightly said Dan Kocal owner of the Folsombased Kocal Management Group His company manages the homeowners associations for communities in the Sacramento region Not one of them allows clotheslines unless they are shielded from neighbors views below th e fence line or behind a special enclosure When people buy into planned communities such as Gold River Los Lagos or S un City they agree to certain rules designed to keep the neighborhood looking neat and uniform Kocal said You agree that youre only going to park in the garage that youre not going to hang out clothes and that youre not going to paint your house purple Kocal said Clotheslines that can be seen from neighboring yards are banned by virtuall y all the California subdivisions and condominium complexes governed b y homeowners associations said Richard Monson president of the Pasadenabas ed California Association of Homeowners Associations We choose to live in neighborhoods that dont hang these things out Mons on said A few weeks ago Monson was quoted as saying that the sight of hanging laundry is akin to graffiti in your neighborhood Cartoonist Garry Trudea u since has devoted an entire week of his Doonesbury strip to lampooning neighborhoods that dont allow clothes to be hung out to dry Now Monson chooses his words more carefully When we talk about areas of communities that are less desirable we often associate those with undesirable items that are in proximity to the buildings he said He stan ds by his assertion that the sight of clothes flapping in the breeze could kno ck percent off property values Brian Rosebrock a supervisor at the new Home Depot in Elk Grove doesnt understand the stigma When he was growing up in a rural area outside New York City his mother always dried the familys clothes on the line Rosebrock still likes the smell of sundried clothes He hangs his jeans socks sheets and other cotton items in the back yard of his Rosemon t house Its just laundry Everybody is a little uptight here he said of Californians He may have a point Bruce Hackett professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California Davis said Californians harbor more negative attitudes toward clotheslines than do people in the Midwest where line drying is more of a tradition About years ago Hackett did a survey of UC Davis students and singlefamily households in Green Bay Wis At the time some students livi ng in married housing on the UC Davis campus were upset that they had to walk to an isolated screened area next to the trash bins to hang their laundry The housing office said clotheslines make the place look like a tenement Hackett said The attitude in Wisconsin was markedly different On wash day there were just clotheslines everywhere which is something y ou dont find here Hackett said One woman told me that when you move into a new home its not really your home until your clothesline is up and your clothes are on it In the wake of student complaints the university eventually changed the policy to allow the use of retractable clothes lines in the housing area Hackett said Leaders of several Sacramentoarea homeowners associations said they couldn t think of any instance in which a homeowner has asked permission to hang a clothesline or has gotten in trouble for using one I dont know of anyone who has a clothesline said David Brickell president of the Los Lagos Estates Homeowners Association He said the Los Lagos neighborhood is very concerned about the energy crisis and thus woul d certainly consider allowing clotheslines To save energy the subdivision has started turning off its entrance founta in at night and is considering buying a smaller fountain pump Monson head of the statewide association argued that there are many ways to conserve energy without resorting to the public airing of laundry Wet clothes can for instance be hung in the garage or the utility room he said The issue is not clotheslines the issue is conservation and homFeowne rs dont have to hang their clothes out of doors he said But some energyconscious citizens think discouraging the use of outdoor laundry lines is ridiculous given the states energy situation Jennifer Putnam recently purchased a large umbrellastyle apparatus to dry clothes in her Jackson back yard We were standing outside by the electric meter at one point two or thre e months ago My husband said Look at how fast that thing is going around I said The only thing on is the dryer During World War II we had to do certain things Putnam continued Now were looking at a power crunch were looking at saving an economy in California Thats critical Thats important I really dont think Gr anite Bay is going to turn into a slum because people put up things to dry their clothes on The Bees Mary Lynne Vellinga can be reached at or Dan Walters One year later we know it wasnt just a simple game of golf Published May California will mark but certainly not celebrate an anniversary this week It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over S an Diego and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power San Diego Gas Electric Co began charging its customers high marketoriented rates for juice It was the beginning of the California energy crisis or at least of public and political awareness that something was wrong And a year later every aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse We are paying times as muc h for power as we were two years ago We have amassed more than billion i n private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consume r power rates And we face potentially lifethreatening summer blackouts Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year They g o back to decisions in the s to stop major power plant construction and rely on conservation and alternative generating sources And they include a momentous decision in the mids to adopt a deregulation plan that was an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the mercy of outofstate generators Of more currency is what was and wasnt done in the last months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled and perha ps uncontrollable firestorm Gov Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays golf one hole at a time Unfortunately for Davis and for the state it was not a golf game but one of threedimensional and perhaps fourdimensional chess To manage the crisis effectively the Democratic governor needed the ability either personally or through trusted aides to pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole The golfing approach was evident from the beginning as Davis dealt with on ly the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved rather than embracing it wholly and actively Private and public energy experts warned that what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and proposed that the deregulation be suspended that rates be raised slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into longterm supply contracts to stabilize the market But Davis and his handpicked state Public Utilities Commission president Loretta Lynch stalled for time Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced the PUC voted to authorize longterm supply contracts at about cents a kilowatthour slightly higher than wholesale prices had been but ridiculously cheap by contemporary standards Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price escalation and quickly locked up longterm supplies but Lynch denounced th e commission action as a wrong turn that could lead to higher consumer bill s and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by Davis Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively Davis Lynch an d the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego rolling back retai l rates without addressing either supply or cost issues Within weeks privat e utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesal e costs skyrocketed Last summers failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment It s clear now for example that it was a mistake for the state to continue buying power at skyhigh rates when the utilities had exhausted their credi t Having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the market would bear A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud but didnt Davis is busily rewriting history and blaming others principally Republicans for t he dilemma But the governor cannot or should not escape the responsibility for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf or like so me routine political dispute and thus failing to apply the aggressive and sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset As Gen George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the Civil War the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage The Bees Dan Walters

blackouts mount residents are losing faith in their governments ability to deal with the one issue underlying this crisis and almost everything else that happens in the state population growth Energy and growth in fact are intertwined in the minds of everyday Californians to an extent not yet reflected in the debate inside the Capito l according to the results of a new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California More than threequarters of those surveyed statewide said they believe population growth contributed to the electricity shortage And even if the energy crisis fades people expect other problems associated with growth to worsen The crisis in other words has only heightened a sense that many people already had a feeling that Californias famous quality of life is threaten ed by rapid growth and our failure to provide the public works and services needed to make growth tolerable For the first time since the mids more people say the state is headed in the wrong direction percent than in the right direction percent And percent said they expect bad economic times in the year ahead That s a quick decline from January when a majority said they thought the state w as on the right track and percent expected good economic times ahead There is some deepseated anxiety about the way government works the way we plan for the future the way we make law the way big decisions are made by the governor and the Legislature said Mark Baldassare a Public Policy Institute researcher who conducted the poll People didnt have a great de al of confidence in local and state government to begin with and now they hav e even less Asked to cite the most important problem facing the state percent named energy But fully onequarter of those surveyed said growth or related problems the environment housing and transportation were on the top of their list Just percent named schools as the top problem a big drop from a year ago and the same number cited the economy Other perennial favorites crime health care taxes barely registered on the scale By a wide margin Californians view growth as inevitable but that doesnt mean they have to like it More than in said the states anticipated climb from million people to million by will make California a less desirable place to live Six in said traffic congestion is already a big problem in their community and percent said it was somewhat of a problem Nearly threequarters said the availability of housing was a problem Sixtyfour percent said air pollution was a problem and percent complained about t he lack of opportunity for wellpaying jobs The polls respondents were conflicted about how best to deal with these problems A large majority favored local control rather than letting the state taking a more active role in guiding growth and development Yet an astounding percent said local governments in a region should work togeth er rather than each city and county deciding growth issues on its own But in a reflection of their lack of confidence in government percent said local citizens should make growth decisions by voting on ballot initiatives while percent said it would be better for local officials t o make those calls after thorough planning reviews and public hearings A little more than half percent said they would vote today for an initiative to slow the pace of development in their community even if it meant having less economic growth What does all this mean for the political world Its been clear for months that the energy crisis was sapping Gov Gray Davis popularity in the state and this poll confirms that trend Six in say they disapprove of the way Davis has handled the energy crisis and his overall approval rating has slipped to percent from percent in January Conventional wisdom has been that if Davis could somehow find his way throu gh the energy crisis he still could cruise to reelection But that may no longer be the case Sixtyseven percent of residents say the crisis has mad e them less confident in the state governments ability to plan for the futur e Gone is the optimism Californians once had that growth would produce a more vibrant economy and make life better for us all Californians have a vaguely uneasy feeling that things are slipping out of control that no one really has a grip on where this state is going and how we are going to get

on county utility plan Backers blame SDGE for bills demise in Assembly committee By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO An Assembly committee yesterday thwarted a bipartisan effort to ease the way for San Diego County to form a municipal utility district that backers say would bring residents cheaper and more reliable power Proponents of the plan said San Diego Gas Electric and its parent company Sempra engineered a political power play that ensured defeat of the proposal The utility was the main opponent Their lobbyists just got on this thing and killed it said Bill Horn chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors who attended yesterdays hearing before the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee They did a tremendous disservice to residents of San Diego County But a lobbyist for Sempra told the committee that forming a municipal utili ty wouldnt solve the energy crisis because it would do nothing to increase th e supply of electricity Were not in the middle of a utility crisis said lobbyist Cindy Howell Its a generation crisis The bill which would have applied only to San Diego County had strong bipartisan support from local officials including state Sens Steve Peace DEl Cajon and Dede Alpert DCoronado who took the unusual step of personally testifying before an Assembly committee But the proposal earned just three of the votes needed to clear the committee All of the votes came from Republicans The bills author Assemblyman Mark Wyland REscondido blasted the stockholderowned utility company for opposing the bill They simply dont want a threat to their ability to make as much money as they can on the backs of San Diego ratepayers he said Proponents say forming a public utility would allow residents to tap cheape r sources of power especially future hydroelectric power planned by the San Diego County Water Authority They argue that controlling some power plants could reduce the countys dependence on expensive electricity now purchased by SDGE on the wholesale market That in turn could lead to lower utility bills During the current energy crisis communities with publicly owned power including Los Angeles and Sacramento have paid much lower energy bills tha n communities served by investorowned utilities But current state law makes it difficult to create a local municipal utilit y because it requires a majority of voters to endorse the plan in an election in which at least twothirds of registered voters turn out As a practical matter that means approval likely would occur only during a presidential election when voter interest is high Peace said the current law was written for a reason to protect privately owned utilities The law was written on purpose by this Legislature to make it almost impossible to form a municipal utility district he said Wylands legislation Assembly Bill would have changed the law to allo w majorityvote approval in the new district without regard to how many vote rs turn out A proposal to create a municipal utility would have to go through months of local hearings before it could be placed on the ballot Wyland said he didn t expect the new agency to replace SDGE but merely to give residents more options over the long term Initially Sempra opposed the bill because it would have given the new publ ic agency the power of eminent domain to take over transmission lines and othe r facilities owned by SDGE At the hearing yesterday Wyland offered to strip eminent domain power from the new agency But Howell the Sempra representative still opposed the plan and argued th at there is no reason to change the voting requirement in the current law Forming a utility district she said is a significant step that should require high voter turnout The bill also drew opposition from unionized employees of Sempra Committee chairman Rod Wright DLos Angeles voted against the bill sayin g it was vague and that San Diego legislators should get a better idea of wha t they want to do He left open the possibility that he would support a proposal to allow the county to buy power but not to form its own utility Wright widely considered an ally of the privately owned utilities receive d last year in contributions from Sempra according to the Secretary of States Web site Other members of the committee objected to the proposed structure of the ne w utility which would be governed by a ninemember board of two supervisors two San Diego City Council members three council members from county citie s and two public members The proposal seemed to turn the political parties positions on public powe r upside down The measure failed to win any votes from Democrats who enthusiastically endorsed a new state power authority that allows California to finance buy and seize power plants But the plan was supported by three Republicans including Assemblymen Jay La Suer of La Mesa David Kelley of Idyllwild and Bill Leonard of Rancho Cucamonga Republicans opposed the state power authority with some calling it socialism Wyland said he may try to resurrect the proposal later in the year Business customers criticize proposed SDGE rate hike By Craig D Rose UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SDGEs commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an averag e of percent more to cover the states soaring cost of buying electricity At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers We need rates we can depend on said John Roberts who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos SDGE customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation and the utilitys residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state capped rates at cents per kilowatthour The SDGE cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as t he commission moves to increase SDGEs rates to levels now paid by customers of PGE and Edison which are about cents per kilowatthour higher Yesterdays hearing however was for commercial rates Roberts said his San Marcosbased irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition he said Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive If businesses leave the state theyll be without jobs and a savings on their power bills wont mean much Roberts said The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about people An additional hearing is scheduled at pm today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center N Coast Highway Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases Date s for those hearings have not been set State sends million to company part of April bill By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California million went to an Atlantabased firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month April Mirant formerly Southern Energy says more than half of the power came fro m three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific G as and Electric for million under a failed deregulation plan State Treasurer Kathleen Connell who displayed a blownup copy of the chec k at a news conference yesterday said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap longterm power contracts and will have to borrow more than the billion planned Connell an elected official who issues state checks said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday totaling billion provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity is dropping and that it will contin ue to drop through the summer But a consultant for Gov Gray Davis said the state which has more longte rm contracts than Connell has seen is on track to control power costs with th e aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners a Davis consultant Its the expect ed scenario The state plans to issue a bond of up to billion in late August that will repay the generalfund taxpayer money used for power purchases about billion so far The bond will be paid off over years by utility customer s Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to for ce disclosure Connell said she has received contracts from power suppliers She declined to release details of the contracts saying they are complicated a nd have varying prices Connell said the check for issued to Mirant Friday is one of t he largest she has written since taking office in This purchase was made entirely at spotmarket prices Connell said eve n though the Department of Water Resources the state agency that purchases power has an executed longterm contract with this company Mirant said in a statement that at the request of the state its marketing arm gave the state a helping hand by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state Weve done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf said Randy Harrison Mirants Western chief executive officer an d its wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negati ve light Mirant said its subsidiaries generated million megawatthours in Apri l while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost th e total sold to the state during the month to million megawatthours The firm said the power was sold for an average of per megawatthou r Thats below the average that the state expects to pay on the expensiv e spot market during the second quarter of this year from April through June But its well above the average price of per megawatthour said to have been obtained in the first round of longterm contracts negotiated by the state Mirant purchased three power plants from PGE capable of producing megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossilfuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide lowco st power to California The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than megawatts The largest group of plants megawatts went to AES Corp of Virginia Three Texas firms purchased plants producing megawatts The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state More heat means more air conditioning and a greater strain on the system But starting next month the states electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site power warnings when there is at least a percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next hours The ISO will issue a power watch when lesscritical shortages are anticipated in advance of high dema nd days The agency also plans to give a minute warning before it orders utilitie s to cut power to customers posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site Its Web site address is There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better Thats what we are trying to do ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley said ODonley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out including whether emails or pagers might be used In other developments in the electricity crisis About million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to households as part of the Power Walk program that began during th e weekend Members of the California Conservation Corps are going doortodoo r in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a million

The state has been importing abou t percent of its power Staff writer Karen Kucher contributed to this report say power woes very serious By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May The overwhelming majority of Californians now regard the states electricit y crisis as a serious problem but say they have not yet been greatly inconvenienced by it a new Field Poll has found The nonpartisan statewide survey found that while people believe the electricity problem is real they believe it stems more from an attempt by energy companies to drive rates up than from an actual shortage They are also far more worried about soaring electricity bills than the threat of blackouts And Californians offered contradictory views as to whether electricity conservation can head off blackouts this summer They believe all electrici ty consumers residents businesses and government can reduce their usage enough to avert blackouts But they also say they already have cut back the ir own usage about as much as they can In January the Field Poll surveyed public attitudes about the growing electricity crisis At the time percent characterized the situation as very serious Now the percentage of the population that considers the situation very serious has grown to percent Californians also hold a rather cynical view of the crisis Thirtysix percent say they believe it is the consequence of an electricity shortage but percent say it was caused by energy companies seeking to increase profits The Field Poll is based on telephone interviews with California adult s conducted between May and Sunday According to statistical theory the poll would be accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points So far the ill effects of the electricity crisis are ones Californians see m to be willing to live with But they worry that will not be the case much longer Eleven percent said they had been inconvenienced a great deal by blackout s But looking toward the summer percent said they expected blackouts to b e a major inconvenience Likewise percent said the electricity rate increases averaging perce nt that have taken effect have been a very serious problem for them If rates were to go up another percent percent would regard that as a serious problem Opinion is divided over the merits of recent rate increases approved by the state Public Utilities Commission Fortyone percent called them justified and percent called them unjustified Its not overwhelmingly panned which I suppose is about as well as could be expected on an issue like this said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll Its almost like a tax increase The public doesnt want i t its just whether they think its justified or not Looking ahead percent say blackouts are the greatest threat posed by th e electricity crisis But more than twice as many percent say they are more concerned about escalating electricity bills By a significant ratio percent to percent Californians believe additional conservation measures by all electricity users can eliminate the need for summer blackouts But when it comes to their own electricity consumption they say they alrea dy have cut back significantly and cant do much more Californians say they have reduced their household electricity usage by an average of percent They said they could cut back by another percent in their homes without causing serious problems If the state is looking and the governor is looking for redoubled efforts its going to be painful because the public thinks we can do a little bit more but not a lot said DiCamillo Governor told to try seizure in power war By Philip J LaVelle UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May A major San Diego business group urged Gov Gray Davis yesterday to take emergency steps in the energy crisis including seizing power plants an action the governor said may be in the cards Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego Building Owners and Managers Association overseers of about commercial properties here The meeting at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown was closed to the media In remarks to reporters later Davis repeated his hard line against outofstate energy producers relating a threat made to a dozen power executives in a private meeting May I told the generators face to face as close as I am to you Gentlemen you are going to lose your plants and Im going to sign a windfallprofits tax unless you help us get through this summer without blackouts and without staggering prices Davis also said he told them You know youve been ripping us off acting in a predatory manner If you do it this summer you leave me no choice but to take your plants and sign a windfallprofits tax So the ball is in your court gentlemen Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had a frank exchange with Davis We want to do our fair share on conservation but were also concerned about the supply side he said The group strongly urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary includin g seizing plants Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of conservation measures Yet some cannot be implemented without state intervention she said For example Davis urged that airconditioning thermostats be set at degrees but a lot of our leases dont permit it she said While in San Diego Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree fro m Scripps Research Institute Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES The head of the California Public Utilities Commission pro vided a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduc ed electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices While testifying before the committee Friday PUC President Loretta Lynch displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last November According to the graphs after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates We certainly see a pattern Lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers Many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent California Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production Lynch said She would not identify the power plants involved however Lynch did say th at they are owned by at least two companies Sen Joseph Dunn who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said Lynchs testimony on its face is very damning He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior During a break in Fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of majo r power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits There has been no collusion said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy Producers Association The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin State to Issue Warnings of Power Outages Electricity CalISO says it will try to give residents and businesses hour notice of probable blackouts By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer courtesy of the energy crisis The Freeway is jammed theres a slim chance of showers and oh by the way theres a likelihood of blackouts By the end of this month the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the states power grid expects to issue hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected It is also piecing together a hightech system to give businesses government officials and the public at least a halfhour notice of a probab le blackout in their area Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air but CalISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more tha n customers a minute via fax and phone and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers CalISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses particularly those in the Silicon Valley that lastminute blackouts were costing California millions The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies o f electricity If Californians electricity use pattern is similar to last years CalISO has projected the state could suffer days of blackouts making increased notification crucial With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the droughtstrick en Pacific Northwest and no new power plants coming online until July the agency calculates that there will be a supplydemand gap in June of megawattsenough power to supply million homes A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted tha t California will experience up to hours of blackouts this summer The weather report and traffic report are good analogies people know they are not accurate but if a blackout really means a lot to them they will check in said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network who serves on the CalISO board Details remain sketchy and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday But a Web page called Todays Outlook on the agencys Internet site wwwcaisocom will be created to illustrate hour by hour how much electricity is available during a hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electrici ty conditions a day in advance They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather but they also will define the level of emergenc y that is expected A power watch will be sounded during stage and stage shortages and a more serious power warning if there is a chance of a stage which often results in blackouts Stage emergencies occur when power reserves drop below stage and stage Most important CalISO is pledging to provide minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric among others In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media CalISO will sound alarms to select email addresses and pager numbers on blast lists or massive computer databases that it will assemble The technology is there This is a war California is in and we shoul d be deploying hightech solutions said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the CalISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification Every time California goes black the economy see s red Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving ju st two to sixminute warnings before blackouts not nearly enough to react A twominute warning may be sufficient in a football game but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public he said Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the mos t of the warnings Florio said residents also will benefit It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners but if someone works at home and sets it up to get an email notice they can take advantage he said In other energy news Monday the woman in charge of paying California s power bills warned that a billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow billion more before it runs out of cash in February Calling a news conference in the capital state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov Gray Davis financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis The plan assumes the billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases an d cover future power buys for the next two years Connells opinion is notable because as the states chief check write r the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through longterm contractsdata that Davis has largely kept secret Davis advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connells warnings Businesses May Seek Blackout Exemption Energy PUC will accept new applications which would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writer The San Francisco Giants want one and so presumably do most other California businesses an exemption from the rolling blackouts that experts say are all but certain this summer But whether operating on a baseball diamond or in more mundane venues far from the bright lights of pro sports few businesses will be granted su ch waiversand then only to minimize threats to public health and safetyund er a process detailed Monday by the California Public Utilities Commission It would be nice in a perfect world if we could exempt everyone who asks from rolling blackouts Unfortunately we cant do that Commissioner Carl A Wood said in announcing the procedure for applying for blackout exemptions The PUC already exempts a fairly lengthy list of those whose services are needed to protect public health and safety including fire and police stations and acutecare hospitals Energy experts are predicting blackouts this year ranging from a total of hours at the most optimistic to hours or more based on such factors as historic patterns of electricity usage forecasts for hot weathe r and expectations of diminished hydroelectric imports from out of state Any new business exemptions which would start no sooner than August would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety That means a business would not be granted an exemption from outages just because it fears revenue loss Wood said at a Los Angeles news conference Residential customers will be unable to apply for the exemptions Nevertheless many already enjoy blackout protection by quirk of location if they share a circuit with an exempt customeror if they are customers of t he Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and municipal utilities such as those in Glendale and Burbank that do not rely on the statewide power grid for electricity The PUC can approve only a limited number of blackout exemptions Wood said because to maintain system reliability a pool of customers representing at least of total system load must be available for rollin g power outages Statewide about of system load is exempt from blackouts in the territories served by the three big investorowned utilities Edison Internationals Southern California Edison PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric This is not an exercise in determining who is most affected economically by rolling blackouts Everyone is affected economically by rolling blackouts Wood said The PUC has set up a Web site wwwrotatingoutagescom and tollfree number for businesses seeking information and applications The deadline to apply is pm June Completed applications will be reviewed by an engineering consulting firm Exponent Inc of Menlo Park Calif which will develop a priority li st based on risk to public health and safety Only businesses that have applied would be considered for exemptions Wood said explaining that the commission will not excuse entire industries The PUC is expected to vote on the exemptions by Aug Wood said several companies already have applied including the operators of Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco home of the Giants major league baseball team Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency Power Lawmakers try a new idea a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose dang er to people law enforcement and even water supply By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOLegislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursin g homes children in day care centers law enforcement and its ability to fig ht crime and the states drinking water supplies Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs the lawsuit takes a new tack homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California s energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set just and reasonable wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and the city of Oakland A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California the draft says The public health safety and welfare of the states million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats Until now most California officials including Gov Gray Davis have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state which has spent more than billion buying electricity since January In the lawsuit Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes frail elderly people are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks drip IVs dialysis machines and electricitypowered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men women and children with disabilities the suit says They represent an imminent threat to life health and independence Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the US th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco bypassing the federal trial court Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso a professor at McGeorge Law Scho ol in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue But after Cotchett spoke with him Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit Lets face it said Kelso a Republican this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months Watching the Water Supply The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give t o consumers If the water looks cloudy or dirty the warning says you should no t drink it The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality they can boil it or add eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water and let it sit for minutes Most water agencies have backup generators But the suit says that i f an agencys water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage a twohou r blackout can result in twoday interruptions in providing safe drinking wat er because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system California will forecast blackouts and warn the public JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer Tuesday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT AP Eds PMs SACRAMENTO Calif AP The operator of Californias electricity grid is offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint planning to give t he public a halfhours warning before shutting off the lights Beginning May the Independent System Operator also plans to issue warnings similar to weather advisories hours before expected blackouts Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts The utilities have also resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals Definitely its a good idea said Shirley Starr a racetrack employee in the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead If I know its going to happen I won t defrost the refrigerator or something Like some business customers and consumer groups she wondered if minute s warning would be enough A lot of people if they are at work a half hour isnt going to do any good Starr said I think it should be more than minutes said George Aguilar an animal control officer in El Monte It should be at least eight hours Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer The states power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict The outages last to minutes and then skip to anoth er neighborhood Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights trapped people in elevators and caused business losses by bringing production lines to a halt People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters I t will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the gri d could be headed toward blackouts The ISO will issue minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit Its better than no notice said John Handley of California Independent Grocers He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and even move items to cold storage if necessary Once the power goes out we cant ring anyone up Handley said Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted witho ut risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce said Brad Ward president a nd chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California For example a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piec e of metal If power is shut off suddenly the acid might not be removed in time and the piece would be ruined This is really really good news Ward said The ISO said it also is looking into hightech ways it can get word of an impending

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews State regulators admitted yesterday that almost twothirds of Northern California power customers will be hit with higher electricity rates contradicting an earlier claim that half of all consumers would be untouche d by rising bills Meanwhile officials and utility executives said bills could go even higher if lawmakers try to reduce the number of households suffering rate hikes A preliminary vote on the matter by the state Senate Energy Committee is scheduled for today In adopting the biggest rate increase in California history the Public Utilities Commission told consumers that half of all residential ratepayers would be unaffected by higher bills This is roughly the case for customers of Southern California Edison but Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that at least percent of its residential customers will experience higher bills as of June I never had a great deal of confidence that percent of people would be exempt from rate increases said PUC member Carl Wood I was surprised by the percent number Nevertheless Wood was one of three Democratic appointees on the five memb er commission who voted in favor of the rate plan which included a tiered system under which the heaviest power users would face the steepest increas es in monthly bills Residential customers who can stay within percent of socalled baseline usage would experience no rate increases Weve been sold a false bill of goods said Medea Benjamin head of the S an Francisco consumer advocacy group Global Exchange The PUC made a huge poi nt of saying that half of all people would be unaffected They cant promise o ne thing and then do something else RUSH JOB Regulators admit they were in a hurry to get a rate system adopted in time for PGE and Edison to begin collecting the higher fees in their June bills For this reason they went ahead with last weeks vote even though it was apparent that less than half of all residential ratepayers would be able to stay within percent of baseline as outlined by the tiered system If we wanted to do it perfectly we would never have gotten it done Wood said We cant get the baseline adjusted before the end of the summer eve n at an accelerated pace Because electricity rates have been linked to baseline usage this once esoteric calculation has taken center stage in Californias energy mess BASELINE USAGE The baseline usage figure included on PGE bills was devised nearly years ago to define the amount of fuel necessary to supply a significant portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer according to the Public Utilities Code It includes several variables such as climate time of year and type of fuel However the last time regulators tabulated baseline numbers was in meaning that the figures on most peoples bills no longer reflect actual power consumption This was precomputers preInternet and pre a lot of other things that a re now in the house said Richard Bilas a Republican PUC member who opposed last weeks rate hike The average baseline for most households is about kilowatt hours per month according to the numbers To be exempt from rate hikes a household thus would need to use no more than kilowatt hours However regulators and utilities now say that actual power usage for the typical home is at least kilowatt hours per month well above most peoples baseline amounts Its not possible to stay within percent of that Bilas said I know I cant do it NEW BASELINE CRITERION With regulators set to begin reexamining baseline numbers Thursday the Senate Energy Committee is seeking ways to make the tabulation more equitab le by adding a new criterion to the figure household size Now a family of five with computers electronic games and almost roundthe clock power consumption would have the same baseline as the bachelor living next door who is rarely home That disparity would be addressed by a bill to be submitted today by Sen Jackie Speier DHillsborough who wants household size to be a factor in determining baseline with the baseline limit rising in proportion to the number of people in the residence Baseline is a totally unfair measure of the number of people in a household she said Families are severely impacted Robert Herrell Speiers staff director said state authorities would rely on selfcertification for each household to accurately report its number of occupants essentially the honor system The last thing you want to do is create baseline police he said Hopefully people wouldnt game the system But Akbar Jazayeri director of revenue and tariffs for Southern California Edison said that even if regulators succeed in adjusting baseline figures to better reflect household size and usage levels this only would increase th e number of ratepayers who can stay within percent of revised limits That means more people would be exempt from rate increases Jazayeri observed There would be less revenue from ratepayers so you would have t o get other people to make up for it In other words another rate increase Well need another rate increase if we mess around with baseline warned the PUCs Bilas Email David Lazarus at Who uses how much Most PGE residential customers do not stay within percent of baseline power usage which means they will be subject to a rate increase Customers as a percentage of baseline use Up to Up to Up to More than Source PGE Chronicle Graphic Energy crisis not real states residents say But poll results show most expect more blackouts Carla Marinucci Chronicle Political

in the publics view no one has bee n able to stop them No one is winning this The findings of the latest Field poll Three quarters of the Californians polled deemed the energy crisis very serious and percent said somewhat serious compared with just percent who said they didnt see it as a problem That is similar to a California Public Policy Institute survey released Monday that showed percent of those polled believe the energy crunch is a big problem Despite the widespread media coverage of the effects of blackouts many Californians said they were not personally inconvenienced the poll results showed Just percent reported being inconvenienced a great deal by blackouts and another percent say they have been affected some by the problems compared with percent who said theyd had a

ramping allegations first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday outrageous acts of manipulation Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law legislati on could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future Were looking at it yes from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced t o render it a violation for future such acts Dunns committee already has been investigating charges that power generato rs gamed the wholesale energy market to boost their profits The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants sometimes several times within an hour Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants The senate committee which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power generating companies Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine whic h plants employed the ramping tactic He added that the issue would be examin ed in a public hearing in the coming weeks Meanwhile pressure continued to

operator may send voice email messages Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Tuesday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Sacramento Californians will receive minutes warning that blackouts may be imposed enough time it is hoped to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection the states power grid managers said yesterday The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms We want a system that is proactive said Carl Guardino an ISO board memb er and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes warning Two minutes may be fine in a football game but its not fine for Californias economy or safety ISO officials also said they are examining hightech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass emails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages The plan detailed in a report issued yesterday still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a buyers cartel that would refuse to pay fo r power when prices become too high Its not the report I was expecting but minutes of notice is certainly better than two said Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray No matter how y ou slice it this summer is going to be miserable The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cos t the state economy billion said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses In this electrically unreliable world any notification manufacturers can get is good said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the association While minutes wont be enough for some for most manufacturers it will be sufficient The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmaker s regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts said Michael Florio an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network There are bigger public policy ramifications Florio said The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the changes are just updates of policies already in place WARNING OF PROBABLE BLACKOUTS The minute advancenotification system scheduled to go into effect earl y next month would warn of probable blackouts including the amount of loa d that will have to be curtailed in each service area Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts The utilities also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much i s available It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly email This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations said ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley Also planned by the ISO is a Power WatchPower Warning system that would provide a hour notice of highdemand days Under the twotiered system a Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a percent chance of a Stage Three aler t With one report suggesting California may see as many as hours of rolli ng blackouts this summer lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to ma ke the outages easier for power customers to cope with The idea of a buyers cartel the subject of a Capitol hearing today would have California in partnership with other states set a firm ceiling o n what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity The tradeoff would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if th e state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS Meanwhile Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno will introduce a bill today that would require the states utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block For example a customer located in Block of Pacific Gas and Electric Co s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June if blackouts are needed that day Right now every day is a potential blackout day Briggs said This way people would know when their potential days are On alert When demand is high the ISO will forecast peak demand power supply and weather hours in advance A power watch will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Sta ge system is within of running out of power or Stage system is withi n of running out of power A power warning will be issued when there is at least a chance of a Stage alert demand is within of supply Who calls a blackout Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the states power consumption When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below percent of available capacity the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice Officials said this week they would give minutes notice before blackouts begin The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut Q Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long A Thats up to the utilities PGE has divided its million customers into blocks each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time The blocks are defined by PGEs network of circuits rather than by geography Thus neighborhoods in San Francisco Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously Q How many users are blacked out at once A Each of PGEs blocks represents about megawatts of electricity A megawatt is enough electricity to power homes If PGE is told to cut more than megawatts it can shut down two or more blocks at a time PGE also can bla ck out smaller portions within each block if the ISOs requirements are for le ss than megawatts Q How is power shut off A This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand Q How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected A A total of customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan Q Which block of customers will be blacked out next A Some or all customers in Block Q How do I know what block Im in A Look for the words Rotating Outage Block followed by a number on your bill If it says Block you share an electrical circuit with a hospital police station or other essential service that is normally exempt from service cuts Q What should I do when the lights go out A Power experts advise Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damagecausing power surge s when service is restored Leave one light on to indicate when the electrici ty is back Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out Treat all intersections as a fourway stop To protect food open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutel y necessary Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if only your hom e is affected It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PGE or your city electrical bureau When the power returns turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges Dont plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can sen d a highvoltage current through the system that can electrocute power worker s

energy disease I dont mean blackouts and brownouts I mean higher electricity prices which are all but inevitable Retail prices are regulated in most parts of the country But when utilitie s pay more for wholesale power they have to pass it on How much prices rise will depend partly on whether we learn again to conserve Consumers bought into conservation after the energy shocks of the s and early s We not only turned down thermostats and insulated the attic we embraced government intervention and technological change Federal energy standards brought forth more efficient refrigerators and air conditioners New building codes made homes and offices less expensive to heat cool and light Rebate programs helped people buy better lightbulbs and appliances Electricity use grew more slowly than the economy did But in the late s with prosperity in full swing demand began catching up with supply Consumers stopped worrying about their energy bills Hightech businesses gobbled megawatts for lunch Utilities and states California among them closed or scaled back thei r conservation programs Were all freemarket maniacs now The markets were supposed to create efficiency unaided But they havent So while we work out the problems and wait for new plants to come online we need to spread the available power around Energy conservation needs a big push The Bush administration has blinders on when it cuts conservation spending and downplays the need But a marketbased question has also entered the conservation debate Would we save power if it were priced in a different way Most consumers dont realize that the wholesale price of power changes at various times of day Prices spike when demand is high say on summer afternoons and fall at night when most offices have closed But most of us pay a constant price per hour whether we use expensive hour s or cheap ones So we have no incentive to conserve power during hours of hi gh demand Marketbased pricing is intended to get you to think twice before using pow er during those expensive peaks There are three main approaches to this today CHANGING THE FIXED PRICE Many utilities today charge more in the hot summe r months than in the winter months Georgia Power goes further raising you r summer price as you use energy more In the winter your rate for extra kilowatthours declines VOLUNTARY TIMEOFUSE PROGRAMS You pay the most for power during weekday hours and the least on weekends and overnight Oregon will introduce a statewide timeofuse program in October Niagara Mohawk in Syracuse NY has consumers on timeofuse Ahmad Faruqui of the industrys Electric Power Research Institute estimates that a welldesigned timeofuse program could cut residential peak demand by about percent In California that could reduce energy costs by percent over the summer So far however these programs havent persuaded many people to run their washing machines at night Saving or isnt worth the hassle says Mike OSheasy Georgia Powers manager of product design REALTIME PRICING Here the utility varies your price per kilowatthour during the day as its own prices change Using a smart meter and smart thermostat you could program your water heater or air conditioner to turn off automatically during times when power costs the most Many businesses already pay on realtime How consumers like realtime pricing remains to be seen Georgia Power trie d it years ago and dropped it But Gulf Power in Pensacola Fla rolled out newer technology last year an d thinks it has a hit About customers are already online with more on the waiting list even though the smart meters cost them a month People like the control over their power bill says Gulfs Margaret Neyma n general manager of marketing She says customers are saving percent which more than covers their participation cost Puget Sound Energy in Bellevue Wash has enrolled more than customers in a smartmeter program Theyve been getting reports showing when they use power the most and what it costs to deliver This month the utility started tying its smart meters to timeofuse pricing Customers pay less during nighttime hours all day Sundays and holidays Consumer and environmental groups generally havent supported marketbased pricing for homes They blame high prices in part on market manipulation and dont want the power sellers to profit from it They have a case But blackouts and brownouts

literally in a war with energy companies who are pricegouging us the governor said shaking with something that looked an awful lot like emotion Many of those companies are in Texas In typical Davis style the governor is a little late in declaring war on Texas If he had been president in he would have spoken of that day o f infamy in It also was a typical Davis halfmeasure He didnt declare war on all of Texas just the Texans who poll badly in California Those would be George W Bush and his friends and contributors who cut off our power robbed us and then used us as an example of why the nation need s holes punched in Alaska and hundreds of Homer Simpsons put in charge of nuclear fuel rods Davis isnt the type to boldly declare unlimited war on all of Texas certainly not Austin City Limits chili and the Texans we love like Will ie Nelson Tommy Lee Jones Charlotte Mailliard Shultz and Willie Brown But Davis had a Texas stereotype in mind as he spoke of the hardscrabble hombres in Houston highrises who are smart and mean and are holding us up longdistance Yep its as if Texas is saying to California Your money o r your lifestyle Davis said he would retaliate each month by naming a Texas corporation pig of the month Yeah thatll hurt those guys at Reliant Energy and Enron Having Gray Davis on your side in a dustup with a bunch of Texans is like having the head of the high school av crew on your side in a rumble with th e Crips Right now the gashouse gangsters in Houston are having a jeweler make karat gold pigs they can wear proudly in their lapels while they eat steak and laugh at Californians deprived of their sushi because of the loss of refrigeration Texas kids will have bumper stickers on their fuel inefficient scooters saying My dad is a proud pig of the month in

with Texas and theyre a tight bunch who wont take kindly to Davis messing with any of their citizens no matter how rich How is Davis going to match Dont mess with Texas Sorry but California ns are people too wont cut it Long before Davis declared halfwar on Texas a couple of readers suggested that California retaliate by cutting off the supplies of our products to Texas specifically wine This of course is indication of Californians isolation from mesquite reality There may be six guys in Texas who ever order wine with their Tbones and theyre all in Austin The menus say One red Two white Three rose Please order by number And they all might as well be from upstate New Yor k If California were the worlds only producer of beer and tequila then we might have a chance of beating Texas by

Blackout alerts forecasts proposed Posted at pm PDT Monday May BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News Under pressure to give more notice before pulling the plug Californias power grid managers Monday proposed issuing alerts a halfhour before blackouts and forecasting the likelihood of outages a day in advance The Independent System Operators proposal heartened business leaders who s ay unexpected rolling blackouts have cost them millions of dollars But the proposal disappointed consumer advocates and some lawmakers who hop ed grid officials would consider their suggestion to schedule rolling blackout s days or weeks in advance Grid officials compared their proposal to the weather forecasts that alert Midwesterners to tornadoes and cautioned that the predictions are subject to change Its akin to a severe storm watch and a severe storm warning said Greg g Fishman spokesman for the ISO which will consider the proposal Thursday We try to give as much hard information as soon as we can But there are days where those things are going to change very quickly Business leaders said a halfhour warning even if its a false alarm woul d be better than the two to six minutes they got during the last round of rolling blackouts in April Were happy with what the ISO is trying to do said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association It s making a bad situation a little better But critics said the proposal changes little and with frequent blackouts expected this summer urged the state to instead schedule them in advance Its actually quite distressing and disappointing said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which proposed scheduling blackouts If the public is looking for better information on blackouts theyll have to look elsewhere State Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach whose energy committee is considering notification issues today agreed Its not the report I was expecting but minutes of notice is certainl y better than two Bowen said The idea of scheduling blackouts is gaining ground among state lawmakers w ho say it would let people know when to expect outages and also force down runaway power prices by dampening demand The grid operator didnt propose scheduled blackouts because lawmakers havent yet agreed on the concept Its in the talking stage Fishman said Theres nothing firm Rolling blackouts in which utilities cut power from one block of customers for an hour or so and then move to the next block protect the system from total failure when demand threatens to overwhelm supplies Systemwide failu re could take days to fix Bad summer forecast Californians have had six days of rolling blackouts this year and will like ly see many more this summer as powerguzzling air conditioners drive demand as much as megawatts over available supplies A megawatt can power about homes The ISO highlights the potential for blackouts through progressive emergenc y stages Stage the highest level indicates rolling blackouts are possibl e Grid managers alert utilities and public safety officials to conditions by email pager telephone radio and Internet postings and notify the publi c through news broadcasts To date twothirds of consumers say theyre more concerned about power prices than rolling blackouts according to a Field Poll released today Bu t more than seven in expect to be inconvenienced by the outages expected this summer the poll found People in general are much more willing to tolerate blackouts if they kno w theyre going to happen said Guy Phillips energy aide to Assembly Speak er Pro Tem Fred Keeley DSanta Cruz The nature of the electric system makes advance notice of blackouts difficult grid officials said California is so short of power that weathe r changes and power plant shutdowns can dramatically affect the outlook On Monday the state avoided blackouts amid soaring temperatures because of power imported from other states and cooler weather in Southern California said ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley That could change as Southern Californ ia heats up today and Wednesday but blackouts arent expected barring a sudd en plant failure or drop in imports she said National Weather Service forecasters expect a high of degrees in San Jos e today with a low in the upper s tonight Under Mondays ISO proposal grid managers would commit to issuing a minute notice of probable interruptions identifying the affected utilities and how much power they must cut It still would be up to the utilities to determine which areas would be affected The ISO also would issue hour grid advisories If the ISO expects a Stag e or emergency the next day grid managers will issue a Power Watch If there is a percent or greater chance of a Stage emergency the next day the ISO will declare a Power Warning In addition the ISO would bolster the system conditions report on its Web page by adding available supply figures The report now lists only actu al and forecast demand Customers also would be able to sign up for hourly email updates ISO officials also are looking into contracts with notification services offering to alert customers to grid conditions by request through phones faxes emails or pagers We spent the last four months designing this with businesses for businesses said ISO board member Carl Guardino who also heads the Silic on Valley Manufacturing Group The blackouts that hit the Bay Area on June cost Silicon Valley business es million Guardino said adding that he expects the ISO to approve the proposals by months end Chance to do something Every time the lights go out companies see red Guardino said Half an hour actually gives you a chance to do something You can deploy police officers to intersections You can power down assembly lines Others say thats not enough I want days warning said Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno who plans to introduce a bill today that would schedule each utility outage blo ck for a day when blackouts are possible That would help farmers who must have power on specific days for water delivery and crop processing Briggs said State Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego has a bill scheduled for discussion today calling for the state to set a ceiling on what it will pay for power and to schedule outages the next day if there arent enough sellers at that price Guardino said the ISO isnt ruling out scheduled blackouts but is concerne d that such an approach could result in unnecessary outages Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DVan Nuys believes the ISO proposal is a good idea in any case Doing everything we can to let people know whats likely to happen is important said Paul Hefner a Hertzberg aide whether or not we can go forward with some sort of scheduled blackout Blackout season may be heating up Firms may seek PUC lightsout exemptions as more power comes online May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register A sizzling summerlike heat wave could threaten California with rolling blackouts early this week energy officials said The blackouts could hit even as regulators debate the pros and cons of prescheduling blackouts In addition the state Public Utilities Commission will accept applications this week from businesses claiming they must be exempt from having their lights go out Temperatures of over degrees in the Central Valley and degrees in th e Bay area are expected today Southern California will bear the brunt of the heat Tuesday so energy demand could be diffused throughout the state We do expect this upcoming heat wave to be brutal said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator whi ch manages the states electric grid But we cant say for sure well be able to avoid blackouts The good news is that the grid operator expects more than megawatts o f power to be online this week compared with two weeks ago when California endured modest blackouts for two straight days Still about megawat ts of electricity or onequarter of the states capacity will be out of service McCorkle said The ISO plans to release a report today on how scheduled blackouts might work The report is a response to a bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alper t DCoronado that would allow the grid operator to refuse to buy power that is considered too expensive and instead call for rolling blackouts The PUC which has been besieged by consumer complaints might begin hearin gs into inequities in the baseline allocation on residential utility bills Consumers are complaining that baseline which guarantees a subsistence lev el of electricity based on various climate regions throughout the state is no t consistent with energy usage Cheney Forget price caps OPEC pressure Vice president calls for more refineries and review of fuelcontent rules May By BRIGITTE GREENBERG The Associated Press WASHINGTON Capping electricity prices or pressuring OPEC to cut oil pric es will not solve US energy problems Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday in defending a Bush administration energy plan that stresses production ove r conservation While Democrats want immediate relief for Californias power crisis there were few encouraging words from Cheney who led a task force that developed the Bush plan They got into trouble in California over a period of years and its going to take two or three years to get out of it Cheney told CBS Face the Nation There are going to be blackouts this summer For the short term the administration has approved Gov Gray Davis reques ts to expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal offices in the state to reduce energy consumption this summer by percent Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said she was appalled that President George W Bush is not considering price caps or investigating companies that she said are charging exorbitant prices for electricity She noted that both Cheney and Bush are former oil company executives Its really rather stunning because those of us who are living through thi s have suggested many things Boxer told CBS So the vice president sits ve ry coolly and I admire his cool but he really sounds like an oil man not a vice president charged with helping the people If dairy farmers sought as much profit as oil companies in some cases percent a gallon of milk would cost she said Cheney said the answer to longterm price stability lies in building more o il refineries in the United States and in reviewing a system whereby different states require different blends of fuel some mixed with the corn additive ethanol for example to meet cleanair standards Capping prices would not increase the supply of energy or reduce demand Cheney said We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy whether its the oil companies or whoever it might be instead of dealing with the real issues Cheney told NBCs Meet the Press He criticized Davis for what he called a harebrained scheme to use the states budget surplus to buy power Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss said Congress should look into at least temporarily suspending the federal gas tax which is cents per gallon Cheney however said that would pose problems for the nations highway tru st fund which relies on that tax to build and maintain the countrys transportation infrastructure Describing himself as a pretty good environmentalist Cheney also respond ed to criticism from some environmental groups that he did not meet with them before issuing the energy plan because he is beholden to energy producers w ho gave millions of dollars to the Bush campaign I couldnt begin to sit down with all of those various groups I didnt ha ve time he said A nuclear rebirth Despite obstacles it should be in the mix to help ease the electricity crisis May By John Seiler The Orange County Register With the lights and air conditioners set to go out in summer blackouts everyone is scrambling for more energy production Thats why nuclear power is back cleaner safer and more efficient President Bush set the tone in his page energy plan released Thursday calling nuclear power a major component of our national energy policy Th e president wants to make it easier to license new plants and give billi on in tax credits for purchasing nuclear plants to make it easier for industry consolidation And he wants to continue studying the construction of a nuclear waste site in Yucca Mountain Nevada a project that is crucial to California But California faces hurdles The state bans new nuclear construction until the national nuclearwaste site is built and anyone who builds here has to deal with legitimate concerns about earthquake safety and adequate water fo r cooling This state also is a major center for environmentalists who oppose nuclear power Nevertheless advances in technology years of experience and other factors should make nuclear energy a serious candidate for responding to Californias and the nations energy needs Its a good time to think through the history and the potential of this powerful energy producer Nuclear accidents The heyday of the American nuclear power program was the s through when the Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania led to an end to new plans for nuclear power The Three Mile Island accident destroyed the reactor but the core itself remained confined Radioactive gases were vented but there is no accepted evidence that this harmed the public writes John McCarthy a Stanford professor of computer sciences with an extensive Web site on nuclear power wwwformalstanfordedujmcprogressnuclearfaqhtml The last American nuclear plant opened in at Watts Barr in Tennessee years after its construction was given the OK No new plant construction ha s been approved in America since In the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Union now Ukraine exploded from highpressure steam not a nuclear explosion spewing out radiation and casting further doubts on the future of the American nuclear program although no American nuclear reactor ever had anything close to th e shoddy socialist design of the Chernobyl plant At the end of there were civilian power reactor years of experience throughout the world and Chernobyl is the only nuclear power plant accident harming the public McCarthy notes on his site Put another way excluding Chernobyl nuclear power plants have never harmed the public Irrational fears Contributing to the antinuclear atmosphere were such films as s The China Syndrome starring Jane Fonda and s Silkwood starring Meryl Streep And lets not forget one of the funnier skits on Saturday Night Live in in which Dan Aykroyd played President Jimmy Carter who becomes irradiated touring Two Mile Island after an accident and grows in to The Amazing Colossal President In California sentiment was set by thenGov Jerry Brown whose chief of staff was Gray Davis now Californias governor Well its not completely clear to me what a reasonably scientific position is on nuclear power except to say that where there are other potentially less destructive alternatives it doesnt make much sense to rush to increase dependency on nuclear power plants In California there are alternatives such as conservation cogeneration combined cycle geothermal and solar energy In the aggregate they make it possible to slow down the growing use of nuclear power Brown told biographer Orville Schell in Brown published in Foreign countries dont share Americas phobia about nuclear power which provides percent of Frances electricity compared to percent in the United States and percent in California America has operating reactors out of worldwide Surfin San Onofre Youd catch em surfin at San Onofre harmonized the Beach Boys in Surfin USA And the surfers still ride the waves right in front of the nuclear power plant which has been operated in complete safety since The first nuclear reactor built was decommissioned in and is being dismantled The two remaining newer reactors the large cones visible as you drive by on the I freeway are licensed to operate by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission until spokesman Ray Golden told me and could be running until if an extension is granted Put another way if the state had just three more nuclear sites the size of the one in San Onofre there would be no blackouts this summer The state i s expected to be short megawatts San Onofres two reactors together produce megawatts of power megawatts serves about million homes Californias only other nuclear plant is the Diablo Canyon facility which opened in and provides megawatts of power Last Wednesday I toured the San Onofre plant Bechtel workers were fixing o ne turbine on which an electrical circuit breaker had shorted out in February and caused a fire The turbine should be fixed by sometime in June in time for the summer energy crunch It should be noted that the turbine is not the reactor The turbine rotates and creates electricity the same as at any other kind of plant so the fire didnt come close to causing problems for the reactor The nuclear fuel the reactor uses costs about million a year Golden said That works out to a cost of less than cents a kilowatt hour he said but couldnt be more specific because of company policy That compare s to a cost of cents to cents a kilowatt hour for natural gas Regulatory hoops Despite the safety and need for nuclear power there are a number of hurdle s to building new plants especially in California lWaste disposal Currently all American nuclear plants store their nuclear wastes on site such as the large concrete bunkers I saw at San Onofre The waste has to be stored for years Theyre awaiting the potential development of the Yucca Mountain Nevada waste site on which billion already has been spent for studies by the US Department of Energy The si te already was the location of nuclear bomb tests The site will be ready at the earliest in years Barbara Byron nuclea r waste policy adviser for the California Energy Commission told me In the meantime California law stipulates that no nuclear fission thermal powerplant shall be permitted land use in the state until the US government develops a means for the disposal of highlevel nuclear waste Another problem is that President Carter shut down Americas only nuclear waste processing plant in the late s which would have recycled most of the waste immensely relieving the problem In March Sen Pete Domenici of New Mexico introduced S the Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assuran ce Act of which would develop a new waste reprocessing facility lEarthquakes The states unstable geology adds to the risk and cost of building plants here lWater The states lack of water makes it difficult to site new plants Byron said nuclear plants use two and a half times as much water as other plants lIn a deregulated market companies are less likely to pay the billion t o billion a new nuclear plant is estimated to cost Byron said How does that compare The Electric Power Supply Association told me that its difficult to estimate the cost of building and running a new plant whether it uses nuclear natural gas or some other power However the costs of som e recent natural gas plants have ranged from to per megawat t of installed power or as much as million for megawatts of power And given that new naturalgas plants range from to megawatts theres more flexibility in designing and financing projects New technologies But the technology keeps moving forward One thing that should keep costs down is standardized nuclearplant designs an idea that has kept prices reasonable in France In the past each nuclear plant in America was basically designed as a unique unit Since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which regulates all nuclear plants in America has approved three new advanced designs The Advanced Boiling Water Reactor design by GE Nuclear Energy which generates megawatts the System design by Westinghouse formerly ABBCombustion Engineering which generates megawatts and is similar to that used a t San Onofre and the AP design by Westinghouse which generates megawatts Nine other reactor designs have been submitted for NRC review however onl y two the AP and the Pebble Bed Module Reactor are being actively pursued at this time the NRC reports on its Web site wwwnrcgovOPAgmotipfsadvancedrxhtml The AP is a more powerful version of the AP But the Pebble Bed desi gn is new and is called politically correct by those working on it Andrew Kadak told me hes a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog y in the nuclear engineering department He said the new technology is highefficiency heliumcooled It runs at lower temperatures than traditional nuclear plants and uses a different type of fuel It produces less energy per cubic meter Essentially theres no chance for melting because of the lower power density they generate You could put them near population centers because of their safetyEach plant would generate about MW or about one tenth of current plants Construction planned for a plant in South Africa will run million Even if the cost were double i n America he said its still very competitive for natural gas The South African plant will produce power at a cost about cents to cents per kilowatthour about half what natural gas cost two years ago when natura l gas prices were stable the price comparison is even better today since natural gas prices have more than doubled Kadak said the concerns over emitting gasses into the environment the high cost of other fuels and a changing political climate make nukes feasible again Kadak said that the Pebble Bed design can be up and running within four yea rs once a site is approved When will we go nuclear again For the first time in a long time it looks like it might be starting up again Fred Smith told me about nuclear power construction hes head of t he Competitive Enterprise Institute a Washington thinktank that advances new thinking on economic matters Sooner or later we will have a waste facility he said of the Yucca Mountain site The nuclear option is far more viable than most people thought The antinuclear campaign has passed its peak But it will take time I think within the decade well have a new nuclear plant That wasnt true two years ago Moreover natural gas which will power most of the new plants coming onli ne in California will continue to be scarce We havent drilled for it Smith said Its hard to transmit Well have to build more pipelines It s not easy to ship from abroad By contrast nuclear powers fuel prices are almost constant Whats shortcircuiting the construction of nuclear power The same thing that has caused the electricity and other energy crises politics Even though nuclear plants would alleviate concerns real or imagined about global warming by reducing dependency on fossil fuels and coal environmentalists remain opposed

elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The Bees John Hill can be reached at or Californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol l By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a percent to percent margin Californians desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch respondents said By a margin of percent to percent poll respondents say they would maintain airquality standards rather than relax them to build plants That support is down from a Field survey in January when percent said theyd rather maintain standards Moreover a majority percent say they would relax airquality standards to get older plants back in operation an increase from percent in January Slight majorities support a staterun public power authority percent a nd stateowned power transmission lines percent but DiCamillo said that some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines with Democrats in favor percent to percent and Republicans opposed percent to percent Overall the idea was rejected by percent of adults and favored by percent A strong majority of registered voters percent oppose additional offshore

May Desperately seeking megawatts San Diego Gas Electric Co wants to pay local industries to fire up their highpolluting emergency diesel generator s this summer to relieve the electricity grid and avoid rolling blackouts If approved by the state Public Utilities Commission the proposal could increase the regions generating capacity by up to megawatts enough to serve about homes and significantly minimize if not eliminate planne d blackouts Customer willingness to participate has been quite strong if the proper incentives are in place said Debra Reed president of SDGE which serves million consumers in San Diego and southern Orange counties The utility estimates the program would cost million Environmental opposition to date has come mainly from the states chief airpollution enforcer the California Air Resources Board which can influence but has no direct control over air pollution rules set by San Diegoarea elected officials The board contends that the San Diego region which already suffers some of the worst smog in the nation would see its air quality deteriorate further if the notoriously dirty diesel generators are deployed en masse Most diesel generators have few or no pollution controls and megawatt for megawatt spew about times more smogforming emissions of nitrogen oxid es than do new power plants fired by natural gas said Michael Kenny air boar d executive officer The standby diesels also pump out significantly more particles of soot that can lodge deep in the lung and cause cancer The SDGE proposal would expend ratepayer dollars on extremely polluting a nd expensive power decrease participation in more sound conservation programs and not make a significant difference in the number or extent of blackouts Kenny said in a letter of opposition The utilities commission is scheduled to vote on the proposed rolling blackout reduction program Thursday in San Francisco Many utilities have offered similar financial incentives to get businesses off the power grid at times of peak demand The San Diego utilitys plan however would take powershedding where it has not gone before by explicit ly rewarding the use of higherpolluting power sources We have not gone down that path said Kevin Payne Southern California Edisons director of technical support for customers Edison is proposing cleaner alternatives than diesels to get powerintensive businesses off the grid when supplies are tight Officials at Pacific Gas Electric said they too have stopped short of enlisting the use of diesel generators We definitely see merit in being able to avert blackouts and the diesel generator being the tool to do that but we have concerns about the environmental impacts said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Under the San Diego utilitys plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators at the utilitys request and simultaneous disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted Utility officials say the diesels would run in strict compliance with all rules of local state and federal air pollution enforcement agencies But unlike most local air pollution control districts San Diego Countys allow s unlimited use of emergency generators when rolling blackouts appear imminen t Richard Smith assistant director of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District said his board of elected officials believes the deployme nt of backup diesels would not only spare businesses millions of dollars in lo st revenue but would also shield San Diego residents from greater pollution th at would come when even more standby generators kick in during a blackout PGE officials say it would be unfair for one area of the state to avoid power outages by cranking up dirty diesels when other areas of the state go dark spokeswoman Homrig said If there are going to be blackouts it should be blackouts for everybody she said The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om Lawsuit wants to cap cost of power By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau Published May Key lawmakers touted their lawsuit filed Tuesday against federal energy regulators as a lastditch maneuver to relieve California from summer blackouts and high electricity costs Filed on behalf of the Legislature and the city of Oakland the suit charge s that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to fulfill its leg al duties by allowing generators to charge unreasonable rates for power in California The lawsuit filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg seeks immediate caps on wholesale energy rates an d refunds from past purchases The two Democrats noted that power prices shot up from a megawatt in to as high as earlier this year Burton suggested a cap is reasonable The people of California need some relief some protection from these outrageous prices Hertzberg said In our judgment the law is clear i t is clear that the federal regulators are ignoring the law Under the Federal Power Act FERC is charged with setting just and reasonable wholesale energy prices The commission adopted a plan in late April that would cap rates once reserves fall below percent in what is called a Stage power emergenc y But California officials denounced that plan as ineffective noting that th e state needs relief before emergencies strike High energy costs have helped drain more than billion from the states general fund since California began purchasing electricity for utilities in January In addition the state faces at least hours of power blackouts this summer according to the North American Electric Reliability Council Those outages are a health threat to Californias most vulnerable residents Burt on said But Jan SmutnyJones who represents wholesale generators as executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association said a suit would solve none of Californias problems We need to tone down the political rhetoric and fix problems rather than t ry to litigate this he said This lawsuit will not add one megawatt of generation to the system nor will it decrease demand in California Gov Gray Davis who has attacked the Bush administration for not capping energy prices said he supports the lawsuit I support all efforts to recoup the windfall profits that these generators have recovered by gouging our utilities at the cost of having to be passed off in some form or fashion to the customers over time the Democratic governor said The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or All spin no juice Energy debate shifts from policy to politics Published May If the spin machines of the Davis and Bush administrations generated electricity California wouldnt have to worry about blackouts Unfortunately political hot air wont drive a turbine Both Gov Gray Davis and Vice President Dick Cheney have stepped up their fingerpointing campaigns with the governor blaming Bush for abandoning California and Cheney blaming Davis for ignoring the problem until it blew into a crisis But while the governor and the White House play blame games some of the re al policy work sits uncompleted As temperatures soar and June approaches the re is nothing close to a consensus on the three unresolved challenges of the power crisis returning the states investorowned utilities to solvency preventing independent generators from exploiting a broken wholesale power market and keeping alternative generators producing power at reasonable rates For the somewhat distant future some policy pieces have fallen into place The need for more power will be met by plants under construction and in the approval process The states million investment in new conservation a nd efficiency initiatives will dampen demand for power The creation of a stat e public power authority gives California a tool to deal with imbalances in t he electricity marketplace But the immediate crisis offers only unpleasant and controversial choices all of them heavily freighted with political risk Decisions about rescuing the utilities or controlling wholesale prices hinge on different ideologica l views of the proper role of government in the marketplace and the causes of the electricity mess And the stakes are extraordinary both for California s economy and for political positioning in the national battle over energy policy and future elections In the absence of quick policy action though all of the fingerpointers stand to lose Cheney is right about Davis dilatory approach to the power crisis but dead wrong in shirking federal responsibility for what comes next The federal government alone has authority to restrict the wholesale price of power to what is just and reasonable This is the law and the Bus h administration refuses to enforce it As long as the sky is the potential limit on wholesale electricity prices both for purchases past and present its harder for the political system t o resolve the past debts of the utilities and the contractual relationships with alternative generators If the Bush administration wants to turn the political heat on Davis and Sacramento it must do its own job first The only thing preventing that is a near fanatical belief that with electricity the free market can do no wrong Majority supports energy price caps new nuclear plants By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May Californians are sharply divided over a host of proposals to address the energy crisis with a new statewide poll showing caps on wholesale electricity prices the most popular fix and a billion bond to buy pow er for the state the most unpopular The nonpartisan Field Poll shows the Bush administrations refusal to consider energy price controls at odds with Californians who support caps overwhelmingly percent to percent Though that might give Gov Gray Davis ammunition to escalate his criticism of White House passivity in the crisis the most aggressive action the governor has taken to date registers strong disapproval Coalitions generator plan rejected Davis trims outlook for new power Water district may seek additional bids to build power plant Proposed plant caught in citystate tug of war Fiftytwo percent of the California adults surveyed said they oppose the record billion bond issue authorized by Davis and the Legislature to purchase power over the next two years Only percent thought the bond issue was a good idea and percent had no opinion Concerning other proposals percent to percent support creating a staterun power authority to operate power plants and percent to percent favor the state buying transmission lines from utilities A narrow plurality percent to percent opposes the idea of Davis invoking the governors emergency powers to seize power plants The telephone survey was conducted from May to Sunday According to statistical theory such a poll is accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points While the Field Poll shows the energy problems have not shaken Californians longheld opposition to permitting offshore oil drilling and relaxing clea n air standards it revealed a stunning reversal on nuclear power Nearly three in five in the survey percent said they favor building mo re nuclear power plants percent was opposed That represents a turnabout from when percent supported nuclear power plants and percent opposed them The resurgence of public support for nuclear power is something I never would have predicted before we did the survey said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll But its been some years since ThreeMile Island the Pennsylvania nuclear plant accident and it seems th at the safety record is there Reaction to many of the electricity proposals broke heavily along partisan lines and reflected the two major parties attitudes toward government While Democrats favored creating a public power authority purchasing transmission lines and seizing power plants Republicans were strongly opposed to these ideas But asked about rate caps members of both parties were heavily in favor Republicans favored rate caps percent to percent With Democrats though the gap was twice as wide percent to percent This is one area where the federal government and the Bush administration is exposed to longterm damage here in California said DiCamillo At the same time the pollster said Davis has not made the case for such a large bond issue to alleviate a crisis the majority of Califorians believe has been artificially exacerbated to drive up the profits of energy companies Its a huge bond issue and I think the sheer size of it is dragging it dow n some DiCamillo said I think the cynicism that the public has about the causes of this and why this whole crisis has come to be really prevents the public from supporting this kind of money for this purpose Burton Hertzberg demand FERC puts price caps on electricity DAVID KRAVETS Associated Press Writer Wednesday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Californias Democratic legislative leaders asked a federal appeals panel Tuesday to order federal regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices The people of California need some protection from these outrageous prices said Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg The move by Hertzberg of Van Nuys and Senate President John Burton of San Francisco came after unsuccessful lobbying by Gov Gray Davis and other lawmakers to get the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose strict price caps The citizens of California are suffering immediate irreparable harm as a result of FERCs abrogation of its duty to establish just and reasonable rates for electricity the lawmakers wrote to the th US Circuit Court o f Appeals which has jurisdiction over FERC The lawmakers joined by the city of Oakland said Californias looming threat of continued blackouts are an imminent threat to the health welfar e and safety of every California citizen Theres a danger this entire economy can come unwound warned former governor and now Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown He plans to recruit his fellow mayors to also pressure FERC However Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks questioned whethe r the federal court will intervene in the commissions ongoing regulatory decisions If the court takes it its meritorious If not its political Cox said The suit comes after more than a year of wholesale power prices reaching historically high levels In December prices in California reached pe r megawatt hour and they have skyrocketed to as much as per megawat t hour during peak times since then The Bush administration ardently opposes price caps and President Bush has declined Davis request to urge FERC to impose strict caps Vice President Dick Cheney chief architect of the administrations energy plan released last week said capping prices would not increase energy supplies or reduce demand We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy instead of dealing with the real issues Chene y said Sunday Cheney criticized Davis a Democrat for what he called a harebrained scheme to use the states budget surplus to buy power because Californias two largest utilities face enormous financial problems For the short term the Bush administration has approved Davis request to expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal facilities in California to reduce energy consumption percent this summer Sacramento and the White House appear locked in a highvoltage war of rhetoric over energy policies There is broad bipartisan dissatisfaction in Sacramento with Washingtons response to Californias energy crisis the result of its own deregulation rules Last month FERC did order a oneyear cap on electricity sold into Californi a during power emergencies when power reserves fall below percent The agency did not set a price and also required the state to join a regional transmission organization which could limit Californias ability to contro l its own power grid Davis called the plan a Trojan horse and state power regulators dismisse d the cap as inadequate saying it would profit power generators at ratepayer s expense In addition Davis and state lawmakers sharply criticized FERC for considering requiring the states power grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the states two large financially strapped utilities The case filed Tuesday is Petitioners v Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Associated Press Nuclear powers California

startling shift from views held consistently for more than a generatio n energystrapped Californians now strongly favor nuclear power as a means of providing more electricity a Field Poll shows The statewide poll released today shows that percent of those surveyed support building new nuclear power plants in the state compared with percent who oppose the idea and percent undecided The breakdown is even more dramatic for registered voters who were among th e Californians polled percent in favor and percent opposed wi th percent undecided That represents the first time since a year before the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island that Californians have approved of more nuclear power And it is a complete reversal from the last time Field polle d on the issue in when Californians rejected more nuclear power by a to ratio This is a big deal The states current energy crisis has just set o ff a chain reaction of public support for nuclear power said Mark DiCamillo director of the Field Poll The publics fear of nuclear power is being mitigated by the longterm experience with nuclear power in other states and it is letting down its fears At the same time the poll shows a majority of Californians want air pollution controls to remain in place and reject offshore oil drilling and greater use of coalfired power plants to provide more energy Significantly although once the subject of passionate no nukes protests and controversial initiatives in California nuclear power now has a majori ty of support among Democrats Republicans and independent voters alike the poll showed While Californians gave thumbs up to a power source being pushed by the Bus h administration for the long term they also backed federal price ceilings o n energy a shortterm measure rejected repeatedly by the administration Seven in Californians surveyed say a federal price limit on energy would be a good thing echoing Gov Gray Davis adamant call for such action since the energy crunch became apparent last winter Despite the opposition from Bush and Republican leaders percent of registered Republican voters in California support price limits as do an overwhelming percent of Democrats DiCamillo says the findings clearly dramatize that the consequences of not having federal price caps will be quite severe for the Bush administration as we go into the summer and have blackouts California voters see the price limit proposal as the one way out fo r the state to continue to buy power he said The one proposal the publi c really wants is something that the state itself cannot do It require s the assistance of the federal government The poll underscoring the shifting political landscape created by Californias deepening energy woes came even as Vice President Dick Cheney was making another highprofile plea for more nuclear energy We want to assess the potential for nuclear energy to make a major contribution in terms of improving air quality said Cheney speaking in Washington DC before the Nuclear Energy Institute He called nuclear power a very important part of our energy policy today in the United States The Field Poll findings on nuclear energy were met with enthusiasm by the nuclear industry and harsh criticism from environmentalists Its not surprising said Mitch Singer spokesman for the group that Chen ey addressed yesterday People are seeing an industry running efficiently running safely pumping out a lot of electricity and with no emissions into the atmosphere Whats happening here is the growing consensus and recognition that nuclear energy needs to be part of a diverse portfolio for the country Singer said Californias nuclear power plants in San Onofre and in Diabl o Canyon provide California with percent of its electricity needs at an average production cost of cents per kilowatt hour NUCLEARS TV ADS But Ann Mesnikoff spokeswoman for the national offices of the Sierra Club said voters have been inundated by expensive TV ads by the nuclear industry which fail to mention the dangers When people start seeing truck or rail shipments running through the cente r of the state will they be reminded that nuclear power generates the most dangerous waste substances weve created she asked Nuclear power should not be part of our st century energy plan she sai d Its expensive its slow its dangerous Its not a plan that will provi de California with quicker cleaner and safer energy The Field Poll generally asked for the views of Californians on the propose d solutions to the states energy crunch Among its results Californians surveyed Reject by percent to percent the major solution thus far offered by Davis and the Legislature issuing the sale of up to billion in revenue bonds to help the state purchase power over the next two years CYNICISM ABOUNDS They think its very expensive DiCamillo said Theyre very cynical abo ut why theyre in this energy crisis and they look at this as just a big gaping hole in the states

Monday that showed percent of those polled believe the energy crunch is a big problem Despite the widespread media coverage of the effects of blackouts many Californians said they were not personally

Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews San Francisco Rooftops in San Franciscos sunniest neighborhoods would b e covered with powergenerating solar panels to help ease the citys energy crunch under an ambitious plan proposed by Supervisor Tom Ammiano It is envisioned that at full capacity the project would generate megawatts of electricity enough to power homes which would mak e it the largest such solar program in the nation The project as conceived by Ammiano would be a publicprivate partnership The city would help with financing and private contractors would build and maintain the equipment which would be installed on commercial and residential buildings Ammiano hopes to ask voters in November to approve a Charter amendment that would allow the Board of Supervisors to issue revenue bonds to pay for the project The bond debt would be paid back with money made from the sale of the electricity and lease payments from participating building owners property taxes would not be raised The city would tap into state and feder al subsidies for solar power to bring the costs down Our local dialogue about the energy crisis has been missing a key componen t a commitment to renewable energy that will be directly beneficial to local residences and businesses Ammiano said Monday The project will stake ou t the citys commitment to clean renewable energy The solar power could be used by the buildings on which the equipment is housed with any excess going to the power grid serving the city Its not going to be power in the hands of people who are playing games wi th us It puts power in local control said Rick Shattuc consumer advocate f or The Utility Reform Network a consumer rights group San Francisco Chamber of Commerce vice president Jim Mathias said the idea is intriguing But he wants to see the numbers crunched Financing will be a big challenge Mathias said Economies of scale will help bring down costs but it is unclear if a project focused on the sunny neighborhoods of San Francisco will be big enough in scale to make the numbers work Paul Fenn director of Local Power an Oakland advocacy group helped Ammia no develop the proposal He said the costs could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars Although San Francisco is more famous for its fog than its sunshine Fenn said studies have shown the city has considerable capacity to go solar particularly in neighborhoods on the south side To generate megawatts solar panels equivalent to about football fields would have to be installed on rooftops he said Email Rachel Gordon at San Francisco Chronicle PageA California economy braces for billion electric rate hike Posted at am PDT Wednesday May BY MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP Higher power costs zapped restaurateur Marino Sandova l and his customers even before California regulators decided how to allocate a billion electricity rate hike the highest in state history Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill Sandova l last month raised prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain El Balazo by as much as percent on some items A giant burrito that cost at the end of March costs today We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything from our beans to our tortillas was going up almost every day Our higher prices ha ve everything to do with the higher energy prices said Sandoval who runs s ix restaurants in the San Francisco area From hotels to bagel shops businesses throughout California have been raising prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power costs Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs which utilities have been passing along to customers Now businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the states two bigges t utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The higher rates which will begin appearing in Junes utility bills threaten to jolt the states alreadyjittery economy Pretty soon we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession said Dave Puglia a vice president for APCO a public affairs firm hired by California business interests to study the economic effect of the states energy woes By itself the billion rate increase approved in late March by the California Public Utilities Commission probably isnt enough to topple the states roughly trillion economy the sixth largest in the world After weeks of public hearings and intensive lobbying by various customer groups the commission voted last week how to spread the pain of those rate hikes It will cause some hardships particularly for some small business owners but from the macro point of view these rate increases arent going to have a major impact on Californias output predicted Sung Won Sohn chief economist for Wells Fargo Co which runs the biggest bank headquartered in the state But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline natural gas health care benefits and workers compensation insurance Against this backdrop many employers also face pressure to raise their workers wages to help pay for Californias high housing costs If this keeps up at some point we are going to reach a breaking point i n the economy said Allan Zaremberg president of the California Chamber of Commerce The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and Economic Stability a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricit y rate increase from businesses to households Under the plan approved by the PUC businesses are expected to pay about billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional billion Even if they are spared on their utility bills consumers still will be pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along their electricity price increases The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about percent to percent of a big manufacturers budget Puglia estimated up from about percent now I wouldnt be surprised if we see some companies go out of business becau se of this said Justin Bradley director of energy programs for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Association a hightech trade group Even if they dont shut down completely many companies likely will lay off workers as they cut costs to pay for power The California Manufacturers an d Technology Association estimates the energy crisis will result in the loss of jobs or about more than the entire dotcom industry has laid off nationwide during the past months Painful though they may be most economists say higher electricity rates an d some resulting layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number o f blackouts that probably would have occurred if retail prices hadnt been raised Even though the monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from last year to this year Sandoval said customers continue to pour into his El Balazo restaurants despite higher menu prices Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am going to have to raise my prices again he said If I have to I will I dont think people are going to stop eating because of this Blackouts may come with early warning ISO plan for minute notice also includes projections for the next day May By MARY ANN MILBOURN The Orange County Register The public could get up to minutes warning that rolling blackouts are likely under a plan proposed Monday by the states power grid operator More information also would be available about the days electricity supply and demand as well as a forecast on the likelihood of nextday rolling blackouts The proposals are an effort by the Independent System Operator which operates the power grid to respond to criticism that the six blackouts tha t have occurred so far in California have caused costly disruptions of communities and businesses Problems have ranged from car accidents when traffic signals went blank to lost production caused by computerized equipment suddenly going down The additional lead time would help people prepare for the outages For now however Southern California Edison customers wouldnt be told where the first outages would hit The utility would publicize the locations of subsequent outages Ernie Rodriguez owner of Southern California Plastics in Santa Ana said anything would be helpful Our equipment is very sensitive said Rodriguez whose company custom molds plastic We need to prepare our machines and even minutes would be helpful But the ISOs proposal wasnt enough for some members of the Legislature wh o have advocated prescheduled blackouts Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would require the state Public Utilities Commission to notify businesses an d homeowners of possible blackouts as much as one month ahead of time We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly The ISOs board of governors will consider the early warning system at its meeting Thursday If adopted it could go into effect May and provide ne w more timely information on several fronts When demand is high the ISO would issue forecasts to the news media emergency services and utilities of peak demand supply and weather for the next hours A power watch would be issued when the ISO calls a Stage alert in whic h reserves dip below percent or a Stage alert when the system is within percent of running out of power The ISO would issue a power warning if theres a chance that a Stag e alert in which reserves fall below percent will be called Thirty minutes before a blackout occurs the ISO would issue a notice of probable load interruption If additional supply is found or demand is reduced no blackout would be necessary Steven Conroy a spokesman for Southern California Edison said he hadnt seen the details of the policy but that it appears to work well with his companys plans Edison serves most of Orange County The more information we can provide will be of value to our customers Conroy said Beginning next month Edison customers will get their rotatingoutage group number on their bills Initially Edison will use the group numbers only to let customers know who might be next for blackouts once they start The company will use its Web site a telephone voice recording and broadcast media to get the word out Conroy however said the company is considering posting the group numbers for the first areas to be blacked out Officials have been reluctant to announce where outages will hit for fear of theft and vandalism San Diego Gas Electric which serves customers in south Orange County is already using pagers and email to notify business customers of powergrid conditions Spokesman Ed Van Herick said the ISO warning might give SDGE time to let block groups know where initial blackouts will hit Also Monday the Public Utilities Commission began accepting applications from businesses seeking exemptions from rolling outages Exemptions are only granted to customers who provide essential services su ch as hospitals fire and police stations and air traffic control facilities The PUC will consider exemptions for businesses whose shutdown would constitute a threat to public health and safety The deadline to apply is June A decision on which businesses qualify for exemptions is expected by Aug As part of the statewide effort to gear up for the expected summer blackout s the California Energy Commission on Thursday will test a new computer syste m that notifies cities counties special districts and some federal agencies in the state about energy conditions The goal of the system is conservation said Mara Bouvier commission contingency planning coordinator The messages sent via telephone and email will detail energy forecasts and ask that agencies reduce power use About cities counties special districts and federal agencies have signed up for the statewide program to determine how much power could be conserved during a Stage emergency Were going to see if theres notable conservation there Bouvier said Bouvier characterized the effort as a civic duty by agencies to show the governor how the state will do what they can to conserve energy Controller questions electricity cost Connell says state might have to issue bonds but Davis says state is meeti ng goals May The Associated Press SACRAMENTO Controller Kathleen Connell on Monday questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheaply enough to avoid borrowing more tha n the billion bond sale already approved by state lawmakers Connell said the state will need to issue an additional billion to billion in shortterm debt this summer or risk running out of money this fa ll until the longterm bond can be issued to repay the state treasury The increased amount could further stress the states declining credit rating forcing higher interest rates for new borrowing Meanwhile the state auditor released a report saying previous estimates th at the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic The Bure au of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission saying the commission hasnt responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line projects The audit said the PUC contributes to delays by failing to work closely wit h other agencies and in its decisionmaking relies too heavily on information supplied by the investorowned utilities Auditors asked by lawmakers to review the states energy regulators also said the California Energy Commissions extensive licensing methods slowed down plant approvals Of a dozen power plants licensed since only fou r were completed within the month rule thus slowing the states ability t o satisfy its electricity needs auditors said Gov Gray Davis energy advisers said Monday that the state is meeting its energy goals despite doubts raised by Connell and other critics Davis experts said their estimates are conservative though they rely heavily on Californians cutting back on their energy use this summer to hel p drive down prices The estimates assume the states consumers and businesses cut total electricity use percent and the state already is hitting that projection said chief energy adviser S David Freeman That just knocks the stuffing out of the demand Freeman said driving do wn prices as well A percent reduction in energy use saves the state far more than percent on its power purchases Freeman explained Thats because it comes straight out of the states purchases on the spot power market where electricity is far more expensive than power bought under longterm contracts Spot prices have dropped dramatically the past two weeks said Davis financial adviser Joseph Fichera The state has paid well under per megawatt hour during offpeak period s the past two weeks administration officials said at a news conference Fichera said that should help cut the average price to near the per megawatt hour average Davis plan assumes The officials refused to give specific price information or give the current average price Davis earlier said the state has paid as much as per megawatt hours during times o f peak demand In addition today the state will send Connell seven new power generation contracts that will help boost supply this summer Fichera said The state has in place contracts covering percent of the power the state needs to buy this month percent of next months power needs percent in July and percent in August Fichera said He said Davis energy experts also have been accurate in predicting the amount of the states power purchases despite Connells doubts In April they predicted the state would spend billion but actually spent billion a percent variance he said He said this months predictions so far are proving accurate as well Connell also said she will use her post on the states Board of Equalizatio n to host a hearing next month on whether generators should pay more property taxes because the value of their power plants has increased with soaring electricity prices Rate increase to hit harder than thought May By CHRISTOPHER MARTIN Bloomberg News SAN FRANCISCO Californias billion electricity price increase will affect more homes than expected because regulators used conflicting and outdated data in estimates utilities and regulatory officials say The California Public Utilities Commission voted last week to raise rates for customers of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Ediso n while sparing residential consumers who limit electricity use Gov Gray Davis and other state officials said half of residential customers would no t pay higher prices But PGE Californias largest utility said only about percent of residential customers or million homes will escape higher rates Edis on said percent of its residential customers will avoid the increase I believe there are a lot more residential consumers facing higher rates than the order shows said Commissioner Richard Bilas who voted against t he rate increase The PUC said half of all residential customers would be exempt from higher power prices Its analysis focused on electricity sales to homes rather th an the number of customers Under the PUCs method percent of Edison residential sales and percent of PGE sales would be exempt from rate increases Carl Wood a Davis appointee to the PUC who voted in favor of the increase said the commissions estimates will probably prove to be wrong Its very likely that more than half of residential consumers will see an increase especially this summer Wood said Energy Shortages Price Caps and Windfall Profit Taxes Lessons Never Learne d WASHINGTONBUSINESS WIREMay via NewsEdge Corporation By Craig G Goodman President of the National Energy Marketers Association and former Director of Oil and Energy Tax Policy in the Reagan and Bush Administrations In the last year we have experienced an energy crisis in California unprecedented prices for natural gas and high oil prices on top of six interest rate increases and four trillion dollars of lost wealth in the stock market History has taught us many lessons about energy policy particularly about making new laws and regulations in response to a crisis One thing our country indeed the global economy cannot afford is to repeat the energy policy mistakes of our past During the Oil Embargo of the s OPEC withheld oil supplies for a short time as a political gesture causing an oil price spike In response the US instituted the most complex scheme of energy price and allocation controls since World War II Energy price caps and their aftermath caused more than ten years of economic stagflation rising oil imports historic trade deficits massive wealth transfers in petrodollars to OPEC nations gasoline lines unprecedented interest rates and declining US energy production At the very time we needed more US energy supplies our energy price caps permitted oil produced everywhere else in the world to sell on world markets for as high as per barrel while US producers were forced to accept per barrel Once prices were deregulated prices fell to a low of per barrel yet at the same time the government taxed away approximately billion in capital needed to develop new energy supplies under the name of Windfall Profit Taxes As a result today we are nearly twice as dependent on imported oil than when the Embargo began Politicians live for the next election corporations live for the next quarters earnings and most of the rest of us live from paycheck to paycheck So how do we deal with the immediate political and the financial pain of energy price spikes shortages blackouts environmental sensitivities and its disproportionate impact on the poorest Americans Price Caps and Windfall taxes are political salves that feels good today and hurt tomorrow These are bad policies that sound great help politicians get elected and hurts the average consumer after the next election Are there any choices Must we repeat the failed policies of the s that ruined our economy for a decade No we dont There are quick effective and low cost policies to deal with our energy crisis Indeed there are numerous energy policy options that can yield very significant short and longterm paybacks to US Society Electricity represents the last vestige of years of the most complicated price and allocation controls known to man The retail US energy business is one of the largest single businesses in the world It represents nearly a trillion dollars a year of which energy is only about billion Currently however utility bills include all manner of products services information and technologies which are truly separate and very competitive businesses In the US there are very few true supply monopolies or demand monopsonies But between competitive sources of supply and demand there are two fullblown government sanctioned monopolies One is an interstate transmission monopoly and one is a local distribution monopoly Current rules governing these monopolies are incredibly complex hard to audit and impose enormously unnecessary costs on consumers in many different ways To help consumers and lower energy prices quickly monopoly barriers to new energy supplies must be repealed and aggressive conservation and load reduction incentives must be implemented immediately At the same time both state and federal policies must squeeze the monopoly profits out of the two monopolies between supply and demand so that more competitive supplies can meet demand at lower prices States must also stop granting utilities a monopoly or competitive advantages to provide competitive products services information and technologies Utilities should perform solely natural monopoly functions Regulated utilities should sell transportation services on a no frills cost of service basis Needed infrastructure investments should be given targeted performancebased incentives Regulations tariff structures interconnection rules back up rates and operational protocols should be uniform and designed to permit competitive suppliers to provide all other energyrelated products services information and technologies at competitive not monopoly prices Today we are witnessing the largest industrial restructuring in the history of this country possibly the world Every other industry that has deregulated has experienced to percent savings The US market for energy and related products services information and technology is nearly a trillion dollars a year Even a percent saving can save consumers as much as billion a year every year in

shown mercy by detractors spanning the political spectrum But scant suggestions within th e Vice President Dick Cheneyoverseen tome have generated the opposition than has the call to extend the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC authority to acquire at a fair price private land for the public good to include transmission lines Why not transmission Dwight D Eisenhower used eminent domain with the nations interstate highw ay system and it has been used to expand the countrys natural gas pipeline system BushCheney say why not transmission lines The clash between the common good and individual rightsapparent since t he United States was foundedis moving into the power sector industry watc hers say And good or bad right or wrong may have little to do with whether or not the president can indeed bestow eminent domain concerning transmission lines on FERC There is a very strong case to be made for the use of eminent domain here but politically it clashes with property rights and states rights advocates said Pietro Novola senior fellow governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC A sleeping disaster Few people who comprehend that electricity is more than flipping a switch doubt the need for more transmission capacity But companies involved in trying to site new wires know its easier to construct a new power plant th an build transmission NIMBYism not in my backyard is in full bloom when it comes to new transmissionjust ask American Electric Power about its Wes t VirginiaVirginia decadelong fight to construct a new transmission line This is a sleeping disaster said Jonathan Gottlieb partner in the North American Energy and Utility Products Group at Baker McKenzie in Washingto n DC and former FERC attorney Granted you need additional supply you need conservation but you have a transmission system that is not connected and which cannot support demand The presidents energy policy report found that investment in new transmission between and had fallen to million from more th an billion In addition over the next decade only miles of new transmission are to be added to the gridjust of the existing miles of wire There is a very strong case to be made for the use of eminent domain here but politically it clashes with property rights and states rights advocates From the economics side this idea eminent domain makes sense said Cra ig Pirrong finance professor at the Olin School of Business at Washington University St Louis It makes sense but its not necessarily going to happen Coalitions of groups that normally would cross to the other side of the street to avoid each other suddenly are locking arms and singing Kumbaya Pirrong said there are three groups that certainly will look with disdain a t giving FERC the power to seize These are vertically integrated utilities state public utility commissions and environmentalists One could add to th at trio conservative western Republicansmembers of Bushs own partywho never have liked taking orders from those faraway Easterners Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an encroachment on their territories Pirrong said Its similar to the Baby Bell telephone companies opening the last mile of their service territorie s to competition has been extremely difficult The state commissions generall y are very responsive to the local utilities and of course you have the environmental interests NARUC is troubled The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners NARUC has registered its concern regarding expanded eminent domain power for FERC We are very troubled with the Presidents position said Chris Mele NARUCs legislative director Weve consistently held that the siting of transmission or generation belongs with the states We are adequately equipped to do it and all the infrastructure there we put in place But all that infrastructure was built prederegulation when each little utility constructed its state and federallyapproved monopolyfiefdom and lived in peaceful coexistence with its neighboring utility Those days excluding the effects of the California debacleare over in about half t he states with the remainder eventually to follow the same deregulation path Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an encroachme nt on their territories Proponents say just as the development of the automobile led to the need fo r an interconnected interstate highway system the movement toward deregulati on in the power industry is leading the country toward a true interconnected transmission system Gas considered national security issue And just as was the case when Ike conceived and started the ball rolling concerning the interstate highway system private property also has been seized for energyrelated projects Baker McKenzies Gottlieb pointed out that the development beginning in the s of the nations interstate pipeline system was looked at from the broader perspective of national security Transmission developed as a local function with a disconnected system Gottlieb said Just having eminent domain in its quiver of powers makes it easier for FERC to site pipelines the threat of its use is a powerful stimulus Washington Universitys Pirrong said Many industry watchers point to the greater good scenario If a new transmission line is needed for the greater good of many then the federal government should have the power to move things off center away from the parochial If you need interstate power the companies involved cannot buy the property and the project is for the greater good then sometimes the government has to use eminent domain said Jake Haulk an economist and managing director of the conservative think tank Allegheny Institute for Public Policy in Pittsburgh Pa We wouldnt think twice about taking property for an interstate highway Someone has to be able to step in to override purely local parochial feelings said Jerry Pfeffer energy industries advisor in the Washington DC office of the law firm Skadden Arps All politics is local While the political rhetoric heats up industry watchers say it all depends on which way the western Republican delegations fall inor out oflin e behind Bush Its a real test of Tip ONeils famous saying that all politics is local according to Pfeffer If the western Republicans vote as their constituent s wish they will vote against giving eminent domain power to FERC Or will they bite hard and vote with their president for that authority Its a classic case of local vs presidential politics

Californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday The backup generators will help us get through the summer said S David Freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis drive for energy conservation Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan The governor will announce what hes going to do he said Wednesday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with The Bee Roger Salazar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm whe n or whether Davis would make such an announcement I dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that Salazar said Under the plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators an d simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted The state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation Deploying dieselpowered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggl e to get more megawatts flowing through California Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power tha t will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts A megawatt is enough power for to households The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis administrations policy The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that routine use of the backup diesel s would endanger public health San Diego Gas Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today b y the Davisappointed state Public Utilities Commission Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis A letter signed Wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the American Lung Association of California urged Davis to reconsider Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states Freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemergen cy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages This is a nobrainer Freeman said Youve got human lives at stake here This is a scary situation Freeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go aw ry in blackouts But Sandra Spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League countered If the health impacts are so marginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed this Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locomotives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power Unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most generators in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming nitrogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant according to air board engineers Further the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say Davis plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a Stage alert meaning the power supplies are running l ow and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsing according to Freeman Salazar the governors spokesman said only Any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have th e state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity Freem an would not confirm the pay rate The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules For operators of existing power plants the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om

electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coas t wholesale electricity prices Details for the BushDavis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday b ut the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the White

repeated pleas fro m the Democratic congressional delegation Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers an d a handful of Republicans but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort state In recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on Capitol Hill Bushs two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whose names were forwarded to the Senate floo r Wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls once they a re seated on the panel And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate moving Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico a pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the k ey Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee California Sen Dianne Feinstein a committee Democrat said Wednesday that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of pricecontrol legislation On Wednesday Rep Doug Ose RSacramento announced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price reli ef for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer Ose chairman of the House Government Reform Committees energy subcommitte e said his bill would extend throughout the West a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the FERC But instead of that plan taking effect onl y during power emergencies as the commission directed it would operate aroun d the clock under Oses bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of the leastefficient plant selling into the California market Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through longterm contracts rather than on the volatile spot market I am looking for a middle ground Ose said The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Energy Digest GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published May State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to Gov Gray Davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesdays split was necessary because there are few differences between the governors plan and the Democrats plan The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow Edison to pay off billion in debts In return

Bureau Chief Published May Utility companies and outofstate power generators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californias energy crisis but Gov Gray Davis grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months according to a Field Poll released Wednesday And Californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states powe r woes except themselves Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve ry good job to improve the energy situation Only percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job Public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since January when percent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high marks The public sees themselves as conserving energy said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo Thats the only positive movement in the survey For Davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from positive In the January poll the Democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor ratings from only percent But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May and Sunday opinions about Davis flipflopped After months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think Davis is doing a good job while percent gave him failing grades The po ll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin g over well any more DiCamillo said The public is starting to view this a s a longterm problem not some temporary policy shift Still Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis Preside nt Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry The publics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in January dro ps even lower in the May poll Utility companies received bad ratings from hal f the public in January but percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job Outofstate energy generators whom Davis has accused of gouging ratepayers fell from percent low ratings in January to perce nt in the May poll Bush the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utiliti es Commission are not far behind drawing poor grades from more than half the public Cheney the architect of Bushs energy proposal received low ratin gs from percent The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called Cheney grossly misinformed on the states energy problems Cheney in turn has called Davis energy proposals harebrained and goofy The state Legislature receives poor marks from percent of those polled while only percent believe it is doing a good job The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or New views emerging on power More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The Bees John Hill can be reached at or Californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol l Related graphic By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a percent to percent margin Californians desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch respondents said By a margin of percent to percent poll respondents say they would maintain airquality standards rather than relax them to build plants That support is down from a Field survey in January when percent said theyd rather maintain standards Moreover a majority percent say they would relax airquality standards to get older plants back in operation an increase from percent in January Slight majorities support a staterun public power authority percent a nd stateowned power transmission lines percent but DiCamillo said that some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines with Democrats in favor percent to percent and Republicans opposed percent to percent Overall the idea was rejected by percent of adults and favored by percent A strong majority of registered voters percent oppose additional offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch and percent fav or it The

week during a twoday visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov Gray Davis White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the states energy crisis will be at the top of the list when the president a nd the governor meet The presidents aides said that the time and place for t he meeting are still being worked out Bushs visit to the state will be his first since last falls campaign Wit h their party enjoying only a slim majority in the US House some Californi a Republicans have expressed dismay over their states absence from the presidents extensive postinaugural travel schedule fearing that the ener gy crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next years elections Fleischers announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to California However Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicke r action on the energy front Californians cant afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution We need relief today In the longer of two letters Davis wrote You and I dont agree on everything But heres something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up Davis also offered in the letters to introduce Bush to business owners a nd everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with business leaders and energy consumers Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis Fleischer suggested the presidents schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis suggestions This is a case of they both want to meet with each other and were very pleased to be able to make it work out he said As for the meeting with the business leaders Fleischer said The presiden t has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders an d energy consumers and so it very well may happen that were each suggesting similar things which would be a healthy sign Bushs itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Mari ne Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut the ir energy use by percent at California facilities Fleischer said that the president wanted to talk about how the federal government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in th e cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at risk The White House released an outline of the presidents California itinerary on Tuesday afternoon It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to the states energy woes Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while in California Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the electricity shortages toll on the state and its citizens They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before t he House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the state The administration and most of the states Republican lawmakers oppo se the measure Last week Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation s energy challenges that stressed longrange solutions focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear powe r The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and greater fuel efficiency Bushs trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to

try again this week to legislat e price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state Rep Henry Waxman a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the pricecap measure said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday At th at time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bi ll designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summ er due to shortages in the supply of electrical power Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fundraising events on Mond ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws Waxman said It is a contrived crisis in order to produce percent increases in profits for some of these generators On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep Joe Barton RTexas that would allow California Gov Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent It also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities Earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxmans pricecap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve Californias crisis The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production Waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit At the press conference Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego derided Republican opposition to price caps Referring to wholesale power generators Filner argued They were making money at a megawatt now they are charging up to Believe me Th ey can make money off the

Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico wont s et any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the border Since theres a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ ia for electricity anyone who requests a permit will get it Martens said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas th annual Latin American Energy Conference in La Jolla Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most immediate solutions to Californias electricity shortfalls At least three plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blackouts have interrupted normal activity One facility a Sempra Energy Corp power plant near Mexicali will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border The San Dieg o companys project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th e facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican market Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety In his speech Martens emphasized Mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities But afterward he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve California consumers I dont see any limit The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin g lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he said With a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja California will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California plants let alone any additional facilities Sempra whose San Diego Gas Electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday The improvement will transmit electricity from Sempras plant in Baja California to the company substatio n in Imperial Valley The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana Clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building Baja California plants plan to transmit their electricity Representatives of the firms cou ld not be reached yesterday Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border the California grid system presents another obstacle To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo r transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic e Its become very important because of our proximity to Mexico said district spokesman Ron Hull The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja California Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities Sempra again is a key player in this area It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego The pipeline wont provide fuel for any other facilities Its fully subscribed said Clark In the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased Energy Secretary Martens however hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in Baja California He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation Martens comments were the first to indicate that two and not one might b e approved for Baja California Potential governor candidate launches Northern

what will be coming down the pike As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kicked out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected during the termlimit era A statewide initiative brave candidates ending term limits those are a ll things that will happen in the future Right now its time to tune in turn off and drop out Tune in to

Independent System Operator managers of the states electrical grid proposed earlier this week The ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today Details of Davis plan were still being worked out said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity But any plan would have to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts Davis also hopes to give hour and then hour notices of probable blackout scenarios Administration officials said the twoday notice would go to law enforcement while everyone would get a hour warning Business groups welcomed the executive order We need to plan we need to make adjustments in business schedules said Jeanne Cain vice president for government relations for the California Chamber of Commerce There are concerns about employee safety issues The more notice we have the better we can accommodate the blackout Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and working with the governor Sixty minutes is twice as good as minutes he said With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses As much notice as possible would be helpful Its helpful to have some advance notice for planning purposes but small businesses will still be hu rt by the blackouts said Shirley Knight assistant state director of the National Federation of Independent Business Most small businesses are in the service sector so theyre open during the day which means smallbusiness owners arent going to be able to recoup those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to Knight said But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackout s from happening in the first place Its like saying youre going to know a half hour earlier that an earthqua ke is coming said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy generators rather than giving us an extra minutes POWER WATCH The Independent System Operators proposed plan for forecasting potential blackouts envisions a system that would provide a hour notice of high demand days A Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage or Stage alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a percent chance of a Stage alert when electricity reserves dro p below percent Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning of blackouts saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it would welcome the advance notice to be able to notify customers who rely on electricity for lifecritical equipmen t and large businesses We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to customers about pending rotating outages said Ron Low a spokesman for PGE The public safety aspect must be taken into account said one consumer grou p Blackouts have serious consequences not just economic said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco They create public safety hazards and all of those issues cannot be addressed from warnings But knowing in advance is better EMAIL ALERTS The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much i s available It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly email This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Heres some advice from PGE a nd local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if your home alo ne is affected It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PGE or your city electrical bureau Unplug or turn off all appliances TVs and computers Leave one light on to warn you when the power comes back on When the power returns turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power surges Dont plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can sen d a highvoltage current through the system that can electrocute power worker s Dont open your refrigerator so your food will remain cold Tell children who are home alone to remain calm turn off the TV and computers and not to use candles Chronicle staff writer Greg Lucas contributed to this

energy doghouse a Field Poll shows The states power companies outofstate energy providers President Bush and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey Davis ratings have gone down but a lot of others are given lower ratings when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are handling the states energy situation said Mark DiCamillo director of the Field Poll Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating s skidding for anyone connected with the energy business Everyone has gotten tarred DiCamillo said A solid percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric Co and the states other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve ry poor job with the energy problem with outofstate power providers ranked almost as low But percent also put Bushs efforts in the poorvery poor category and percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to the same level The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked with the presidents refusal to back limits on energy prices which are supported by a wide range of California residents DiCamillo said To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue he said I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect the blame for Californias energy woes from his office but there are indications that that strategy may not work forever Although percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job with the

effort to conserve DiCamillo said In th e publics eye its everyone else that is not doing what they should be doing The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousne ss of the energy crunch More than percent believe it will be a year or mor e before the energy crisis is resolved and more than half are convinced it will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a long haul DiCamillo said The state hasnt been able to fix the problem in a hurry and people dont believe its going to happen The survey also showed that nearly half the states residents believe that PGEs bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to its customers while percent say it

from a proposal being considered by Gov Gray Davis that would pa y owners of backup generators to produce electricity The proposal one of several options the governor is considering would pay for diesel power which at its dirtiest is times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants when electricity supplies are stretched If backup generators were to be used it would only be as a last resort t o avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we are in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators That would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garve y executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its on e thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electr ic grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the

Oildale Energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge Th e clamor of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone Employees have painted Oildales machinery insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless ton turbine Now they wait Its kind of like a skeleton says plant manager Mike Pankratz surveyi ng the octopustangle of pipes and tanks Choked by the million Pacific Gas Electric Co owes it Oildale shut down Feb taking its megawatts of badly needed electricity with it T he hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most seriou s issues of Californias energy crisis one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plants battling Californias utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them These small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of Californias electricity At least have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills Four ha ve sued PGE And PGEs bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least small generators including Oildale In many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with th e utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market What this is basically is the revolt of the mice said Bill Short wit h Ridgewood Power Management a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in California and sued PGE Officials to weigh debt The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities Commission which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilitie s to pay the back debt Meanwhile US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from PGE The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately small generator s threatens Californias fragile power supply just as the state heads into th e summer months up to megawatts short The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of Californias energy crunc h add up daily In Oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of more than employees at the refinery next door Its one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue California is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in it s own back yard they say Gasfired cogeneration plants which provide powe r to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities are some of the mos t efficient producers in the state And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced natural gas The idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else this is jus t nuts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state This is really a major blunder The immediate crisis started in late January Oildales Pankratz explained Thats when PGE told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in December The news worried Oildales gas supplier Pankratz said which halted the plants supply Pankratz turned off the plants turbine The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties the refinery that looms over Oildale Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces Golden Bear filed for bankruptcy April Last week it announced plans to lay off employees Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale Golden Bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago Having it go under was gutwrenching he said Power unavailable The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrici ty grid reports that megawatts of power from small generators are off line It estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both Others say financial problems have megawatts off line Lawmakers havent been much help The state Assembly on March rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies The iss ue has languished in Sacramento Days later the utilities commission ordered Californias utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty backdue amount s It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity That price is percent lower and too low for business some argue The commissions position has been that the small generators should abide b y their existing contracts said commission attorney Gary Cohen To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critic s Its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying How long can you hold up until the ship comes said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts c an resolve the issue Were in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship said Shor t with Ridgewood the independent generator that has sued PGE Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their contracts Five have lost their fights Another five have won the right to put a lien on Edisons assets In PGEs battle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy In the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy As for Oildale it wants PGE to pay the million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market It also wants PGE to pay what it calls a fair market value for its electricity If Oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forced into bankruptcy its attorneys argue Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months PGE is fighting to keep its small generators which it says are exaggerati ng their damage It reports that only a tiny fraction of its generators ar e off line Increased costs If the plants were released from their contracts PGE could not afford to pay the extra million per month it estimates electricity would cost T he state Department of Water Resources and ultimately ratepayers would have to foot that bill A fast solution isnt likely from the bankruptcy court The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions Meanwhile the clock ticks Weve all been a little tense says Judy Andreatta who has worked Oildales front desk for years and worries about her job Its just so scary watching everything happen Whod ever think wed lose power Electricity notebook FERC may renew price caps May From Register wire services Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year The price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation This proposed action said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif could make a real difference Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap the price of natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than t he rest of the nation said Feinstein Currently she said the price in Southern California is per million British Thermal Units and only in the rest of the Western region Gas fuels most electricitygenerating plants in the state The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to California or include other Western markets Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison Davis tack is politically volatile The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy May By HANH KIM QUACH and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov Gray Davis made to rescue the states No utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable Davis deal some have complained is sweeter for Southern California Ediso n than for taxpayers So at least four proposals are being floated to supplan t that plan But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them Plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddli ng could result in what neither side wants bankruptcy for Edison Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison a nd Pacific Gas Electric which is already in bankruptcy complete the Chapter process which could take years experts and lawmakers said The states wallet would shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said Bria n Bennett vice president of Edison International the utilitys parent company Southern California Edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan which calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission gri d for billion Company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it Bennett said Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal Edison is going to survive said Mitch Wilk a member of the state Publi c Utilities Commission from through and a past president of the agency But the question is whether it will survive via the plan that th e governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PGE did There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly Wilk said PGE chose to file Chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with t he progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company PGE s move was an embarrassment for Davis who had vowed to keep the states big utilities solvent One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said Ed Feo a lawyer involved with the PGE case It would be a black eye for the state As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade Edisons creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of June Dean Vanech president of New Jerseybased Carson Cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edis on into bankruptcy In general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made Vanech said But he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timeMeanwhile Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal The company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said John Bryson chief executive of Edison International Bankruptcy is a last resort Bryson said in a recent interview We believe there will be a solution But changes are necessary said Senate Leader John Burton DSan Francisco because people didnt like Plan A Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan which many thought was over ly generous to Edison limiting investigation of the utilitys parents compan y and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment Alternatives include requiring power generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billion theyre owed taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing Edison to bui ld more power plants The latest proposal would require the state to sell bond s to pay off Edisons debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later Most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts One hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house behind one plan necessary any time the state spends money Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders Sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court Bankruptcies are messy but so is the political process Sweeney said Were in a situation where the leadership politically seems not willing to bite the bullet It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office Long Beach obtains lien on Edisons assets The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ Poll in state favor nuclear power Its a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident May The Associated Press Fiftynine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants according to a poll released Wednesday The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy was five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvan ia and it found percent opposed to nuclear power In my interpretation the current energy crisis has some bearing on the publics changed attitudes on nuclear power said Mark DiCamillo spokesma n for the nonpartisan polling organization The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look a t nuclear power No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in th e United States since The poll of California adults was taken May The margin of erro r was plus or minus percent Carl Zichella the Sierra Clubs regional staff director said Californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about years and do not have as much information as they did around Three Mile Island I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground he said The more people know about nuclear power the less theyre going to like it Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems

Franciscobased Bechtel Enterprises Holdin gs Inc today filed an Application For Certification AFC with the California Energy Commission CEC for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in Hayward Calif The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in California The filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at Enterprise Avenue in Hayward The site is adjacent to the city of Haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center Th e Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the Bay Area The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said Curt Hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the CalpineBechtel Joint Development We look forward to working with the City of Hayward Alameda County and the California Energy Commission to develop a model Energy Center Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of extensive engineering technical and environmental studies We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process Hildebrand added We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we can to help solve the states energy crisis as quickly as possible Once the CEC determines that the application is complete and determine whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process the officia l review will begin As lead agency the CEC will work with environmental an d government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and hearings to encourage community participation The expedited review process would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer review period Based upon the successful licensing of the project construction could begin in summer of with commercial operation by summer of Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and

May Xinhua via COMTEX Governor of California Gra y Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving construction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage California is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove California The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas storage project in Lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling The crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers And the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax money so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them Among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has called for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayResidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer From the Oakland Tribune Lockyer Probe may spark suit Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his investigation of alleged multibilliondollar price gouging by power generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could w in huge refunds But the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power company officials being locked up with my tattooed dude Lockyer a former East Bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal I would love to personally escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Houstonbased Enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the California market It dismissed Lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration Other power companies have expressed outrage I was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators Lockyer said I decided to make the point with the energy generators that theyve got a serious fight on their hands The attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever since because Im a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about thes e sorts of accusations or claims But I know it wont be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said We dont care if theyre multimillionaires We dont care if they run big corporations Theyre buccaneers Theyre ripping us off Now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or illegal greed its clearly immoral Theres no debate about that Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the streng th of the states case I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said A civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said The California Independent System Operator which manages the states electric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by billion since early last year The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agencys ongoing probe Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe Theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation Lockyer said The attorney generals comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by California officials against power suppliers as well as ongoing probes Besides the attorney and FERC the Legislature state Public Utilities Commission CalISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all conducting investigations by MediaNews Group Inc and ANG Newspapers

Warnings of Blackouts SF The Examiner Fri Legislature hangs Davis out to dry By Nick Driver Of The Examiner Staff Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov Gray Davis plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with one of their own The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San Diegoarea utility and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase PGE lines through bankruptcy proceedings And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his own transmission line deal A week ago Davis finally found a termlimited senator Richard Polanco DLos Angeles to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso n lines Now the governors office admits that talks will not proceed until the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edisons lines Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi s plan giving the state a fiveyear option to purchase all power lines for billion While a much lower price the bill would also lower Edisons debt by forcing power marketers to accept percent of the billion ow ed them Under the terms of that proposal the state would still have to loan Edison money around billion and would guarantee SoCal Edisons sale of a further billion in bonds The state would also receive a conservation easement on acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land As in the Davis bill SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively lowcost electricity for years from one of its power plants and force parent company Edison International to repay million in transfers A Republican plan labeled Plan R now making its way through the halls of the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister except it allows the state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build The Democratic bills sponsors Assemblymen John Dutra DFremont Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg believe they can persuade Edisons board of directors to approve their deal even though it is not as attractive as the governors offer Edison refused to comment on the plan Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge were trying a different strategy Wednesday The minority partys Plan R has not been introduced as official legislation but instead floated among Republicans a nd Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edisons only real alternative to bankruptcy and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern neighbor PGE in bankruptcy So far Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators charging high wholesale prices PGE declared bankruptcy April A governors office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all attention away from any dealmaking but that the two sides continued to me et frequently Another adviser Joe Fichera said there are lots of moving parts to the deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electrics transmission lines bu t that he continued to meet with company representatives including an allda y meeting Monday In San Diego a spokesman for SDGE referred all calls to t he governors office But the sponsor of the Davis bill Polanco is not one of the legislatures power brokers and most lawmakers said the billion memorandum of understanding is now in serious jeopardy A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos including the threat of an increase in blackouts The governor and business leaders have said the economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages rises Legislators policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne ed and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the state especially if the bulk of them now owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co are still not for sale Critics such as Senate President John Burton DSan Francisco one of the bills strongest proponents three months ago now say the state should not be in the business of replacing or upgrading dilapidated lines at a cost of upwards of billion Others see the state as the best candidate for improving a system long neglected by utilities State ownership of the transmission grid would be a better way to help gri d problems such as connecting wind generators said Joe Ito an energy analy st at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories It has been extremely difficult to buil d new transmission capacity over the last years especially into bottlenec ks like San Francisco Bush unveiled his Energy Plan last week including a key plank that would allow the federal government to use eminent domain to purchase private land and build more transmission lines Bush arrives Tuesday for talks with Davi s on this and other solutions to the energy

Davis plan calls for a hour notice that power blackouts are likely to occur a hour notice that certain neighborhoods will probably be hit and a onehour notice to those neighborhoods that the lights

reached at or For seniors the heat can kill doctors warn By Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert Bee Staff Writers Published May As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a countertheme Heat can kill And most often it kills seniors Year after year heat waves around the United States are deadlier than hurricanes or floods tornadoes or earthquakes according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration In California a single Los Angeles heat wave killed more than twice as man y people as the San Francisco quake according to research assembled by the state Energy Commission And national weather disaster statistics show that more than twothirds of those felled by the heat in recent years were age or older Heat and the elderly are not a good combination said Dr Cheryl Phillips a Sutter Medical Group geriatrician Its a real concern this year As people age their bodies begin to lose the ability to sense when they ar e thirsty or to bounce back quickly from dehydration she said The very people who are most vulnerable to heat also often have a tradition of thrift and public spiritedness that might lead them to use less electricity than is safe doctors and energy officials fear Their conservation ethic was from the s and s when we didnt have a ir conditioning as prevalent as we do now and they were much younger So they probably feel like I can do this this is important and theyre not recognizing the change in their body said Claudia Chandler of the Energy Commission The California Department of Aging is concerned enough that it will soon begin a special outreach to warn seniors about the dangers of hot temperatures especially when air conditioning may be low or turned off because of high utility bills In a public education campaign aimed at the million Californians who ar e or older officials will preach conservation preparedness for outages a nd the need for drinking eight glasses of water each day Relatively simple steps can keep people safe if they are alert to the danger Some are as obvious as staying out of the sun and moving less on the hottes t days Others are more arcane People of all ages need to be aware that certain medications including some antidepressants and diuretics can increase their sensitivity to heat So can too much alcohol too much weight heart disease and other illnesses Allergies and heart problems underscore Margueritte Ranneys juggling act At she has already had to refinance her house to keep up with rising bills on a fixed income She does her laundry with cold water shuts off unneeded appliances and opens the door each morning to cool her home But when the days heat builds Ranney faces a stark choice Its very ve ry rough she said but she puts her health first She closes up her twobedroom home and turns on her evaporative cooler If I had to turn off my cooler it would be pretty bad she said If I ha ve to turn it off I have problems People who want to cut back on air conditioning while still protecting thei r health should use portable fans at home spray themselves with small mister s and take cool breaks to an air conditioned movie theater or store And seniors especially should drink lots of water Dont wait until you re thirsty Drink constantly on hot days said Phillips Two heatmoderating mechanisms weaken with age she said and doctors still dont understand precisely why In some ways the human body is like a glass of salty water Sweat makes th e water level drop and the salt level rise and in young people two hormones aldosterone and angiotensin kick in to restore the balance Those hormones are the ones that signal to the brain dang Im thirsty said Phillips They also tell the kidneys to hold onto water But as people age their sensitivity to both hormones declines making it easier for seniors to get seriously dehydrated Then things can get even more dangerous because older bodies dont recover as quickly from dehydration The dizziness and confusion that come in later stages of overheating can trigger bonebreaking falls in a person who is already frail The good news is there isnt much danger of getting overheated during rolling blackouts or by setting a thermostat at degrees instead of said Phillips Im really not so worried about the power outages For an hour and a half people will do fine the doctor said Im worried about the power bills Elders on fixed incomes who have to decide between food and the power bill will say heck Im turning the air conditioner off Its a serious worry according to Gloria Jackson of Sacramento Countys Department of Health and Human Services About three or four seniors contact her each week because they are facing a cutoff of their utilities for unpaid bills said Jackson the countys liaison to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Struggling to pay high energy bills on Social Security or other fixed incomes the seniors end up owing from to in overdue bills she said A few have voluntarily had their PGE gas service disconnected so the y will have enough to pay SMUD for electricity With incomes of about a month seniors may pay rent of to an d then have to figure out how to pay for utilities prescriptions and food Some of them are borrowing money to pay their utilities Jackson said Others have pawned jewelry Im very worried about the coming summer Jackson said Barbara Gillogly coordinator of gerontology programs at American River College encouraged neighbors and relatives to check regularly on older people who are living alone especially when temperatures are high And relatives need to be alert to the illnesses and medications that can ma ke seniors especially vulnerable to heat Chandler who cared for her aging father while he had Alzheimers and was taking medications including an antidepressant still remembers the summe r day nearly a decade ago that brought that lesson home to her I came home and he was in an incredibly stressed state she recalled H e was beet red his skin was fiery to touch and his eyes had started to glaze over The temperature of about degrees had been enough to nearly overcome her father and Chandler had to help him into a wading pool to bring his body temperature down It was really scary I almost lost my dad that day she said The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or House panel debates energy price controls By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau Published May WASHINGTON The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans staunch opposition to price controls An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned contentious and was defeated on a mostly partis an vote in subcommittee But Republicans sought a compromise after President Bush announced he would meet with California Gov Gray Davis during a trip to the state next week Davis has advocated price controls and has been outspoken in criticizing th e Bush administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for opposi ng them The committee talks also came as the possibility of Senate passage of price controls brightened considerably with the decision of Sen James Jeffords o f Vermont to bolt the Republican Party Jeffords move handed the chairmanshi p of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM who has already included price controls in his version of an energy bill Republicans on the House Energy Committee were optimistic a deal could be struck but Democrats said the talks were in the very early stages GOP members from California and other Western states were facing increased political pressure to negotiate We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement said Rep Billy Tauzin RLa the committee chairman But Rep Anna Eshoo DAtherton said of a deal Its in its infancy a premature baby at best Its been a good giveandtake Was a deal struck No Neither side would discuss the details of a potential compromise though there were some indications it might involve imposing a socalled costbase d rate structure on up to percent of the wholesale electricity power marketers sell allowing the remaining percent to be sold at competitive market rates William Massey one of two Democrat commissioners at the FERC said tempora ry federal price controls are legally justified and necessary to avert an impending energydriven economic disaster on the West Coast Massey has so far been overruled in his efforts to impose temporary price controls but two new commissioners whose nominations are on the Senate flo or could change the equation The question is should we ignore a tool that is in our toolbox and has bee n in our toolbox for years that we can use on a temporary basis lets say for the next months to get prices under control he said Wednesday The Bees Les Blumenthal can be reached at or Exec reacts hotly to California claim By Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON A top El Paso Corp executive strongly denounced as inaccura te and implausible allegations by California officials that the Houstonbased company willfully withheld supplying natural gas through its pipeline to bolster profits The company official testified yesterday before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative law judge examining charges that the Houstonbase d conglomerate cost California billions of dollars The company did not have a financial incentive to withhold pipeline capaci ty in order to increase natural gas prices in California said Ralph Eads president of El Paso Merchant Energy which markets natural gas on pipeline s from Texas and New Mexico into California Merchant is a division of El Paso Corp which operates a key pipeline that supplies about onesixth of Californias natural gas Eads is a corporate executive vice president He said that although Merchant earned more than million in pretax profits in selling natural gas in the past year the company lost potential ly hundreds of millions of dollars more by entering into longterm contracts under what is known as a hedging strategy During afternoon testimony yesterday Eads repeatedly denied suggestions by an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission that the company kept gas capacity out of the hands of other marketers to drive up profits between November and March The California PUC lawyer Harvey Morris suggested that Merchant failed to aggressively market its natural gas and knew that it would only use percent of capacity Not so said Eads We bought capacity to use it he testified In testimony filed with FERC Eads said The allegations made against Merchant by the California Public Utilities Commission and supporter interveners are not only inaccurate they are also implausible California officials have accused El Paso Corp and its gas marketing compa ny of using its marketing muscle to drive up the price of gas sold in Californ ia by more than billion Two financially troubled state utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison have joined in the states case against El Paso Testimony before Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr is expected to continue into ne xt week Wagner plans to make a recommendation to FERC this summer State power regulators aim to keep more power on grid By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO Californias biggest power users from factories to farm s now can sign up for even more programs that offer cheaper electricity in exchange for less power use potentially cutting the states energybuy ing costs by lowering demand The state Public Utilities Commission also decided Thursday to begin reexamining the calculation that determines which residential customers of the states two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent record rate increase Last year voluntary blackouts by socalled interruptible customers kept as much as megawatts on the states power grid enough electricity to power more than million homes By being first in line for blackouts or cutting use these customers also help managers of the states power grid leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases The PUC hopes even more customers will participate this year meaning less highpriced electricity the state would have to buy to keep homes and businesses humming Negawatts are our cheapest source of power said PUC Commissioner Richa rd Bilas The state already has paid billion to buy electricity for the customers of the states three largest utilities The PUC will allow big customers to sign up for more than one program to stretch the states meager supply of electricity One program promises not to subject the customers to rolling blackouts if they slash their power use by up to percent while blackouts are rolling through the rest of the state Another program offers customers cents for every kilowatt hour they don t use during one of a trio of fourhour blocks between am and pm The PUC also will reexamine how it determines baseline a varying level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated to determine if it is still accurate and fair since its last update nearly a decade ago It is time to conduct that review said Commissioner Jeff Brown adding that a new calculation for baseline would not be available until winter at earliest long after customers begin paying the biggest rate hike in California history Baseline is percent to percent of the average amount of electricity used by residential customers in the same climatic and geographical area I t provides a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge Customers are now charged progressively more when their electric us e rises above percent of their baseline Ratepayers throughout the state say baselines are unfair since they dont take household size or the growing number of electronic gadgets into accoun t However while changing the baseline may spare more customers it would als o make remaining customers pay even more Slater asks Sempra to purchase generators May San Diego County Supervisor Pam Slater is asking Sempra Energy to provide million for the purchase of portable generators to be used during rolling blackouts this summer Slaters request was made in a letter sent yesterday to Sempra President Steven Baum and comes one day after the Board of Supervisors turned down a similar request A coalition of businesses asked supervisors Tuesday to pay for the generators but supervisors rejected the request saying the county cannot legally spend taxpayers dollars on energy generation Slaters letter to Baum said that Sempra does not face that restriction Sh e added It is incumbent upon Sempra Energy to supply enough energy for the San Diego region to reduce the possibility of rolling blackouts A Sempra official said the company will not pay for the generators and said it already is spending billion on power plants and natural gas pipelines on the West Coast to address the energy crisis President will find Californians upset at his energy stance By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May When George W Bush arrives in California next week for the first time as president he will find a solid majority of residents who believe he is doi ng a bad job of dealing with the states mounting energy woes A new Field Poll also finds that Californians who were once willing to give Gov Gray Davis the benefit of the doubt now disapprove of the way he is handling the crisis as well The nonpartisan statewide public opinion survey asked Californians to rate how individuals or entities are doing on the energy front The strongly negative appraisal of Bush ranks up there with outofstate electricity generators public utilities and regulatory agencies that have long been portrayed as the villains in the crisis Its incredible to me that Bush is rated in that league said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll I think thats an ominous sign of the mood Californians are in visavis the federal government dragging its feet on providing any shortterm relief He said the numbers seem to signal that the Democratic portrayal of Bush as a captive of big oil and more sympathetic to corporate energy interests tha n consumers is taking hold with the public Its starting to stick he said It does seem to be an issue that the Republican administration is vulnerable on The Field Poll conducted telephone interviews with a representative sample of adult Californians between May and Sunday Statistically such a poll is considered accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points The poll found Californians are pessimistic about the prospects of a reliab le supply of electricity being guaranteed anytime soon On the average they said they expected the crisis to last more months which would take it beyond November when Davis faces a reelection bid Thats obviously something the Davis administration hopes would not play out said DiCamillo In January the Field Poll showed Davis energy efforts were favorably regarded by Californians At the time percent said Davis was doing a go od job managing the energy situation while percent critiqued his performan ce as fair and percent as poor Now only percent regard the governors handling of the situation favorably compared with percent who rate it as fair and percent as poor Californians appraisal of Bushs performance on the energy front is considerably more harsh with percent saying he is doing a poor job and only percent saying he is doing a good job Bush had not yet taken offi ce when the January poll was conducted Other entities ranked in order of their negative rating Private electric utilities percent outofstate energy providers percent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission percent California Public Utilities Commission percent Vice President Dick Cheney percent state Legislature percent Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham percent industrial and business energy consumers percent The only entity Californians regard positively for dealing with the electricity problems turns out to be Californians themselves Residential energy consumers were rated as doing a good job percent to percent fair and percent poor That is almost the reverse of January when residential users were rated only percent good percent fair and percent poor Its conservation said DiCamillo The public has changed its habits sin ce January They think theyre doing as good a job as can be expected but all the others are just not up to it POLL Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis May SAN FRANCISCO Over the past four months Californians have developed increasingly negative feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in Californias energy crisis according to a Field Poll released Thursday A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas Electrics bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provide service to its customers Fiftyseven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute a Sa n Franciscobased nonpartisan polling organization gave Californias private electric utilities a poor rating Thats more than the percent of respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January The same negative feelings held true for outofstate energy providers Fiftyfive percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poo r a noticeable increase from the percent of respondents who gave them a po or rating in January Specifically those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state The poll found that The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Commission a poor rating rose from percent in January to percent in May percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May as opposed percent in January percent gave Gov Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the states energy woes a sharp increase from percent who gave him a po or rating in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from respondents In May percent said FERC was doing a poor job as opposed to percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January Those surveyed were also asked if PGEs bankruptcy would make it more difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers and percen t said they thought it would The poll which questioned California adults between May and May has a margin of error of plus or minus percentage points the institute said California PUC to earmark more electricity for grid By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO State power regulators are considering expanding the men u of programs that offer cheaper energy to customers who voluntarily cut their power use Its part of an effort to muddle through an energystrapped summ er in California with a meager supply of megawatts The state Public Utilities Commission could also begin looking into whether baseline a level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated is accurate and fair In March the PUC released a package of socalled interruptible load programs which offer discounted electric bills to factories schools and other big users if they agree to be first in line for rolling blackouts By cutting their use these customers help managers of the states power gr id leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases Loretta Lynch PUC president said the commission hopes to boost participation by allowing customers who participated in interruptible programs earlier in the year to also join new programs Under one such program businesses could avoid surprise blackouts by opting for dimmed lights and reduced power during the duration of outages througho ut the state The PUC is also considering funding interruptible programs for the states three largest investorowned utilities as they go into effect rather than forcing utilities to wait for retroactive funding a year later The commission also plans to examine whether the PUC should change how residential customers baselines are calculated to better reflect household size and a spike in electronic gadgets Baseline is a certain amount of electricity guaranteed at the lowest price utilities charge Customers who exceed their baselines by more than percent are subject to rate hikes I think its clear that baselines were set too low and didnt reflect actu al electricity usage Lynch said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network warned that potentially changing baseline would simply push the rate hikes onto differe nt customers If you think about the rate increase as sort of a balloon if you push on it someplace its going to pop out somewhere else Spatt said Lynch said the commission would likely postpone many orders affecting vario us aspects of the natural gas industry in favor of meshing them together in a comprehensive gas strategy I dont think they anticipate any problems with natural gas this summer or winter Lynch said A PUC investigation into whether natural gas and electricity generators and sellers illegally drove up prices by withholding energy during times of highest demands continues What we saw was a pattern of individual behavior which all tracked around the same time which I believe contributed to the high prices Lynch said Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES California would get a little power and a lot of pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov Gray Davis that would pay owners of backup generators to produce electricity The proposal one of several options the governor is considering would pay for diesel power which at its dirtiest is times more polluting tha n the cleanest natural gas power plants when electricity supplies are stretc hed If backup generators were to be used it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we ar e in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators Th at would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garvey executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electri c grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the states power crunch began regional airquality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen a buil ding block of asthmainducing smog Davis Orders Tiered Warnings of Blackouts By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOIn a significant policy change aimed at minimizing busines s and consumer disruptions Gov Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a threetier blackout warning system Forecasts of blackouts will be issued hours beforehand Davis said General areas will be identified in warnings issued hours before likely outages Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu t he said Business executives police and consumers have complained that the current warning systemin which blackouts can come with less than minutes warningdoes not give them sufficient time to save information on computers shut down assembly lines safeguard traffic intersections and otherwise prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out In the past state grid operators only gave short notice because they often found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts They said they did not want to repeatedly alarm people Utility officials have said they feared that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to looters and burglars But crime has not been a problem during Californias six days of blackouts so far this year And with experts predicting dozens of days of forced outages this summer state and utility leaders say Californians are better off prepared If blackouts are going to occur Davis said there is no reason to keep the public in the dark We all deserve as much advance notice as possible Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio and television announcements Starting with June utility bills Southern California Edison customers will be given block numbers that allow them t o learn through the Edison Web site wwwscecom if they are scheduled for rotating blackouts on days of short supply Under the governors order Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said consumers can expect hour warnings about general areasSanta Monica or Santa Ana for examplethat might be targeted for hourlong blackouts At minutes before a blackout is triggered Bennett said the warnin gs delivered through radio television and the Internet will get much more precise For example he said One hour before well say Main Street in Santa Monica will be affected Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governors order by June And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear of blackout warnings they said the governors order will ultimately help the state avoid blackouts I think were going to save power potentially lives were going to help save jobs and Californias economy said Carl Guardino a member of t he board that oversees the California Independent System Operator which manag es of the states transmission system Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca who said he intends to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today For some the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the state is failing to solve the energy crisis It obviously says were surrendering to the electricity crisis said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Here weve arrived in the st century with all the electronics and we dont have the power to run them Utility spokesmen lauded the plan but said that much of the responsibility rests with CalISO which is the only entity that has the ability to track supplies If the ISO only gives us minutes warning our customers will get something less than minutes notice said John Nelson spokesman for Pacific Gas Electric As it works now CalISO informs utilities of pending blackouts The utility in turn informs county offices of emergency services Using computerized calling email and manual dialing the utilities also inform law enforcement major industrial users people on life support and other consumers for whom electricity is vital Nelson said Californians at large are expected to learn of the warnings through th e media and the CalISO Web site wwwcaisocom Also on Thursday Davis met with officials of Californias publicly owned utility districts and came away he said with promises that they wou ld sell excess power to the state at prices significantly lower than on the sp ot market Copyright Los Angeles Times PUC to Reassess Rate Hikes Energy State regulators vote to reexamine baselines used to determine how much customers will pay for power Consumers say allotments are too low By TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writer SAN FRANCISCONine days after structuring the largest electricity rat e increase in California history state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay If the indicators are revised upward as most expect that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases The energy crisis put the esoteric term baseline on the minds of millions of utility customers During recent hearings on a billion rat e increase the California Public Utilities Commission heard a chorus of complaints from consumers who said their baseline was unrealistically low exposing them unfairly to the rate hike The most visible and controversial issue other than the overall increase ordered was the methodology used to spread the increased revenue requirement to residential customers the PUC said in voting unanimously t o reassess baselines On March the PUC approved rate increases for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co but exempted people in a lowincome program and customers consuming less than of their baseline which is to of average residential usage with allowances for climate and season But other customers will pay more depending on how much their consumption exceeds the baseline Reassessment of the baselines commissioners said will not be complet ed for the summer when new rate hikes go into full swing but it could be don e by winter Public hearings are scheduled for July Several commissioners acknowledged that an upward adjustment in baselines would bring in less money from utility customers and could create a funding shortfall for future power purchases There is no question the baseline is out of whack Commissioner Richard Bilas said later But if the revenue base falls where do you get the money Another rate increase This is the problem Thousands of consumers contacted the PUC about the last rate increase and hundreds complained about difficulty in achieving their baseline allotments even when they worked hard to conserve Baselines have been used to chart utility bills for the past quartercentury and they are periodically updated The levels vary by area and utility They are not adjusted by househol d size And critics say they do not accurately reflect power needs of homes with computers VCRs and microwaves We heard lots of customers complain its not fair said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for Toward Utility Rate Reform For example if you have lots of children who do not contribute income but use electricity you could be at a disadvantage Living below baseline may not be easy for many Spatt whose baseline for her San Francisco home is kilowatt hours goes so far as to dry her laundry on a clothesline but was slightly above of baseline in March Bilas home in Mendocino County has a baseline of about kilowatt hours and he says he consumes more than I dont know how anyone can live on the baseline he said But he added I have a hot tub I can turn off Copyright Los Angeles Times We Arent That Desperate Who hasnt stood at a street corner and recoiled from the noxious hot sooty exhaust spewing from a diesel bus or truck As bad as that is the exhaust of standby dieselfueled electric power generators is worse These smelly noisy machines are typically used by large businesses as emergency power backupsin earthquakes for instance They have virtually no polluti on controls and pose a health risk Under normal circumstances these generators might almost never be used But Gov Gray Davis is considering issuing an executive order to pay owners of these backup generators to run them constantly during Stage power alerts the highest alert before rolling blackouts This is an agonizing choice but the health riskthese generators pour out nitrogen dioxide a chief smog ingredienttips the balance against them A Davis spokesman say s the generators an estimated of them statewide would be run only as a last resort But if the aim was to avert blackouts they could be running f or hours at a time As The Times Gary Polakovic reported Thursday the generators are concentrated in areas including Los Angeles that already have severe air quality problems Environmentalists are protesting saying it would be better and more practical to pay companies to conserve power The governor also has a plan to cut from the bills of homeowners and businesses that reduce power use b y That program if pursued aggressively and in combination with other incentives now being offered would probably save as much power as the dies el generators could make To use these units in an attempt to stave off blackouts is too desperate and could cause more harm than it prevents Copyright Los Angeles Times Energy Crisis as Political Payback

its time for our leaders to act like adults Davis and Bush always will have their political differences but the economies of both the state and the nation are endangered by Californias energy situation These leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible starting next week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California visit Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues Good start Lets hope the conversation is civil and that the civility spreads No matter how much California has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric power generation this year and next Usuall y the biggest targets of official and public wrath are the investorowned utilities such as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co But not this time because in the view of the state the utilities have bee n bled dry by the power generators stratospheric prices The state had to ta ke over the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and PGE Legal recourse should be pursued but the threatening rhetoric needs to subside State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White House for refusin g to use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholesale price controls And Davis is justifiably upset with Bush and with Cheney who said the only solution was to build more power plantsignoring the fact that the state i s building plants now with five more on the way and that the only way to control wholesale power rates is for Washington to cap them If the state hadnt bought the power the generators

Times An air of discontent over diesel backups Emissions rules ignore emergency generators Carolyn Said Chronicle Staff Writer Friday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Gov Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage electricity alerts as a way to stave of f blackouts And when blackouts do occur thousands of tractortrailersize generators will whir to life powering elevators and lights hospital equipment even assembly lines But that prospect has created major concerns Most of those industrial strength generators run on diesel oil a highly polluting fuel Because the y were intended for emergency use generators have escaped most environmental regulations Whats more they are likely to be called into service on the hottest smoggiest days of the year We think our air quality will be significantly worse this summer because o f diesel generators and peaker plants said Dan Jacobson a legislative advocate with the California Public Interest Research Group in Sacramento Identified as a toxic air contaminant by the state diesel fuel spews out nitrogen oxides which cause smog and acid rain It also emits particulate matter tiny soot and dust particles that can lodge in the lungs and may increase cancer risk Diesel generators produce as much as five times more pollution per megawatt hour of operation than even the oldest dirtiest coalfired power plants according to the California Air Resources Board They are times as polluting as modern gaspowered plants Practically every hospital large office building and apartment complex has a diesel generator standing by on the roof or parking lot in basements and boiler rooms The air board estimates there are diesel generators in California which produce an average of kilowatts enough to power essential functions for a sizable building But the number is probably much higher because businesses have stampeded to acquire generators over the past few months Generators operate in an urban setting close to where people work and live said Kenneth Lim supervising air quality engineer for the Bay Area Air Quality District If there were widespread rolling blackouts and thes e engines fired up all at the same time the impact could be very significant INCREASED CANCER RISK The California Air Resources Board said that operating a onemegawatt diese l engine for hours per year would increase cancer risk to nearby residen ts within one city block by in a million percent more than the existing cancer risk from exposure to ambient diesel fumes from trucks and buses Diesel generators largely avoided aircontrol laws because regulators assum ed they would be used only in case of an earthquake or other onceina bluemoon catastrophe Stage alerts and blackouts are likely to be everyday occurrences this summer Predictions range from hours to as high as hours of blackouts Most blackouts and Stage alerts will occur on hot days when air quality i s already poor Our worstcase scenario would be if we get into a two three or fourday episode where its really hot and really stagnant said Lucia Libretti spokeswoman for the air quality district Its bad enough smogwise on those days but when you add these dirty diese l backup generators to that mix its not going to be a pretty sight This summers predicted blackouts have brought a surge of business for generator companies GENERATING FAST SALES Caterpillar Inc the leading manufacturer of big generators said it has sold and rented more than megawatts of portable power on the West Coast so far this year enough to power almost million homes Thats seven time s as much backup power as Caterpillar provided to the region last year The customers include factories data centers banks utility substations and planned communities Everyone in the state is now claiming that they need a backup generator said CalPIRG lobbyist Jacobson Its not just the hospitals every busines s says they need a backup the rich people who live in Beverly Hills say they need it The door is open and everyone is trying to get one Small backup generators sold at Costco and Kmart that provide enough power for say a TV some lights and a blender run on gasoline which emits fewe r pollutants than diesel But most business commercial and agricultural users turn to diesel engines which can handle heavier loads kick on in seconds and provide a steady stream of power One positive about the rush to get new generators is that they pollute less than older models They arent blacksmokebillowing units like you might have seen or years ago said Jim Parker director of electric power for Caterpillar in Peoria Ill Diesel fumes from buses trucks tractors and construction equipment alread y surround us But their emissions are regulated unlike those from generator s DIRTY BUT ESSENTIAL Allen Schaeffer executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum which promotes the use of diesel fuel said it is important to consider the big picture You have to look at the full equation of increased risk to public health a nd safety from not having generators during blackouts he said Generators are a very important part of keeping life going especially essential critical services in California Consumer advocates and environmentalists were critical of Davis proposal t o turn on diesel generators when the power supply gets tight If the governor wants to do something dramatic why not call in the Nation al Guard to install solar panels

Pledging to take some of the uncertainty out of summer blackouts Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan yesterday to tell specific neighborhoods about probable rotating outages an hour in advance Davis earlywarning plan would also require utilities to give a hour warning of possible blackouts That would be followed by a hour warning of what neighborhoods would be hit Then one hour before the actual blackout the California Independent System Operator and utilities will notify the neighborhoods where power wil l probably be shut off Californians wouldnt have to have their utility block numbers committed to memory to know if blackouts are likely to hit their home office or child s day care center under Davis plan Details still need to be worked out but the plan envisions an outreach system whereby customers would be told through media alerts and other outreach including possible Web sites which geographic areas would be affected Currently only people who know which Pacific Gas and Electric Co block th ey live or work in know if they could be subjected to blackouts and media alerts come only minutes before the power goes off If blackouts are going to occur theres no reason to keep the public in t he dark Davis said A PGE representative said the company hopes to have more information available on its Web site as well as an number people can call to lear n what block they are in For several months weve been looking at ways to improve our customer notification process Ron Low PGE spokesman said We are looking at designing new programs and new ways to provide information on outages Businesses and consumers favor greater warning of impending blackouts The Democratic governor said such warnings would also allow law enforcement mor e time to put officers in the field particularly at busy intersections where traffic lights may go dark Davis said that within a few days he will issue an executive order requirin g that utilities begin to issue the warnings Administration officials said the Office of Emergency Services will work wi th the Public Utilities Commission and the utilities on the plan Utilities will also be responsible for providing law enforcement agencies with detailed maps identifying the locations of vulnerable populations including nursing homes schools and highrises as well as the location of facilities exempted from blackouts such as hospitals Within an hour of Davis announcement the California Independent System Operator board of directors approved a motion implementing the advanced notification system Elena Schmid vice president of corporate and strategic development for the ISO told the board it is important to remember that the key term in any early warning system is probable The ISO data showed that blackouts would not be needed percent of the ti me after a warning was given minutes in advance which was the staff recommendation A warning given minutes in advance as was adopted by the board would probably result in even more false alarms Schmid said Of the hours since January that blackouts appeared likely minutes out they were actually called times In other energyrelated matters yesterday Davis Said several municipal utilities including the city of Palo Alto and th e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power have agreed to supply their exce ss power to the state at prices below spot market prices Until now the municipal utilities had been selling their power at high prices leading some to say that they were gouging the state I believe the prices municipal utilities have charged the state during the past are unconscionable Davis said in a statement after the meeting The re was a strong commitment made from the municipal utilities to provide the state with excess power at lower reasonable costs whenever possible Threatened yesterday to sue if federal regulators dont limit the prices the state is being charged to buy electricity The threat came just days before President Bush

As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the

by a point margin are not inclined to support Davis for reelection His approval rating which stood at an impressive percent in January has plummeted to percent In recent weeks Davis advisers have poohpoohed reports of the governors growing political weakness noting that the Republicans had mustered no strong candidate to oppose him But that may be changing In a Thursday interview with the Mercury News outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said he would love to tackle the problems confronting the state and promised a decision on his candidacy by the end of next month The Field Poll showed Davis and Riordan running neckandneck in a trial heat Poll director Mark DiCamillo said the most alarming news for Davis in the poll is that opposition to the governor is intense while his support is on ly lukewarm Just percent of those polled said they were very inclined to reelect him while percent said they were not at all inclined Bob Mulholland political adviser to the California Democratic Party shrugged off the survey noting that Gov Pete Wilson overcame a point deficit to challenger Kathleen Brown in to win by points Aides to Davis said they look forward once again to confounding critics of the governor who lagged behind his two primary opponents for months in Advisers unruffled Weve seen this movie before said Garry South Davis political advise r about the poll There nothing in there that makes me quake in my boots The Field Poll is the latest in a string of surveys that have given Republicans hope for retaking the corner office they controlled for year s

campaign war chest for his reelection Associated Press file California Gov Gray Davis With Democrats claiming the bulk of statewide offices and majorities in bot h houses of the Legislature Republicans are at a low mark in terms of influence The energy deregulation bill at the root of the power problem wa s written by a Republican assemblyman and signed by former Republican Gov Pe te Wilson And it is Republicans polls show that the public most closely links with the greedy generators and powerrich Texans they blame for skyrocketing electricity bills Davis couldnt have picked a better political moment to fumble said University of CaliforniaIrvine political scientist Mark Petracca Despit e the quicksand hes in Republicans arent standing on solid ground either They are as culpable for the mess as Democrats are and besides that they dont have a leader To unseat an incumbent the rule of thumb is that a party needs an issue an d a candidate Republicans think they have their issue now A recent private poll showed that the energy crisis was the top concern of percent of Californians surveyed More telling was that education ranked second but w as only cited by percent a huge gap and a stunning drop for the issue tha t Davis has tried to make his top priority The real challenge The candidate part however is stickier Republicans start at a disadvanta ge in a state where voters overwhelmingly approve of abortion rights gun control and protecting the environment And at the moment the GOPs likeliest candidates for governor are Secretar y of State Bill Jones who suffers from a lack of name recognition and a poor track record at fundraising and William E Simon Jr a wealthy Los Angele s businessman and philanthropist who has no political experience and ties to the savings and loan and oil and gas industry that could hurt Davis is extremely vulnerable but neither of these individuals is the right candidate to defeat him said one GOP consultant who asked not to be identified Indeed the Field Poll shows Davis with doubledigit leads against either Simon or Jones Thats why the GOP flirted earlier this year with maverick choices such as movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger who ultimately said he is not interested More recently talk in GOP circles has turned to Riordan and former Stanfor d provost Condoleezza Rice Many Republican insiders doubt that Rice who garnered percent to Davis percent in the Field Poll would want to leave her position as President Bushs national security adviser But Riord an may be more interested Riordan fits Assemblyman Rod

the ship because this ship is heading toward the iceberg Pacheco said Dick Riordan is the only one who fits On Thursday Riordan told the Mercury News he will decide whether to run by the end of June Although he was looking forward to retirement and final ly learning to play golf he said his IrishCatholic conscience and his wifes support of whatever he decides could motivate him to run He said

regulators aim to keep more power on grid Posted at am PDT Friday May BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators are busy devising ways to curb demand among the states heaviest users during peak periods From factories to farms Californias biggest power users are being encouraged to sign up for even more programs that offer cheaper electricity in exchange for less power use potentially cutting the states energybuying costs by lowering demand The state Public Utilities Commission also decided Thursday to begin reexamining the calculation that determines which residential customers of the states two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent record rate increase Last year voluntary blackouts by socalled interruptible customers kept as much as megawatts on the states power grid enough electricity to power more than million homes By being first in line for blackouts or cutting use these customers also help managers of the states power grid leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases The PUC hopes even more customers will participate this year meaning less highpriced electricity the state would have to buy to keep homes and businesses humming Negawatts are our cheapest source of power said PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas The state already has paid billion to buy electricity for the customers of the states three largest utilities The PUC will allow big customers to sign up for more than one program to stretch the states meager supply of electricity One program promises not to subject the customers to rolling blackouts if they slash their power use by up to percent while blackouts are rolling through the rest of the state

more PUC reviews baseline formula for setting rates Posted at pm PDT Thursday May BY MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News SAN FRANCISCO Responding to complaints from across the state energy regulators Thursday said they would examine whether adjustments are needed to the baseline levels that determine how much electricity residential users g et at a reduced price The formula behind the once obscure baseline has suddenly become crucial to millions of Californians Under a new state law customers who keep their electrical usage at or near the baseline levels on their bills are exempt from rate increases that take effect next month Now that the baseline is so important officials with the state Public Utilities Commission said they want to make sure it is applied as fairly as possible We want to move aggressively on this said Commissioner Jeff Brown The baseline was established two decades ago to guarantee households a minimum amount of electricity at the lowest possible price It is supposed to represent percent to percent of the average customers usage for each climate zone The current system accounts for differences in climate and seasons with residents in warmer climates given higher amounts of baselinepriced electricity The calculation has been criticized recently for not taking into account th e energy needs of homebased businesses or family and home size PUC officials said they would probably examine several issues including changing household characteristics and whether geographic boundaries should be redrawn Any changes also would affect the baseline for natural gas Commissioners cautioned against any heavyhanded tinkering with the baselin e State and utility officials already are counting on a certain amount of revenue from the new rate increase Shielding too many more customers from the increases ultimately could saddle other residential and business users with higher rates officials said This is not going to be a giveaway program Brown said State lawmakers also are mulling changes to the baseline law which was created in State Sen Jackie Speier DSan Mateo is carrying a bill that would order the PUC to take into consideration the presence of children when calculatin g a households baseline The Senate Energy Committee passed the bill Thursday on a vote It goes next to the Senate Appropriations Committee Also Thursday the PUC adopted a program that offers business customers dramatically cheaper electricity if they reduce usage during preset fourho ur blocks throughout the day That program comes on top of another program adopted earlier that exempts businesses from blackouts if they agree to reduce their usage by percent during highdemand periods The PUC postponed action on what to do about small independent power generators that are owed billion from the states two largest utilitie s Contact Michael Bazeley at or Regulators Companies pushed up price of power Posted at pm PDT Thursday May BRANDON BAILEY AND CHRIS OBRIEN Mercury News After months of investigation state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices Now they must decide whether those companies have done anything illegal State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence strongly suggests power companies acted illegally to drive up prices H e has said that he would love to put top energy executives in jail But he and other state regulators acknowledged they are still trying to decide what laws may have been broken Californians universally believe were getting ripped off that theres serious pricegouging Lockyer said Thursday However profittaking ca n be legal It depends on how you do it And how much you do it Lockyer said he is not ready to file charges and that it may be two months before he wraps up his investigation His office one of five state agencie s investigating the electricity industry along with two legislative committees is mulling over options ranging from criminal charges to a civi l lawsuit The legal issues are difficult agreed Gary Cohen chief counsel for th e states Public Utilities Commission which is coordinating its investigatio n with Lockyers office Finding the right legal theory and making it stick is challenging Power industry spokesmen deny any wrongdoing Reliant is participating in the market not manipulating the market said a statement issued this week by Reliant Energy which owns several plants in Southern California But PUC President Loretta Lynch said last week that her agency has evidence of power plant operators cutting back their output at certain times then ramping production up and down in what appeared to be an effort to driv e up prices by manipulating supplies Economists with the states Independent System Operator meanwhile say the ir studies show power suppliers used sophisticated bidding strategies to drive up prices and rake in billion more last year than they would have earned in a truly competitive market High selling prices After analyzing thousands of transactions in the states wholesale markets ISO experts concluded that power suppliers including some public utilities as well as private companies were able to sell electricity at prices highe r than production and fuel costs would seem to warrant But some antitrust experts say this isnt illegal unless theres a coordinated effort by more than one company which the power industry denies Other experts have noted a third type of gaming in which power supplie rs appeared to be taking advantage of localized bottlenecks in the states transmission grid either by producing too much power or too little and then earning a bonus when grid operators paid them to either scale back production or provide a little extra to help balance out supply and demand In one prominent example Oklahomabased Williams Energy recently paid million to settle a rare enforcement proceeding brought by the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission after state officials accused the company of profitin g from the shutdown of two power plants that served a local transmission area Williams however admitted no wrongdoing While industry representatives mostly blame high prices on short supplies some also say there is nothing wrong with reducing their output when prices are low and increasing production when prices go up as long as they meet a ll their contractual obligations to produce power Thats the way the market works said Gary Ackerman of the Western Powe r Trading Forum Weve designed a system where every hour power plant owners can make decisions about whether to produce or not produce given whatever excess capacity is not committed to someone else But some regulators while refusing to disclose specifics say their eviden ce suggests something more sinister Some generators appear to have withheld power during Stage alerts when t he states reserves were extremely limited said the PUCs Cohen For generators to withhold supply under those conditions is wrong he said And we believe its unlawful Straining equipment PUC officials say they are concerned that the ramping behavior does mor e than drive up prices in the short term They also suspect it puts extra strain on old equipment contributing to an abnormally high number of power plant breakdowns which in turn has made supply problems worse over the past year As part of its investigation the PUC has hired former utility workers to help inspect power plants and review operating records The attorney generals office has subpoenaed a mountain of records including generator data from an industry Web site that critics believe was used by power companies to share competitive information Investigators also have subpoenaed records of communication between control room operators who directly control the output of each generating unit an d energy traders who buy and sell that output for the parent company While Lockyer says criminal charges are possible some experts predict the state will file a civil lawsuit in part because there is a lower standard of proof in civil court No smoking gun Lawsuits alleging civil violations can bring fines and damage awards While some experts say its unlikely the state could recover anywhere near the billion in excess revenue that the ISO identified Lockyer noted that antitrust laws allow a judge to award triple damages Authorities acknowledge they have no smoking gun a document or meeti ng in which power companies agreed to coordinate their production or sales But if a company knows it can hold back power until prices rise because it knows that other companies will do the same the effect is the same as if t he companies had explicitly agreed not to undercut each others prices said state Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who is chairing a legislative investigating committee The San Francisco city attorneys office has filed a lawsuit joined by San ta Clara County that alleges both direct collusion and violation of the state s unfair business law I think under either test said Owen Clements chief of special litigation for San Francisco this is a very strong case Mercury News staff writer Michael Bazeley contributed to this report Contact Brandon Bailey at or Contact Chris OBrien at or California power regulators aim to keep more power on grid Posted at am PDT Friday May BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators are busy devising ways to curb demand among the states heaviest users during peak periods From factories to farms Californias biggest power users are being encouraged to sign up for even more programs that offer cheaper electricity in exchange for less power use potentially cutting the states energybuying costs by lowering demand The state Public Utilities Commission also decided Thursday to begin reexamining the calculation that determines which residential customers of the states two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent record rate increase Last year voluntary blackouts by socalled interruptible customers kept as much as megawatts on the states power grid enough electricity to power more than million homes By being first in line for blackouts or cutting use these customers also help managers of the states power grid leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases The PUC hopes even more customers will participate this year meaning less highpriced electricity the state would have to buy to keep homes and businesses humming Negawatts are our cheapest source of power said PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas The state already has paid billion to buy electricity for the customers of the states three largest utilities The PUC will allow big customers to sign up for more than one program to stretch the states meager supply of electricity One program promises not to subject the customers to rolling blackouts if they slash their power use by up to percent while blackouts are rolling through the rest of the state Another program offers customers cents for every kilowatt hour they don t use during one of a trio of fourhour blocks between am and pm The PUC also will reexamine how it determines baseline a varying level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated to determine if it is still accurate and fair since its last update nearly a decade ago It is time to conduct that review said Commissioner Jeff Brown adding that a new calculation

is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ By Rick Stouffer The electricity supplydemand equation is simple Match supply to demand an d things are dandy Demand overwhelms supply build more supply Throughout the country but particularly in California there is no questio n more supply is mandatedNIMBY not in my backyard be hanged But what a bout the demand side of the issue What about getting customers involved in the solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system Negawatts nothing new Granted the concept of negawatts is nothing new it was coined roughly a quartercentury ago by the founder of the Boulderbased consulting firm E Source Amory Lovins Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get them through wattage rough spots from time to time All the existing independent system operators have actively considered demandside bids at one time or another according to Richard Rudden president of the consulting firm RJ Rudden Associates in Hauppauge NY But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio n Rather than a supply exchange aka an independent system operator put in place a demand exchange where customers could make a choice Do I produce widgets run my milling machines build product or take the power I would have used bid it out and see what happens Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being championed by an unlikely proponent Reliant Energy Inc The Houstonbased energy giant already has testified in Washington DC concerning the proposal has had meetings with key Western state government leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental groups The scorecard Thus far no one has laughed no one has walked away from th e conversationsno one has said no according to Reliants John H Stout senior vice president of asset commercialization Youre taking forced rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption with the customer that can take the outage doing so said Stout Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J oe Bartons Electricity Emergency Assistance bill but no big generator is pushing from the industry side like Reliant A demand exchange Like generators including Reliant bidding load into the independent syste m operator pool a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC If a particular system needed more power it would contact the clearinghouse which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped keeping in mind additional transmission charges Once the bids were identified the clearinghouse would contact the customer and its local control area The customer would interrupt and the host utili ty would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule One key to the programs success is that no one loses money The customer that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail supplier for what it didnt actually use and the customer would receive it s bid price times the megawatts curtailed minus its regular retail charges plus any payment to the transmission provider The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin said William Hogan a professor at Harvard Universitys John F Kennedy School of Government Another key to the Reliantchampioned negawatt program is that it is not seasonal it doesnt lock a potential megawattshedder into a longterm contract You can bid into the market every day said Stout It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions to be made how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement said Richard Tabors president of the Cambridge Massbased energy consulting firm Tabors Carmanis Associates As Tabors points out customers who sell back into the market obviously are doing so to play the margin to make money But their efforts also will hav e a serious impact on the spot market price Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesnt have to be produced Tabors reasoned That lowers the marginal cost the spot market cost It really comes down to what specific megawatts are worth to someon e and not worth to me Heavy users thrilled Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt proposal We think it is a well thoughtout program We feel customers hav e the right to buy power they should have the right to sell power and ought to be compensated like the generators said John Anderson executive director of ELCON the Electricity Consumers Resource Council which represents larg e industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice sound familiarallowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up its power This is voluntary You know when you will be shut down and thus you wont incur any damages said Anderson Many proposals tell the customer to cut usage but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down Command a nd control proposals treat everyone alikeand theyre not Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t he Reliant proposal with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe r Exchange Inc APX We have had discussions with Reliant were in the business of working wit h generators said John Melby vice president for North American marketing f or Santa Clara Califbased APX According to Melby APX represents more than half the demand response in th e California ISO He said the company could utilize key computer programs and systems previously developed to get the regionwide negawatt program up and running The down side There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla n Consultant Tabors for example pointed to the White House and the Bush administrations seeming preoccupation with supply Harvards Hogan said having the power available when needed was key while Reliants Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai l customers from selling load back into the wholesale market An obvious solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill however nothing is certain in such a divided Congress Thus Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program California Gov Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when he called a meeting of all Californias generators We thought he Davis generally liked the idea Stout said Next up on Reliants hit list is S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now Davis California energy conservation czar Weve already raised the issue with him Freeman but were looking to pl ug him in Stout said Reliant Energy to lower Calif peaking unit power prices New York May BridgeNews Reliant Energy said Thursday it will lower the price of its power bids from emergency limited run time peaking units t hat have environmental permit operating restrictions despite Reliants concerns that the state will deplete the available power of these plants too soon T he company had received criticism for recent high bid prices from these plants Reliant said in a release that it initiated this move in anticipation that local air quality control boards will lift restrictions on the run time for the units In letters sent to the South Coast Air Quality Management District the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Reliant said it resubmitted their request for a n extension on the run time limits of its emergency peaking units The company said the extensions would reduce the price of bids associated with these units from the to per megawatt hour level to to per megawatt hour Extensions also would help increase the available supply of power during power emergencies Currently the emergency peaking units are allowed to ru n for only a few days per year Reliant has recently been sharply criticized for bids from these plants Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer of Reliant Energy Wholesale Group said in a statement To show we are committed to working w ith all parties we are voluntarily reducing prices in the hopes that all the decision makers in California understand the need to lower restrictions dur ing times of emergencies In essence we are doing exactly what Governor Gray Davis has suggested Perkins said But if restrictions are not lowered we will run out of pow er from these units very quickly Reliants position has been that it has purposely bid the power from the units in question at prices designed to discourage premature use preserve availability for when the state is forced into emergencies because of low power reserves Extensions from the air quality control boards would allow Reliant Energy to operate these plants without penalty during emergency times and alleviat e the need to ration the units operating time But the company said it Reliant Energy intends to lower the prices of the megawatts produced at this plant in hopes that restrictions will be raised The units affected by this commitment include units at Reliant Energys Mandalay Etiwanda and Ellwood facilities Perkins said in his statement that the focus should be on the supply problem which he considers to be the root of the current power crisis in t he state It is astonishing that many decision makers continue to take the focus off of supply in the name of political finger pointing Perkins said A s a result many Californians still do not believe there is a serious supply problem Independent power generators have come under increasing scrutiny and are being investigated by the states Attorney General Bill Lockyers office fo r gaming the market Generators are being investigated as to whether they hav e shut plants for maintenance in order to spike prices during peak

Washington All Ears By LOWELL BERGMAN and JEFF GERTH The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Curtis Hebert Jr Washingtons top electricity regulator said he had bare ly settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L Lay the head of the nations largest electricity trader the Enron Corporation Mr Hebert chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that Mr Lay a close friend of President Bushs offered him a deal If he changed his views on electricity deregulation Enron would continue to support him in his new job Mr Hebert pronounced Abear recalled that Mr Lay prodded him to back a national push for retail competition in the energy business and a faster pa ce in opening up access to the electricity transmission grid to companies like Enron Mr Hebert said he refused the offer I was offended he recalled thou gh he said he knew of Mr Lays influence in Washington and thought the refusa l could put his job in jeopardy Asked about the conversation Mr Lay praised Mr Hebert but recalled it differently I remember him requesting Enrons support at the White House he said of Mr Hebert Mr Lay said he had very possibly discuss ed issues relating to the commissions authority over access to the grid As to Mr Heberts job Mr Lay said he told the chairman that the final decision on this was going to be the presidents certainly not ours Though the accounts of the discussion differ that it took place at all illustrates Enrons considerable influence in Washington especially at the commission the agency authorized to ensure fair prices in the nations wholesale electricity and natural gas markets Enrons main business Mr Lay has been one of Mr Bushs largest campaign contributors and no other energy company gave more money to Republican causes last year than Enron And it appears that Mr Hebert may soon be replaced as the commissions chairman according to Vice President Dick Cheney the Bush administration s point man on energy policy Mr Lay has weighed in on candidates for other commission posts supplying President Bushs chief personnel adviser with a list of preferred candidate s One Florida utility regulator who hoped for but did not receive an appointment as a commissioner said he had been interviewed by Mr Lay Mr Lay also had access to the team writing the White Houses energy report which embraces several initiatives and issues dear to Enron The reports recommendations include finding ways to give the federal government more power over electricity transmission networks a longtime go al of the company that was spelled out in a memorandum Mr Lay discussed durin g a minute meeting earlier this spring with Mr Cheney Mr Cheneys report includes much of what Mr Lay advocated during their meeting documents show Both men deny discussing commission personnel issu es during their talk But Mr Lay had an unusual opportunity to make his case about candidates in writing and in person to Mr Bushs personnel adviser Clay Johnson And when Mr Bush picked nominees to fill two vacant Republic an slots on the fivemember commission they both had the backing of Enron as well as other companies Mr Lay is not shy about voicing his opinion or flexing his political muscl e He has transformed the Houstonbased Enron from a sleepy naturalgas compan y into a billion energy giant with global reach trading electricity in all corners of the world and owning a multibilliondollar power project in India He has also led the push to deregulate the nations electricity markets Senior Bush administration officials said they welcomed Mr Lays input but did not always embrace it President Bush backed away from curbing carbondioxide emissions an effort supported by Enron which had looked to trade emission rights as part of its energy business Well make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy Mr Cheney said in an interview not what Enron thinks The BushLay bond traces back to Mr Bushs father and involves a personal and philosophical affinity Moreover Enron and its executives gave million to federal candidates in the last election more than any other energy company While some of that went to Democrats percent went to Republicans according to an analysis of election records by the Center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit group Hes for a lot of things were for said Mr Johnson But when it came to deciding on nominees for the commission Mr Johnson sa id that Mr Lays views were not that crucial The two most important advisers he said were Andrew Lundquist the director of Mr Cheneys energy task force and Pat Wood rd the head of the Texas public utility commission As governor Mr Bush named Mr Wood to the utility commission This year when the White House filled the two Republican slots on the federal agency Mr Wood was the first choice Mr Johnson said Consumer advocates and business executives praise Mr Wood But Mr Lay als o had a role in promoting him Shortly after Mr Bush was elected governor in Mr Lay sent him a letter endorsing Mr Wood as the best qualified person for the Texas commission In all there are five seats on the commission two held by Republicans tw o by Democrats and one held by a chairman who serves at the pleasure of the president Mr Hebert who became a commissioner in was named chairma n by Mr Bush in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions mandate to ensure fair prices in wholesale electricity and natural gas markets makes it crucial to sellers like Enron as well as consumers The movement toward deregulation sometimes leaves the commission caught in a tug of war power marketers like Enron are trying to break into markets and grids controlled by oldline utilities which operate under state regulatio n The commissions chairman has considerable latitude in setting its agenda As part of its oversight of the wholesale electricity markets the commissi on ordered several companies to refund what it considered excessively high prices this year in California One lesser offender named in the commission s public filings million of a total of million was an Enron subsidiary in Oregon Enron owns few generating assets but buys and sells electricity in the market Many of those transactions resemble the complicated riskshifting techniques used by Wall Street for financial instruments Mr Hebert after he became chairman initiated an examination into the effects those techniques have on the electricity markets One of our problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex arbitrage activities of a company like Enron he said adding were trying to do it now and we may have some results soon William L Massey one of the agencys two Democratic commissioners said h e supported the inquiry but had not been aware of it an indication of the chairmans ability to set the commissions agenda Finally the commission is trying to speed the pace of electricity deregulation by opening up the nations transmission grid much of which is owned by privately owned utilities that enjoy retail monopolies Some Enron officials say the commission has been moving too slowly to open the grid They attribute some of the problem to utilities But they also fault Mr Hebert Hebert still has undeserved confidence in some of the vertically integrat ed companies coming to the table and dealing openly with transmission access issues said Richard S Shapiro an Enron senior vice president The utilities however maintain that they provide cheap and reliable servi ce for their customers Washington lobbyists for one Southern utility said tha t Enron was really interested in focusing on the utilitys bigbusiness clients which under state regulation pay higher rates than residential customers Since about half the states have moved to open their retail markets t o competition and the commission has begun to make it easier for outsiders t o use the nations transmission grid But the promise of cheaper rates has be en largely unfulfilled So the push for more deregulation in which Enron has been a leader has slowed especially when Californias flawed program led to skyrocketing rates and chaotic markets Mr Hebert is a freemarket conservative who favors deregulation but also recognizes the importance of states rights A former Mississippi regulator he is a protege of Trent Lott the Senate Republican leader from Mississipp i Mr Hebert said Mr Lott was instrumental in his nomination to the commissi on in by President Clinton President Bush elevated Mr Hebert to chairman on Inauguration Day a move Mr Lay said he told the White House he supported Mr Johnson the White House personnel chief said that Mr Lott and Mr Hebert had both been told that Mr Hebert could remain chairman at least until the administrations nominees Mr Wood and Nora Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator are confirmed by the full Senate The Senate energy committee voted earlier this week to approve the two nominees after a hearing last week indicated strong support It is widely expected that President Bush will name Mr Wood to replace Mr Hebert as chairman after the Senate acts In an interview for a forthcoming episode of Frontline the PBS series Mr Cheney suggested as much Pat Woods got to be the new chairman of th e FERC and hell have to address various problems in the electricity markets he said Mr Hebert said that no one had told him he was being replaced If someone else is named chairman Mr Hebert can remain a commissioner until the end of his term which expires in It was a few weeks after President Bush made him chairman that Mr Hebert said he spoke by telephone with Mr Lay Mr Lay told him that he and Enron would like to support me as chairman but we would have to agree on principles involving the commissions role in expanding electricity competition Mr Hebert said of the conversation A senior commission official who was in Mr Heberts office during the conversation said Mr Hebert rebuffed Mr Lays offer of a quid pro quo Th e official said that he heard Mr Heberts side of the conversation and then after the call ended learned the rest from him Mr Hebert said that he too backed competition but did not think the commission had the legal authority to tell states what to do in this area Concerning the issue of opening transmission access through the creation of regional networks Mr Hebert supports a voluntary process while Enron seek s a faster and more compulsory system Mr Lay said that while he might have discussed issues relating to the commissions authority concerning access to the grid there was never any intent to link that or any other issue to Mr Heberts job status The commission is a quasijudicial agency so decisionmakers like Mr Heber t must avoid private discussions about specific matters pending before the commission Mr Hebert and Mr Lay both said that line was not crossed but Mr Hebert said he had never had such a blunt talk with an energyindustry executive Mr Lay added that his few recent conversations with Mr Hebert were nothin g special We had a lot of access during the Clinton administration he said And he said that while making political contributions probably helps to gain access to an official he made them because Im supporting candidate s I strongly believe in Last June Enron executives were asked to make voluntary donations to the companys political action committee The solicitation letter noted that th e company faced a range of governmental issues including electricity deregulation This year some people who sought but did not get nominations to the commission said that Mr Lay and Enron had had a role in the process One was Joe Garcia a former Florida utilities regulator and prominent CubanAmerican activist He said he had been interviewed by a few Enron officials including Mr Lay who he said had not been as forceful or insistent as the other Enron officials But in their conversation Mr Garcia said Mr Lay made clear that he woul d be visiting the White House adding that everyone knew of his relationshi p and his importance Mr Johnson the White House personnel chief could not cite another compan y besides Enron that sent him a list of preferred candidates for the commission but he remembered hearing the views of Tom Kuhn who heads the utility industry trade group the Edison Electric Institute Mr Kuhn was a classmate of Mr Johnson and Mr Bush at Yale As for his conversation with Mr Garcia Mr Lay said he was comfortable wi th his candidacy but Im not sure what I told him about my friends at the White House This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series Frontline which will broadcast a documentary about Californias energy crisis on June

Mirror Company SACRAMENTO In a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business a nd consumer disruptions Gov Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a threetier blackout warning system Forecasts of blackouts will be issued hours beforehand Davis said General areas will be identified in warnings issued hours before likely outages Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu t he said Business executives police and consumers have complained that the current warning systemin which blackouts can come with less than minutes warningdoes not give them sufficient time to save information on computer s shut down assembly lines safeguard traffic intersections and otherwise prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out In the past state grid operators only gave short notice because they often found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts They said they di d not want to repeatedly alarm people Utility officials have said they feare d that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to looters and burglars But crime has not been a problem during Californias six days of blackouts so far this year And with experts predicting dozens of days of forced outages this summer state and utility leaders say Californians are better off prepared If blackouts are going to occur Davis said there is no reason to keep the public in the dark We all deserve as much advance notice as possible Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio and television announcements Starting with June utility bills Southern California Edison customers will be given block numbers that allow them t o learn through the Edison Web site if they are schedule d for rotating blackouts on days of short supply Under the governors order Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said consumers can expect hour warnings about general areasSanta Monica or Santa Ana for examplethat might be targeted for hourlong blackouts At minutes before a blackout is triggered Bennett said the warnings delivered through radio television and the Internet will get much more precise For example he said One hour before well say Main Street in Santa Monica will be affected Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governors order by June And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear of blackout warnings they said the governors order will ultimately help the state avoid blackouts I think were going to save power potentially lives were going to help save jobs and Californias economy said Carl Guardino a member of the board that oversees the California Independent System Operator which manag es of the states transmission system Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca who said he inten ds to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today For some the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the state is failing to solve the energy crisis It obviously says were surrendering to the electricity crisis said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Here weve arrived in the st century with all the electronics and we dont have the power to run them Utility spokesmen lauded the plan but said that much of the responsibility rests with CalISO which is the only entity that has the ability to track supplies If the ISO only gives us minutes warning our customers will get something less than minutes notice said John Nelson spokesman for Pacific Gas Electric As it works now CalISO informs utilities of pending blackouts The utilit y in turn informs county offices of emergency services Using computerized calling email and manual dialing the utilities also inform law enforcement major industrial users people on life support and other consumers for whom electricity is vital Nelson said Californians at large are expected to learn of the warnings through the med ia and the CalISO Web site Also on Thursday Davis met with officials of Californias publicly owned utility districts and came away he said with promises that they would sel l excess power to the state at prices significantly lower than on the spot market Legislature hangs Davis out to dry By Nick Driver Of The Examiner Staff Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov Gray Davis plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with one of their own The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San Diegoarea utility and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase PGE lines through bankruptcy proceedings And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his own transmission line deal A week ago Davis finally found a termlimited senator Richard Polanco DLos Angeles to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso n lines Now the governors office admits that talks will not proceed until the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edisons lines Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi s plan giving the state a fiveyear option to purchase all power lines for billion While a much lower price the bill would also lower Edisons debt by forcing power marketers to accept percent of the billion ow ed them Under the terms of that proposal the state would still have to loan Edison money around billion and would guarantee SoCal Edisons sale of a further billion in bonds The state would also receive a conservation easement on acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land As in the Davis bill SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively lowcost electricity for years from one of its power plants and force parent company Edison International to repay million in transfers A Republican plan labeled Plan R now making its way through the halls of the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister except it allows the state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build The Democratic bills sponsors Assemblymen John Dutra DFremont Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg believe they can persuade Edisons board of directors to approve their deal even though it is not as attractive as the governors offer Edison refused to comment on the plan Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge were trying a different strategy Wednesday The minority partys Plan R has not been introduced as official legislation but instead floated among Republicans a nd Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edisons only real alternative to bankruptcy and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern neighbor PGE in bankruptcy So far Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators charging high wholesale prices PGE declared bankruptcy April A governors office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all attention away from any dealmaking but that the two sides continued to me et frequently Another adviser Joe Fichera said there are lots of moving parts to the deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electrics transmission lines bu t that he continued to meet with company representatives including an allda y meeting Monday In San Diego a spokesman for SDGE referred all calls to t he governors office But the sponsor of the Davis bill Polanco is not one of the legislatures power brokers and most lawmakers said the billion memorandum of understanding is now in serious jeopardy A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos including the threat of an increase in blackouts The governor and business leaders have said the economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages rises Legislators policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne ed and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the state especially if the bulk of them now owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co are still not for sale Critics such as Senate President John Burton DSan Francisco one of the bills strongest proponents three months ago now say the state should not be in the business of replacing or upgrading dilapidated lines at a cost of upwards of billion Others see the state as the best candidate for improving a system long neglected by utilities State ownership of the transmission grid would be a better way to help gri d problems such as connecting wind generators said Joe Ito an energy analy st at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories It has been extremely difficult to buil d new transmission capacity over the last years especially into bottlenec ks like San Francisco Bush unveiled his Energy Plan last week including a key plank that would allow the federal government to use eminent domain to purchase private land and build more transmission lines Bush arrives Tuesday for talks with Davi s on this and other solutions to the energy crisis The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights derides both presidential a nd legislative attempts to create more consumerfriendly deals labeling them Bailout Lite The sponsors want to try and trim away some of the fat said Doug Heller a spokesman for the group But its all fat

California Issues Thank you DavisBurton feud swirls over Edison bailout Sacramento Bee Sept Davis advisers memo stirs a furor A threat to quickly expose certain Riordan donors is called extortion Sacramento Bee Sept Burton No special session necessary for energy issues San Diego Union Tribune Sept State power regulators to investigate Edisons safety record San Diego Union Tribune Sept Group to Defend Ads Criticizing Davis LA Times September DavisBurton feud swirls over Edison bailout By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept The legislative session ended Friday with a dramatic standoff between two of the states most powerful Democrats The feud between Gov Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton remained the talk of the Capitol on Monday How they resolve the intraparty dispute will have a significant effect on whether California saves the states secondlargest utility from bankruptcy Both the governor and Burton said they intend to negotiate before they bring lawmakers back sometime in early October Otherwise Burton said it might be incumbent upon people to show up on the first day and recess For now the relationship between the state Senate and the governor is strained owing partly to what some lawmakers perceived as an insult from Davis at the end of the session At issue is Davis plan to have the state help Southern California Edison reduce its debt The Senate opposes the governors plan fearing that it would punish too many small customers We passed a bill it was a lot cleaner bill and a better bill for the people of the state of California than the one that was sent back to us that the administration wanted us to vote for Burton said Monday Davis meanwhile has portrayed his plan as the only way to remove the state from the powerbuying business and prevent a second utility bankruptcy His spokesman Steven Maviglio said the governor is risking political capital to pass a deal This is an extremely unpopular bill Maviglio said Sometimes youve got to do whats right and not whats popular Over the weekend Burton said repeatedly that the Davis plan only had seven Senate votes out of the required In a week marked by the national tragedy of terrorist attacks on the East Coast the governors lastminute lobbying was not enough Sen John Vasconcellos DSanta Clara said he received calls from Edison International Chairman John Bryson Davis energy adviser Michael Peevey and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher on behalf of the Edison plan all on Friday Im not going to come back in session to twiddle my thumbs if people are going to jam me Vasconcellos said With the Edison plan doomed in the Senate Davis Saturday told legislators that he would call them back in two weeks In a statement Davis said he was proud of the work done by the Assembly but unfortunately the Senate has not gotten the job done Some Senate lawmakers perceived that as an insult to their work particularly since the governors statement came at the end of a hour workday Burton called those remarks a shameful thing Maviglio pointed to two Senate actions that upset the governor In one instance Friday Davis met with Burton but was rebuffed The governor made a personal appeal to him and said I need this Maviglio said And that was rejected Meanwhile Davis was particularly incensed that the Senate passed a resolution that would have ended Californias state of emergency and the governors emergency powers Burton said Monday that some senators were concerned that Davis would use his sweeping powers when lawmakers were out of town The Assembly eventually killed the resolution Caught unaware the governor took it as an affront You know they spit in our eye Maviglio said Its not surprising that the governor said the simple fact that the Senate failed to act Davis advisers memo stirs a furor A threat to quickly expose certain Riordan donors is called extortion By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept Gov Gray Davis top political adviser has sent an unusual memo to of the governors major contributors warning that any large donations they make to Republican challenger Richard Riordan will be disclosed during the coming weeks under new campaign finance rules The letter which was written by Garry South and mailed last week has triggered allegations of abuse of power and blackmail from Davis GOP opponents The letter has also provided voters a brief glimpse of the political mudslinging they can expect should Riordan the former mayor of Los Angeles officially declare his candidacy for the governors job Riordan who has been campaigning informally for the last few months is expected to announce his gubernatorial bid in mid to late October Exactly one month from today the whole world will know who has contributed to Riordan in the last three months and how much says the letter dated Sept Contrary to the impression being left with some potential donors the Riordan campaigns fund raising is going to be instantly transparent South argues that the onepage letter was intended to inform donors that the Riordan campaign which may have tried to solicit money from them has given out incorrect information about campaign finance disclosure deadlines We had been getting reports back that Riordan was calling our major donors trying to raise money South said Some were being led to believe that if they made contributions nobody would know about it for months Addressing the letter to friends and supporters of Governor Davis South told them that the early primary election on March has accelerated the deadlines for campaign finance disclosure statements This year he wrote the next disclosure report will be due Oct In past years when primaries were held at a later date Jan was the deadline The letter also explains that a recent bill signed by Davis SB requires statewide candidates and ballot measure committees to disclose within days contributions of at least received more than days before an election Officials from Riordans campaign however dont believe Souths motives were pure Riordan spokesman Dan Schnur said the letter is an abuse of power Its clearly a notveryveiled threat designed to prevent past Davis donors from giving money to Riordan he said Because Davis is considered a probusiness Democrat who raises money in the business community some of the donors interested in supporting Riordan likely have also given money to Davis Schnur said We have heard from several donors and potential donors who have received the letter he said Theyre outraged Campaign officials for Secretary of State Bill Jones another Republican gubernatorial hopeful also spoke out against the letter Jones spokeswoman Beth Miller labeled the memo blackmail and intimidation She said the letter seems to imply that the governor will take revenge on anyone who gives to Riordan The timing of the letter is particularly important she said It was sent just before Davis entered the intense monthlong billsigning period that ends Oct Its fair to say it borders on extortion Miller said The language of this letter is blackmail Do it and youll pay the consequences Its especially astounding that it comes during billsigning Miller said Jones probably will ask the Fair Political Practices Commission to review the letter South denied the allegations of blackmail saying the letter was not a threat He added however that its his job to run the governors campaign and to dissuade donors from giving to other candidates If someone gets that memo and says Im not going to give Riordan because its going to show up on a report days later more power to me South said Robert Stern president of the Center for Governmental Studies said the letter is typical of South who plays hardball but isnt illegal In fact Stern noted Davis is going to be affected by the same upcoming campaign finance deadlines that will force Riordan to disclose his contributions Its transparent for everybody Stern said Indeed both Riordan and Davis have had to disclose recent contributions of more than as required by SB Among Riordans contributors was Stockton developer Alex Spanos who gave on Sept Among those who gave to Davis was the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians which donated on Sept Burton No special session necessary for energy issues By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September SACRAMENTO Consumer groups and the Senates top Democrat said Monday theres no need for an extra legislative attempt to save beleaguered Southern California Edison from bankruptcy Although the Assembly voted to let Edison sell billion in bonds to pay off part of its billion debt Senate Leader John Burton said he didnt bring it up for a vote in his house as the Legislature prepared to adjourn because not enough senators would vote for it Gov Gray Davis promptly announced he would call the years third extraordinary legislative session so the Legislature could again attempt to craft a rescue plan for Edison Theres no reason to come back and stay through a third fourth fifth or sixth special session unless theres a deal Burton said Monday People arent going to vote for something that they think is morally wrong and politically dangerous for them Several senators tried to write a lessgenerous version of the Assembly plan but Edison officials said that wouldnt help them said Burton a San Francisco Democrat Members felt that they didnt want to vote for a bill that helped Edison that Edison didnt want The utility amassed billion in debt from high wholesale prices last year Without a statebacked rescue the company says it will have no choice but to follow Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy Davis announced in April that he had negotiated a plan with Edison to buy the utilitys transmission lines and let the company issue revenue bonds backed by consumers to pay its debts Lawmakers worked on several incarnations of the deal since then but couldnt reconcile the different versions that passed each house The third legislative session would deal exclusively with Edison said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio Assembly and Senate leaders would set the date for the session to start An Edisononly session Maviglio said will force the Senate to focus on only that issue The bottom line is that it has to be legislation that gets the state out of the power business and gets Edison solvent Because the Assembly didnt adjourn the second extraordinary session on energy the governor would have to call a third session to compel lawmakers to return to the capital If the governor does that Burton says hell immediately adjourn it I dont know what the Legislature can do Whatever we want to do the Edison people say it isnt enough It isnt enough They want a flat bailout Burton said The Assembly approved a drastically changed version of the Senate bill adding million to the utilitys bonding limit and including provisions to encourage renewable energy and limit cash transfers from the utility to the parent company We sent a bill to the Senate one to accomplish one of the objectives of the legislation which is to put the utility back on its feet said Paul Hefner spokesman for Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys I dont know what more there is for us to do at this point Edison officials declined to comment Monday The company had opposed the Senates plan to let Edison sell billion in bonds saying that wouldnt keep them from bankruptcy Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield said Edison has cried wolf to lawmakers five times since January setting deadlines by which it said it would file for bankruptcy Now of course they said that they can wait until Oct I dont think Edison has much credibility with the legislators at this point said Rosenfield executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights His organization has promised a ballot measure to overturn any legislation that helps the utility State power regulators to investigate Edisons safety record By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS September SAN FRANCISCO California power regulators are launching an investigation into Southern California Edisons safety record citing safety violations over three years The Public Utilities Commissions consumer services division has linked accidents to these alleged violations tracked between and Five of which resulted in deaths the PUC announced late Monday The PUC will look into Edisons compliance with state Public Utilities Code provisions and commission orders on construction operation and maintenance for electric lines and facilities Safety in the provision of utility service is a top priority for the commission said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood in a written statement The public expects PUC safety requirements to be rigorously enforced and we will meet that expectation In a written statement Monday evening Edison said it has begun a comprehensive review and analysis of the allegations We continue to believe that our program is one of the best in the indudstry and with respect to reliability of service and to the safety of our customers and employees the company said The PUCs consumer services division wrote that it had sent notices to Edison about their alleged violations The divisions report suggests there may have been a significant number of injuries and fatalities that might have been prevented by compliance with safety standards The announcement comes just days after the state Senate refused to pass a plan backed by Gov Gray Davis to let Edison sell several billion dollars in bonds to help settle its debts Davis called the years third extraordinary legislative session so lawmakers again could try to craft a rescue plan for Edison Steve Maviglio a Davis spokesman said Monday that the investigation should not adversely affect Edisons chances of receiving financial help from the state Edison along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co has struggled with debt since last summer when electricity and natural gas prices shot up A rate freeze prevented them from recovering the extra costs from customers Group to Defend Ads Criticizing Davis By ALEXA HAUSSLER Associated Press Writer September AM PDT SACRAMENTO Calif A Washington DCbased taxpayer group that criticized Gov Gray Davis handling of the statewide energy crisis is now finding itself on the defensive A judge ruled on Monday that the American Taxpayers Alliance which ran television ads criticizing the governor must register as a political committee and identify its financial backers Basically American Taxpayers Alliance has to play by the same rules that everybody else has to play by said James Harrison a San Franciscobased attorney representing Davis reelection committee James Bopp an Indianabased attorney for the taxpayer group said Monday it will appeal the ruling He said the group is not a political committee The First Amendment fully protects the right of citizens to praise or criticize the conduct of public officials while in office Bopp said This ruling strikes at the heart of that right The group ran the ads for three weeks starting June The ads ended with the phrase Grayouts from Gray Davis referring to the states rolling blackouts The alliance is headed by Scott Reed a Republican strategist and the commercials were produced by consultants who helped produce ads for President Bushs presidential campaign Davis and other Democrats say the alliances contributors include electric power generators that have been accused of overcharging the state Davis sued in July claiming the group violated the states Political Reform Act by failing to register with the California secretary of state He argued that any group advocating for or against candidates must register But Bopp accused Davis of intending to punish harass or intimidate people who criticize him Davis is up for reelection in November His popularity slipped to its lowest point in the spring when state officials were predicting a serious summer power shortage But mild weather longterm contracts with energy suppliers and other conditions led to a blackoutfree summer and Davis approval rating is rebounding Still the energy crisis which forced the states largest utility into bankruptcy proceedings and caused an electricity rate increase and rolling blackouts earlier in the year is likely to be a key issue in next years race

agreement San Diego Tribune September State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs LA Times September National crisis eclipses energy woes States bond sale as well as Edison bailout could be casualties of Wall Street turmoil September By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Terrorist attacks that disrupted Wall Street could further delay Californias plan to help itself and Southern California Edison recover from the energy crisis experts said Wednesday Among other things a billion bond sale designed to repay the state for billions it spent buying emergency electricity could be delayed until next year one legislative leader said Wednesday although others expect a shorter wait The billion in borrowing would be the largest municipal bond sale in US history It was expected to happen next month after several earlier postponements Putting it off means that if the states credit rating drops within the next few months the interest rate on the bond repayment would be higher Delays on the sale beyond Oct could cost ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars in interest on another loan the state has already taken Several pieces of Californias recovery plan are still in play as the Legislature heads toward a scheduled Friday adjournment and Wall Streets attention is on other matters A summary Terrorist attacks forcing the temporary closure of Wall Street could slow down getting the billion in energy bonds being marketed There certainly is a direct impact on Wall Street said David Freeman the head of the new California Power Authority If the place that is going to loan you money nearly got bombed out you have to assume that things wont move at the same pace that they would have But I think that will be a shortterm delay But a top legislator disagrees Were looking at January at the earliest and probably later Jaime Fisfis spokesman for Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox said referring to the billion sale Another factor not related to the terrorist attacks also is conspiring to delay the sale The PUCs longawaited decision of whether to sign off on a crucial piece of the bond sale was to be made today But PUC President Loretta Lynch says the proposal is complex and requires a longer look perhaps until Sept The PUCs approval is needed before the bonds can be marketed The state took out a shortterm loan of billion to cover energy costs while a larger bond sale was developed But that loan which was to be paid back with the bond money has a sharp interest penalty if it isnt paid off by Oct After that the interest rate rises from the original percent to about percent which means the state would have to cover an additional million to pay back the loan Many even in Gov Gray Davis administration believe missing the Oct deadline is likely I wouldnt be a bit shocked by that said Steven Maviglio Davis spokesman Two unrelated bond sales one for billion and the other for million have been postponed for at least a couple of weeks because of the New York attacks State officials say they want to wait to go to market with the two bond sales both routine until the turmoil in the East settles down The proposed bailout of Edison also could be hurt by the New York attacks said one energy expert who noted that lawmakers have only until midnight Friday to act on the plan which might include financing the utilitys debt with bonds If the Legislature adjourns without providing help to Edison it is widely believed the utility will go into bankruptcy I believe the Edison bailout package is now nonexistent said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents energy producers Maviglio disagreed saying the rescue plan will rise or fall on its own I dont think theres any effect on the bailout he said No confidentiality for energy producers By Claire Cooper Bee Legal Affairs Writer Published Sept SAN FRANCISCO Energy generators were rebuffed Wednesday in an attempt to force state Attorney General Bill Lockyer not to disclose marketing data he has subpoenaed from them Without comment or dissent the California Supreme Court voted not to review lower court decisions allowing the attorney general to share the data with others looking into possible manipulation of energy supplies including state regulators federal prosecutors and officials in Oregon and Washington state In May three generators

Reliants lawyer said he would have no comment at this time UCLA Power Crisis Damage To Calif Economy Seen Lessened Updated Wednesday September PM ET By Jessica Berthold OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornias energy crisis will drain the states economy of billions of dollars but will have a smaller impact than previously thought said Christopher Thornberg economist and coauthor of a report issued Wednesday by the University of California at Los Angeles Anderson Business Forecast team The difference can be largely chalked up to consumers paying less for electricity than was expected he said In our last paper we said that given the price of power and what we expected people to consume rate increases would have a drain on the economy Thornberg said Now we think it will be a onehalf percent drain That translates to billion lost yearly because of the electricity crisis compared to Junes estimate of billion The states economy produces trillion per year Much of the states lost dollars will come from a decline in consumer and business spending in reaction to higher electricity rates the report said The California Public Utilities Commission passed a cent per kilowatt hour rate hike for customers of PGE Corp PCG investmentsquotessymbolPCG news investmentsnewssymbolPCG msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolPCG unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Edison International EIX

investmentsquotessymbolSRE news investmentsnewssymbolSRE msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolSRE unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co soon The costs imposed on ratepayers by the states PUC will reduce economic growth from what it otherwise would be the report said These costs will total billion of dollars annually and will significantly reduce consumer and business spending for other goods and services Still the state was spared the cost of a widelyanticipated summer electricity crisis Thornberg noted The UCLA teams last report in June predicted that the summer would bring hours of blackouts and skyhigh wholesale power prices dealing a concentrated blow to the states economy But the summer crisis failed to materialize due to mild weather conservation efforts and a federal price control order that has brought wholesale prices down the report said The energy crisis is in the process of being converted from a shortterm crisis into a longerterm vexation which will nag us with a combination of higher energy prices shakier public credit bankrupt utilities and fewer choices in how state revenues will be expended the report says Because wholesale prices have declined so dramatically the UCLA team no longer predicts the state will be have billion in debt in due to the energy crisis Thornberg said A coauthor of the June report said that utility ratepayer revenue would not be enough to repay a billion revenue bond sale planned by the state to smooth out its power purchases Thats no longer the case Thornberg aid Under the current circumstances Id say there will be enough in retail rates to pay the state for power he said The costs California has been spared by the lack of a summer electricity crisis will be offset by the effects of the national recession and global economic slump the report said Personal income which accounts for more than of gross state product slowed to in the second quarter of from in the third quarter of Unemployment has risen from in February to in July and will hit in the report said Although Californias economy is not clearly in recession at this point most indicators of the job market show an end to the expansion the report said PGE Says California Power Cost Request Is Illegal Overstated By Dennis Walters San Francisco Sept Bloomberg PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Californias largest utility said a proposed plan to let the state sell billion bonds for its power costs is illegal and overstates how much money the state needs The comments came in a filing with the California Public Utilities Commission which is considering a plan for

and to cover other power costs The proposed plan is blatantly arbitrary discriminatory and unlawful and should be rejected Pacific Gas Electric said in its filing The water department this year has spent more than billion buying power on behalf of the PGE unit and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison the states No utility The utilities became insolvent after buying power at higher costs than they could charge customers under California law In a rush to give the water department a blank check the regulator proposes illegally shifting million of costs to Pacific Gas from customers in Southern California the filing said Echoing past complaints by the utility the filing also said the water department has overestimated power costs and should face public hearings over its revenue request Southern California Edison in comments filed with the PUC today also disagreed with parts of the proposed plan Edison said the plan would effectively set a fixed rate for its own generating plants and contracts with alternativeenergy providers raising the risk that the utility wouldnt recover all its costs under certain circumstances PGEs utility filed for bankruptcy

Angeles Community College District leader Beth Farfield appeared headed for an October runoff for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council THE PROBLEM High demand high wholesale energy costs transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in Californias electricity crisis Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say theyve lost nearly billion since June to high wholesale prices the states electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers PGE saying it hasnt received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the companies poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities nearly million residential and business customers The state also is buying power for a third investorowned utility San Diego Gas Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PGE but also is struggling with high wholesale power costs The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of percent for the heaviest residential customers and percent for commercial customers and hikes of up to percent for industrial customers and percent or percent for agricultural customers to help finance the states multibilliondollar power buys UCLA Power Crisis Damage To Calif Economy Seen Lessened By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Californias energy crisis will drain the states economy of billions of dollars but will have a smaller impact than previously thought said Christopher Thornberg economist and coauthor of a report issued Wednesday by the University of California at Los Angeles Anderson Business Forecast team The difference can be largely chalked up to consumers paying less for electricity than was expected he said In our last paper we said that given the price of power and what we expected people to consume rate increases would have a drain on the economy Thornberg said Now we think it will be a onehalf percent drain That translates to billion lost yearly because of the electricity crisis compared to Junes estimate of billion The states economy produces trillion per year Much of the states lost dollars will come from a decline in consumer and business spending in reaction to higher electricity rates the report said The California Public Utilities Commission passed a cent per kilowatt hour rate hike for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison in March and is expected to pass a similar increase for Sempra SRE unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co soon The costs imposed on ratepayers by the states PUC will reduce economic growth from what it otherwise would be the report said These costs will total billion of dollars annually and will significantly reduce consumer and business spending for other goods and services Still the state was spared the cost of a widelyanticipated summer electricity crisis Thornberg noted The UCLA teams last report in June predicted that the summer would bring hours of blackouts and skyhigh wholesale power prices dealing a concentrated blow to the states economy But the summer crisis failed to materialize due to mild weather conservation efforts and a federal price control order that has brought wholesale prices down the report said The energy crisis is in the process of being converted from a shortterm crisis into a longerterm vexation which will nag us with a combination of higher energy prices shakier public credit bankrupt utilities and fewer choices in how state revenues will be expended the report says Because wholesale prices have declined so dramatically the UCLA team no longer predicts the state will be have billion in debt in due to the energy crisis Thornberg said A coauthor of the June report said that utility ratepayer revenue would not be enough to repay a billion revenue bond sale planned by the state to smooth out its power purchases Thats no longer the case Thornberg aid Under the current circumstances Id say there will be enough in retail rates to pay the state for power he said The costs California has been spared by the lack of a summer electricity crisis will be offset by the effects of the national recession and global economic slump the report said Personal income which accounts for more than of gross state product slowed to in the second quarter of from in the third quarter of Unemployment has risen from in February to in July and will hit in the report said Although Californias economy is not clearly in recession at this point most indicators of the job market show an end to the expansion the report said Calif PUC Wont Vote Thu On B RevBondRelated Items Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California Public Utilities Commission wont vote Thursday on items related to the states sale of billion in revenue bonds a spokeswoman for CPUC president Loretta Lynch said Wednesday The CPUC will either meet Friday or wait until its next scheduled meeting Sept to discuss the items she said The items had already been postponed from Sept The postponed items include a rate agreement that would allow the state Department of Water Resources to recover powerbuying costs without regulatory review and an item that would establish how much revenue the DWR can receive for power purchases through The CPUC will still hold its meeting Thursday but wont be taking any votes commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said The commission will announce Thursday when it will have its next meeting We are trying to coordinate the commissioners schedules to see when they can meet next week Prosper said The votes are being delayed as a result of the closure of the commissions offices Tuesday after terrorist attacks on the East Coast Tuesdays deadline to file comments on the DWR revenue requirement order has also been extended to Wednesday at pm PDT GMT Thursday The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the states investorowned utilities since January CPUC votes on the proposed decisions are crucial to the states plans to sell a record billion in revenue bonds later this autumn The bonds will be used to repay about billion borrowed from the states general fund and a billion bridge loan for power purchases State Treasurer Philip Angelides has said he will comment on any revision to the bond sales timetable after the CPUC takes all necessary votes The postponement of bondrelated votes Thursday will also affect items dealing with the suspension of retail choice of electricity providers and servicing agreements between the utilities and the DWR A vote on a rate hike for customers of Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric is also postponed Calif Lawmakers Call For Federal Probe Of State Pwr Mkt By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A dozen California Republican state senators called for a federal investigation into the states grid operator and power buying arm claiming the agencies may be manipulating the wholesale electricity market by understating the states power needs in order to obtain a higher price outofmarket for its excess supply according to a letter sent to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The letter signed by Senate Republican Minority Leader Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga Sen Ray Haynes RRiverside and others in the minority leadership alleges the California Independent System Operator has understated the states daily power needs in order to allow the Department of Water Resources to get a higher price for its excess electricity through outofmarket calls The ISO maintains reliability of the grid and operates the spot market in California The DWR is the agency that has been buying electricity since January in lieu of the states struggling utilities and signed billion in longterm power pacts The ISO has denied the allegations but the agency has come under fire for what some describe as market manipulation It could be argued that a higher price for excess electricity is needed for political reasons because DWR has been selling power for a low as per megawatthour after entering into longterm contracts averaging per megawatthour the letter sent to FERC Chairman Pat Wood An aide to Wood said the letter has not yet been reviewed by the agency The letter claims the ISO made numerous outofmarket sales for DWR power especially in June Evidence indicates that the outofmarket calls especially those in June of were many times larger than load imbalances ISO Confirms Market Dysfunctional Last week an ISO spokesman said the agencys market was not working as it was designed to refusing to elaborate The ISO may also be in violation of its federal regulations requiring it to make the cheapest power available in the state before turning to more expensive supplies Fishman confirmed that the ISO has at times taken bids out of sequence turning to higher priced power because the state can obtain the more expensive power quicker In August the ISO confirmed that it reduced power at lowcost power plants possibly to allow the DWR to keep its excess supply The states Big Five power generators also filed a complaint with FERC saying the ISO has failed to pay the companies billion for electricity supplied since midJanuary State regulators delay decision on power rate agreement September SACRAMENTO State energy regulators said Wednesday theyll delay a vote on a plan that cedes the Public Utilities Commissions ratemaking authority to the state Department of Water Resources The PUC still plans to meet Thursday but the commissioners will choose a new date possibly for next week to vote on the plan said Terri Prosper PUC spokeswoman With most public offices closed Tuesday due to the terrorist attacks in Washington DC and New York many parties requested more time to file comments on the plan Prosper said That means PUC officials will also need additional time to review the comments she said The proposed agreement would let DWR pass on all power costs to customers without oversight by state regulators to ensure those costs are fair and reasonable The DWR has been purchasing power for customers of three major utilities since January when recordhigh wholesale energy costs brought the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy One of the utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co filed for Chapter bankruptcy in April The other two Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co are working with state officials on rescue plans that would let the utilities issue revenue bonds for their debts Critics of the DWR draft rate agreement which includes the utilities and several consumer groups say the PUC plan would let the department raise customer rates to pay for energy costs It would prevent the PUC from reviewing energy costs or contracts to ensure they were reasonable DWR officials said they need that guarantee to attract investors when they sell billion in revenue bonds this fall Ratepayers will pay off those bonds over years and state officials say a solid revenue stream could help keep interest low State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs Energy With one week left in the legislative session lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how California will recoup its expenditures during power crisis After a summer of delays California regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities The energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis The state needs to recoup more than billion that it has spent on power and it has signed billion in longterm electricity contracts Final plans for meeting these financial obligationsand spreading the pain of paying them offhave been debated for months But the decision time has come Legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on Friday and the state Public Utilities Commission is under pressure to act on several longpending measures at a meeting on Thursday Whats before the state both at the PUC and the Legislature is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come PUC President Loretta M Lynch said in an interview Are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power or are we going to rely on the state The PUC which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year now faces another tough choice Should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state Department of Water Resources an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts Or should it balk and jeopardize the states planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans Legislation on Related Issues Legislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues One seeks to repair the finances of Southern California Edison through a billion aid plan backed by Gov Gray Davis The other would limit the powers of the Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for million customers of Edison Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric since January The state law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power exempted the purchases from PUC reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges Now the department is seeking a formal agreement with the PUC that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered Critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future State officials say the PUC has little choice but to sign the agreement which they see as necessary to reassure Wall Street bankers that the Department of Water Resources will be able to repay billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs The money from those bonds will go in part to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power Top state officials including the governor and treasurer want the bond sale to go without a hitch but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months and threatened litigation could further delay it The urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used billion from the treasury and has taken out a billion loan to cover power costs State Treasurer Phil Angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early s People ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question What is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding he said Lynch one of three Davis appointees on the fivemember PUC finds herself in a particularly difficult position She sees the value of PUC reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases But Lynch said If we do not enter into a rate agreement the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund The thing I care about most she added is ensuring the general fund is repaid Earlier this month Lynch issued a draft decision that would have the PUC essentially rubberstamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the Department of Water Resources But she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state Sen John Burton DSan Francisco that the Davis administration opposes The bill would ensure that the PUC has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the Department of Water Resources and hold public hearings It would not however give the PUC the power to disallow department expenses To reassure Wall Street the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds At a PUC meeting last Thursday PUC commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque appointees of former Gov Pete Wilson voiced support for the Burton bill saying it would let the PUC shed additional light on the Department of Water Resources powerrelated expenditures The Davis administration opposes the bills present form but is seeking amendments One concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short bondholders would be paid before they are The bills passage could be a deal breaker for the bond sales said contractor Joseph Fichera a financial advisor to Davis At the least contentious debate surrounding energyrelated issues could drive up the price of floating bonds Fichera said Wall Street does not like risk Conflict implies risk So the more we create the more we are costing ratepayers he said The Legislature also is considering a bill that would allow Edison to sell bonds to pay off about threequarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis The utility would have to handle on its own about billion owed to large energy companies Consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill which they call a bailout The PUC on Thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the Department of Water Resources bonds One is a rate increase for SDGE customers Another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets an organization that includes many large California businesses said its members would be forced to sue if the PUC goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers But the most controversial item has been the proposed PUC agreement with the Department of Water Resources Consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the departments contracts and revenue requirements The plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers money said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Secrecy in DWR leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates Concerns about the Department of Water Resources lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments Energy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest Critics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of million in July although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with longterm power contracts And the departments projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures PGE Threatens to Sue Over Revenue The utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years If the PUC does not provide for that lawsuits could be coming PGE which already is in bankruptcy has threatened to sue if the Department of Water Resources revenue requirement doesnt leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in March PGE recently asked a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to require the Department of Water Resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements The company has reacted angrily to a draft PUC decision to shift million of the states cost of buying power from Edison to PGE saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against PGE customers Davis aides have defended the Department of Water Resources and its power purchases saying the departments longterm contracts helped cool the energy crisis They look overpriced now Fichera said But four months ago they were underpriced compared with the spot market They are an insurance policy against market volatility Having the PUC review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose Fichera said because the contracts already are in place You cant break contracts he said Youve got to pay them Even some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the Department of Water Resources performance to date One reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage Another reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis We all have hindsight said PUC Commissioner Bilas When DWR entered into contracts the state was over the barrel Now we can say that they are not as good as the department thought and that DWR does a lousy job of negotiating contracts But thats unfair Embedded Picture Metafile Embedded Picture Metafile

Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP State lawmakers prepared to rush through hundreds of measures in the remaining two days of the legislative session but one massive issue remained unsolved Thursday AP if and how the state will help Southern California Edison avoid bankruptcy By Thursday afternoon the Senate had done little to consider the Assemblys revision of a plan the Senate passed in July Without a Senate vote the rescue plan will die and leave Edison faced with bankruptcy Without a rescue we have every indication from Edison that theyll file for bankruptcy said Steve Maviglio the spokesman for Gov Gray Davis who negotiated a deal with Edison in April That deal allows the utility to issue revenue bonds backed by customer bills to pay most of its billion in debts It also gives the state an option to buy the utilitys transmission grid for about billion and hold development rights on more than acres of Edison land The Legislature must approve the deal by the time it adjourns Friday Lawmakers are also in a special session devoted to energy issues which could last longer than the regular session The states other large utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co filed for Chapter bankruptcy in April after amassing about billion due to last years skyhigh electricity costs Edison says it has accrued billion in debts Now the Senate has an altered version of Davis deal but it appears unlikely to pass it The bill currently allows Edison to sell billion in bonds Instead senators could gut and amend an Assembly measure reverting the deal to something closer to the version they sent the Assembly In that bill by Sen Richard Polanco DLos Angeles the utilitys bond issue would be capped at billion and the states option to buy the grid would be for the lines book value Edison opposed that deal saying it would not return them to financial solvency Senate President Pro Tem John Burton a San Francisco Democrat has been reluctant to pass an Edison deal Maviglio said the governors staff was trying to work with Burtons to come up with something Were ready and willing to meet when he is Maviglio said The Senate Energy Committee which could meet Thursday evening is considering amending an Assembly bill already in their house That bill would have to be approved by the energy and fiscal committees then sent to the floor for a vote by the full Senate If that happens theres nothing we can do said Assembly Republican spokeswoman Dana ODonnell Its coming back for concurrence That means we cant amend it we can only either vote on it or not vote on it Consumer groups opposed the bill approved by the Assembly last week Were working pretty hard to prevent them from doing anything said consumer advocate Doug Heller with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights That organization has promised to mount a ballot measure to reverse any Edison rescue deal approved by the Legislature Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September SACRAMENTO Enron Corp agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committees quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt In June the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into recordhigh prices in the states wholesale electricity market Enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected The judge agreed however that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the select committee said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators With that agreement Dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt He asked Sen John Burton DSan Francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against Enron for each day they didnt comply with the subpoena The daily fines would start at doubling each day for days Then the company would be fined million a day Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them But Dennis Murphy a lawyer for the select committee said Enron didnt tell investigators where the depository was located The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case he said Weve been trying to get into the depository for a week They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said Kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents The two parties havent met since the judge ordered the protective order and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the orders details Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order Sen Ross Johnson RIrvine said Dunns push to have Enron found in contempt smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate A contempt finding against Mirant Corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committees investigators If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron it will be the first time since when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state California lawmakers face largest issue hundreds of bills on final day of session State lawmakers faced a mammoth task on the final day of the legislative session as they tackle a rescue plan for Southern California Edison and hundreds of bills to complete by a midnight deadline The terrorist attacks on Tuesday forced lawmakers to skip a full day of proceedings creating an even busier final day that could possibly drag into Saturday During a marathon session Thursday and early Friday lawmakers redrew their own district lines approved twin handgun license bills and a measure allowing instate college tuition for certain immigrants Lawmakers still have to consider another version of Gov Gray Davis plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy The latest plan would let the utility issue billion in bonds leaving the company with billion in debt Without a rescue we have every indication from Edison that theyll file for bankruptcy said Steve Maviglio the spokesman for Davis The cashstrapped utility and Pacific Gas and Electric say theyve lost nearly billion since June to high wholesale prices the states electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers PGE filed for federal bankruptcy protection April Another top priority of the Legislature was redrawing district lines to reflect population changes reported in Census The Assembly and Senate approved district plans for themselves and Congress sending them to Davis for his approval Westerners look to windmills as possible saviors of a way of life Wash AP Like many ranchers facing pressure from developers Shirley Hindman worries that one day she might have to break up her Nine Mile Ranch one of the largest spreads in the Walla Walla Valley That would make me sick she says But now she and her father Billy have found another way to protect their acres of sagebrushcovered hills and canyonland The answer has come in the wind something we have plenty of she says And something also in growing demand Soon the ridgelines across Highway from Hindmans corrals will be dotted by windmills By next year Hindman and several other property owners including a nearby college expect to be landlords to the worlds largest wind farm Along southeastern Washington and into neighboring Oregon Danishbuilt windmills sleek white towers feet high with rotors feet across will churn out enough power for families served by Pacificorp one of the Northwests leading electric utilities Nearly of the wind turbines already are producing Gravel roads and concrete slabs for the others are in place It will help us keep Nine Mile It will help us sustain a way of life says Hugh Preston Ms Hindmans husband More than just an economic hedge for farmers and ranchers wind farms across the West and upper Midwest are emerging as a growing part of the nations electricity picture Major projects are operating or earmarked for completion within a year in Texas Montana Minnesota Kansas and Nevada While windmills still account for only a fraction of percent of the electricity produced in the United States they no longer are the exotic playthings of a few dreamers Increasingly bigtime players are showing interest in wind to supplement fossil fuelpowered electricity plants nuclear reactors and hydroelectric dams Wind is a technology thats now reliable and proven says Robert Morrison vice president for renewable business development at FPL Energy the Floridabased company building the megawatt OregonWashington project The cost of generating electricity from wind has declined from cents a kilowatthour years ago to to cents a kilowatt hour in todays larger projects says the industry Thats competitive with natural gas Suddenly this stuff is economical says Morrison whose company has other wind projects under way or being planned in a halfdozen states including Texas Kansas and Wisconsin Other emerging players include Enron the giant Houstonbased energy conglomerate and the governments Bonneville Power Administration which this year sought billion worth of wind energy projects and received more bids than expected The response blew us away said George Darr Bonnevilles manager for renewable resources Some of the projects will begin operating late next year Windmills now account for only about megawatts of generating capacity nationwide but the production is expected almost to double by the end of to provide enough electricity for million households The industry anticipates that in two decades wind power will grow to megawatts and account for percent of the countrys electricity In comparison nuclear power currently provides about percent of US electricity coalfired plants percent Winds sudden popularity has astounded even its biggest boosters We are in a boom year says Randall Swisher executive director of the American Wind Energy Association the industrys trade group in Washington DC We are expecting huge growth especially in the West That is good news for David Bittersdorf president of NRG Systems Inc a Vermont company that makes windmeasuring devices Weve grown percent this year he says His company which had million in sales expects business to quadruple over the next five years For the Hindman family at Nine Mile Ranch turbines rising from the scrub mean cash in the bank while not interfering with their head of cattle Typically farmers and ranchers involved in such lease arrangements get about a year per turbine Wind is a very lucrative crop for farmers says Bill Clemens president of the chamber of commerce in nearby Walla Walla The windmills are a real curiosity and may even add to the valleys tourist trade he said Ironically the region does not provide the most ideal locations for wind power What some call the Saudi Arabia of wind stretches from eastern Montana and the Dakotas through Nebraska Kansas and into Texas a region with enough wind potential to power the nation according to the Energy Department James Dehlsen an early wind energy pioneer dreams of putting together a massive wind complex of turbines stretching over miles of prairie in South Dakota It would be times as large as the WashingtonOregon project and produce a staggering megawatts of electricity Were at the early stages of the project said Dehlsen founder of the Zond Corp a US wind turbine manufacturer that has since been bought by Enron But he said he already has a commitments from farmers for use of acres Edisons bailout down to the wire By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Sept Today could be judgment day for Southern California Edison The drive to dig the states secondlargest power company out of its financial hole has reached its final sleepdeprived hours Sometime before the Legislature adjourns late tonight or early Saturday a billionplus deal could be struck in an effort to keep Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy An Edison rescue could lock Southern California businesses into rates higher than residents pay It could indirectly drive up residential rates statewide by freeing big businesses to strike private deals for electricity leaving small consumers to pay off the states costly wholesale power contracts And it could still fail to solve Edisons financial problems some creditors warn that the utility needs at least billion more to sidestep bankruptcy But some including Gov Gray Davis believe it is the best way out of a monthold energy quandary that began when wholesale prices soared so high that Edison could not pay them while prices it charged consumers were frozen Consumer groups argued that Edison and its parent company were legally obligated by deregulation to dig into past profits to cover the gap Edison disagreed Since then Davis has put his prestige on the line with a plan to rescue Edison which he unveiled three days after PGE filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in April Were not doing this for Edison the governor said in a press release when an Assembly version of the rescue package passed last week Were doing it for ourselves so we can get people who really understand how to buy power back into the power buying business Many consumer groups and some lawmakers say bankruptcy courts can best unravel Edisons finances They argue that the best thing the Legislature could do is nothing Some lobbyists give any Edison pact a chance of emerging before the weekend Edison officials have said repeatedly that the companys many creditors are likely to petition the courts to force it into bankruptcy if no deal is reached by the Legislatures close They say that could mean lowerquality electric service in the long run Meanwhile the terms of any deal have become caught up in the rush toward adjournment with its hallway conferences meetings late into the night and constant trades among interest groups and legislative leaders When you wait until the last few days of the session this is subject to all sorts of issues that are totally unrelated said DJ Smith a lobbyist for large electricity users By Thursday one key piece of the debate had come down to whether Edison should get billion or billion from business customers and how large a business would have to be before it kicks into the Edison rescue This may live and die over an apocryphal Rosies Dry Cleaners said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group That has kind of become a symbol here over whos going to have to pay for this bailout but Im not actually sure this is the most important issue Large business groups are lobbying for a big pool of midsize power users to pay off the billion or billion through extra charges on their electric bills Senate President Pro Tem John Burton had initially urged that only the largest power users should pay A compromise figure emerged Thursday but could change again as the measure is amended Also in question is how much other energy legislation might be wrapped into a final deal to win votes or allies At various times provisions calling for utilities statewide to sell a set amount of renewable power have been included as sweeteners for the environmentally minded So have provisions that would let businesses sidestep costly longterm state contracts by generating their own electricity or by signing up with other suppliers The clock is running out said Chriss Street of Street Asset Management which is advising a committee of Edison creditors The real crunch time for all of these negotiations is going to be in the last hours Street said the Legislature is avoiding the true issue by refusing to authorize a billion to billion deal that he said is needed to fully pay all creditors Without the higher amount he said Edison creditors might well force a bankruptcy believing they could get a better deal in court

Tribune Sept Group to Defend Ads Criticizing Davis LA Times September DavisBurton feud swirls over Edison bailout By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept The legislative session ended Friday with a dramatic standoff between two of the states most powerful Democrats The feud between Gov Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton remained the talk of the Capitol on Monday How they resolve the intraparty dispute will have a significant effect on whether California saves the states secondlargest utility from bankruptcy Both the governor and Burton said they intend to negotiate before they bring lawmakers back sometime in early October Otherwise Burton said it might be incumbent upon people to show up on the first day and recess For now the relationship between the state Senate and the governor is strained owing partly to what some lawmakers perceived as an insult from Davis at the end of the session At issue is Davis plan to have the state help Southern California Edison reduce its debt The Senate opposes the governors plan fearing that it would punish too many small customers We passed a bill it was a lot cleaner bill and a better bill for the people of the state of California than the one that was sent back to us that the administration wanted us to vote for Burton said Monday Davis meanwhile has portrayed his plan as the only way to remove the state from the powerbuying business and prevent a second utility bankruptcy His spokesman Steven Maviglio said the governor is risking political capital to pass a deal This is an extremely unpopular bill Maviglio said Sometimes youve got to do whats right and not whats popular Over the weekend Burton said repeatedly that the Davis plan only had seven Senate votes out of the required In a week marked by the national tragedy of terrorist attacks on the East Coast the governors lastminute lobbying was not enough Sen John Vasconcellos DSanta Clara said he received calls from Edison International Chairman John Bryson Davis energy adviser Michael Peevey and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher on behalf of the Edison plan all on Friday Im not going to come back in session to twiddle my thumbs if people are going to jam me Vasconcellos said With the Edison plan doomed in the Senate Davis Saturday told legislators that he would call them back in two weeks In a statement Davis said he was proud of the work done by the Assembly but unfortunately the Senate has not gotten the job done Some Senate lawmakers perceived that as an insult to their work particularly since the governors statement came at the end of a hour workday Burton called those remarks a shameful thing Maviglio pointed to two Senate actions that upset the governor In one instance Friday Davis met with Burton but was rebuffed The governor made a personal appeal to him and said I need this Maviglio said And that was rejected Meanwhile Davis was particularly incensed that the Senate passed a resolution that would have ended Californias state of emergency and the governors emergency powers Burton said Monday that some senators were concerned that Davis would use his sweeping powers when lawmakers were out of town The Assembly eventually killed the resolution Caught unaware the governor took it as an affront You know they spit in our eye Maviglio said Its not surprising that the governor said the simple fact that the Senate failed to act Davis advisers memo stirs a furor A threat to quickly expose certain Riordan donors is called extortion By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published Sept Gov Gray Davis top political adviser has sent an unusual memo to of the governors major contributors warning that any large donations they make to Republican challenger Richard Riordan will be disclosed during the coming weeks under new campaign finance rules The letter which was written by Garry South and mailed last week has triggered allegations of abuse of power and blackmail from Davis GOP opponents The letter has also provided voters a brief glimpse of the political mudslinging they can expect should Riordan the former mayor of Los Angeles officially declare his candidacy for the governors job Riordan who has been campaigning informally for the last few months is expected to announce his gubernatorial bid in mid to late October Exactly one month from today the whole world will know who has contributed to Riordan in the last three months and how much says the letter dated Sept Contrary to the impression being left with some potential donors the Riordan campaigns fund raising is going to be instantly transparent South argues that the onepage letter was intended to inform donors that the Riordan campaign which may have tried to solicit money from them has given out incorrect information about campaign finance disclosure deadlines We had been getting reports back that Riordan was calling our major donors trying to raise money South said Some were being led to believe that if they made contributions nobody would know about it for months Addressing the letter to friends and supporters of Governor Davis South told them that the early primary election on March has accelerated the deadlines for campaign finance disclosure statements This year he wrote the next disclosure report will be due Oct In past years when primaries were held at a later date Jan was the deadline The letter also explains that a recent bill signed by Davis SB requires statewide candidates and ballot measure committees to disclose within days contributions of at least received more than days before an election Officials from Riordans campaign however dont believe Souths motives were pure Riordan spokesman Dan Schnur said the letter is an abuse of power Its clearly a notveryveiled threat designed to prevent past Davis donors from giving money to Riordan he said Because Davis is considered a probusiness Democrat who raises money in the business community some of the donors interested in supporting Riordan likely have also given money to Davis Schnur said We have heard from several donors and potential donors who have received the letter he said Theyre outraged Campaign officials for Secretary of State Bill Jones another Republican gubernatorial hopeful also spoke out against the letter Jones spokeswoman Beth Miller labeled the memo blackmail and intimidation She said the letter seems to imply that the governor will take revenge on anyone who gives to Riordan The timing of the letter is particularly important she said It was sent just before Davis entered the intense monthlong billsigning period that ends Oct Its fair to say it borders on extortion Miller said The language of this letter is blackmail Do it and youll pay the consequences Its especially astounding that it comes during billsigning Miller said Jones probably will ask the Fair Political Practices Commission to review the letter South denied the allegations of blackmail saying the letter was not a threat He added however that its his job to run the governors campaign and to dissuade donors from giving to other candidates If someone gets that memo and says Im not going to give Riordan because its going to show up on a report days later more power to me South said Robert Stern president of the Center for Governmental Studies said the letter is typical of South who plays hardball but isnt illegal In fact Stern noted Davis is going to be affected by the same upcoming campaign finance deadlines that will force Riordan to disclose his contributions Its transparent for everybody Stern said Indeed both Riordan and Davis have had to disclose recent contributions of more than as required by SB Among Riordans contributors was Stockton developer Alex Spanos who gave on Sept Among those who gave to Davis was the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians which donated on Sept Burton No special session necessary for energy issues By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS September SACRAMENTO Consumer groups and the Senates top Democrat said Monday theres no need for an extra legislative attempt to save beleaguered Southern California Edison from bankruptcy Although the Assembly voted to let Edison sell billion in bonds to pay off part of its billion debt Senate Leader John Burton said he didnt bring it up for a vote in his house as the Legislature prepared to adjourn because not enough senators would vote for it Gov Gray Davis promptly announced he would call the years third extraordinary legislative session so the Legislature could again attempt to craft a rescue plan for Edison Theres no reason to come back and stay through a third fourth fifth or sixth special session unless theres a deal Burton said Monday People arent going to vote for something that they think is morally wrong and politically dangerous for them Several senators tried to write a lessgenerous version of the Assembly plan but Edison officials said that wouldnt help them said Burton a San Francisco Democrat Members felt that they didnt want to vote for a bill that helped Edison that Edison didnt want The utility amassed billion in debt from high wholesale prices last year Without a statebacked rescue the company says it will have no choice but to follow Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy Davis announced in April that he had negotiated a plan with Edison to buy the utilitys transmission lines and let the company issue revenue bonds backed by consumers to pay its debts Lawmakers worked on several incarnations of the deal since then but couldnt reconcile the different versions that passed each house The third legislative session would deal exclusively with Edison said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio Assembly and Senate leaders would set the date for the session to start An Edisononly session Maviglio said will force the Senate to focus on only that issue The bottom line is that it has to be legislation that gets the state out of the power business and gets Edison solvent Because the Assembly didnt adjourn the second extraordinary session on energy the governor would have to call a third session to compel lawmakers to return to the capital If the governor does that Burton says hell immediately adjourn it I dont know what the Legislature can do Whatever we want to do the Edison people say it isnt enough It isnt enough They want a flat bailout Burton said The Assembly approved a drastically changed version of the Senate bill adding million to the utilitys bonding limit and including provisions to encourage renewable energy and limit cash transfers from the utility to the parent company We sent a bill to the Senate one to accomplish one of the objectives of the legislation which is to put the utility back on its feet said Paul Hefner spokesman for Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys I dont know what more there is for us to do at this point Edison officials declined to comment Monday The company had opposed the Senates plan to let Edison sell billion in bonds saying that wouldnt keep them from bankruptcy Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield said Edison has cried wolf to lawmakers five times since January setting deadlines by which it said it would file for bankruptcy Now of course they said that they can wait until Oct I dont think Edison has much credibility with the legislators at this point said Rosenfield executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights His organization has promised a ballot measure to overturn any legislation that helps the utility State power regulators to investigate Edisons safety record By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS September SAN FRANCISCO California power regulators are launching an investigation into Southern California Edisons safety record citing safety violations over three years The Public Utilities Commissions consumer services division has linked accidents to these alleged violations tracked between and Five of which resulted in deaths the PUC announced late Monday The PUC will look into Edisons compliance with state Public Utilities Code provisions and commission orders on construction operation and maintenance for electric lines and facilities Safety in the provision of utility service is a top priority for the commission said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood in a written statement The public expects PUC safety requirements to be rigorously enforced and we will meet that expectation In a written statement Monday evening Edison said it has begun a comprehensive review and analysis of the allegations We continue to believe that our program is one of the best in the indudstry and with respect to reliability of service and to the safety of our customers and employees the company said The PUCs consumer services division wrote that it had sent notices to Edison about their alleged violations The divisions report suggests there may have been a significant number of injuries and fatalities that might have been prevented by compliance with safety standards The announcement comes just days after the state Senate refused to pass a plan backed by Gov Gray Davis to let Edison sell several billion dollars in bonds to help settle its debts Davis called the years third extraordinary legislative session so lawmakers again could try to craft a rescue plan for Edison Steve Maviglio a Davis spokesman said Monday that the investigation should not adversely affect Edisons chances of receiving financial help from the state Edison along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co has struggled with debt since last summer when electricity and natural gas prices shot up A rate freeze prevented them from recovering the extra costs from customers Group to Defend Ads Criticizing Davis By ALEXA HAUSSLER Associated Press Writer September AM PDT SACRAMENTO Calif A Washington DCbased taxpayer group that criticized Gov Gray Davis handling of the statewide energy crisis is now finding itself on the defensive A judge ruled on Monday that the American Taxpayers Alliance which ran television ads criticizing the governor must register as a political committee and identify its financial backers Basically American Taxpayers Alliance has to play by the same rules that everybody else has to play by said James Harrison a San Franciscobased attorney representing Davis reelection committee James Bopp an Indianabased attorney for the taxpayer group said Monday it will appeal the ruling He said the group is not a political committee The First Amendment fully protects the right of citizens to praise or criticize the conduct of public officials while in office Bopp said This ruling strikes at the heart of that right The group ran the ads for three weeks starting June The ads ended with the phrase Grayouts from Gray Davis referring to the states rolling blackouts The alliance is headed by Scott Reed a Republican strategist and the commercials were produced by consultants who helped produce ads for President Bushs presidential campaign Davis and other Democrats say the alliances contributors include electric power generators that have been accused of overcharging the state Davis sued in July claiming the group violated the states Political Reform Act by failing to register with the California secretary of state He argued that any group advocating for or against candidates must register But Bopp accused Davis of intending to punish harass or intimidate people who criticize him Davis is up for reelection in November His popularity slipped to its lowest point in the spring when state officials were predicting a serious summer power shortage But mild weather longterm contracts with energy suppliers and other conditions led to a blackoutfree summer and Davis approval rating is rebounding Still the energy crisis which forced the states largest utility into bankruptcy proceedings and caused an electricity rate increase and rolling blackouts earlier in the year is likely to be a key issue in next years race

Warnings of Blackouts SF The Examiner Fri Legislature hangs Davis out to dry By Nick Driver Of The Examiner Staff Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov Gray Davis plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with one of their own The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San Diegoarea utility and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase PGE lines through bankruptcy proceedings And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his own transmission line deal A week ago Davis finally found a termlimited senator Richard Polanco DLos Angeles to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso n lines Now the governors office admits that talks will not proceed until the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edisons lines Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi s plan giving the state a fiveyear option to purchase all power lines for billion While a much lower price the bill would also lower Edisons debt by forcing power marketers to accept percent of the billion ow ed them Under the terms of that proposal the state would still have to loan Edison money around billion and would guarantee SoCal Edisons sale of a further billion in bonds The state would also receive a conservation easement on acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land As in the Davis bill SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively lowcost electricity for years from one of its power plants and force parent company Edison International to repay million in transfers A Republican plan labeled Plan R now making its way through the halls of the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister except it allows the state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build The Democratic bills sponsors Assemblymen John Dutra DFremont Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg believe they can persuade Edisons board of directors to approve their deal even though it is not as attractive as the governors offer Edison refused to comment on the plan Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge were trying a different strategy Wednesday The minority partys Plan R has not been introduced as official legislation but instead floated among Republicans a nd Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edisons only real alternative to bankruptcy and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern neighbor PGE in bankruptcy So far Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators charging high wholesale prices PGE declared bankruptcy April A governors office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all attention away from any dealmaking but that the two sides continued to me et frequently Another adviser Joe Fichera said there are lots of moving parts to the deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electrics transmission lines bu t that he continued to meet with company representatives including an allda y meeting Monday In San Diego a spokesman for SDGE referred all calls to t he governors office But the sponsor of the Davis bill Polanco is not one of the legislatures power brokers and most lawmakers said the billion memorandum of understanding is now in serious jeopardy A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos including the threat of an increase in blackouts The governor and business leaders have said the economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages rises Legislators policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne ed and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the state especially if the bulk of them now owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co are still not for sale Critics such as Senate President John Burton DSan Francisco one of the bills strongest proponents three months ago now say the state should not be in the business of replacing or upgrading dilapidated lines at a cost of upwards of billion Others see the state as the best candidate for improving a system long neglected by utilities State ownership of the transmission grid would be a better way to help gri d problems such as connecting wind generators said Joe Ito an energy analy st at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories It has been extremely difficult to buil d new transmission capacity over the last years especially into bottlenec ks like San Francisco Bush unveiled his Energy Plan last week including a key plank that would allow the federal government to use eminent domain to purchase private land and build more transmission lines Bush arrives Tuesday for talks with Davi s on this and other solutions to the energy

reached at or For seniors the heat can kill doctors warn By Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert Bee Staff Writers Published May As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a countertheme Heat can kill And most often it kills seniors Year after year heat waves around the United States are deadlier than hurricanes or floods tornadoes or earthquakes according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration In California a single Los Angeles heat wave killed more than twice as man y people as the San Francisco quake according to research assembled by the state Energy Commission And national weather disaster statistics show that more than twothirds of those felled by the heat in recent years were age or older Heat and the elderly are not a good combination said Dr Cheryl Phillips a Sutter Medical Group geriatrician Its a real concern this year As people age their bodies begin to lose the ability to sense when they ar e thirsty or to bounce back quickly from dehydration she said The very people who are most vulnerable to heat also often have a tradition of thrift and public spiritedness that might lead them to use less electricity than is safe doctors and energy officials fear Their conservation ethic was from the s and s when we didnt have a ir conditioning as prevalent as we do now and they were much younger So they probably feel like I can do this this is important and theyre not recognizing the change in their body said Claudia Chandler of the Energy Commission The California Department of Aging is concerned enough that it will soon begin a special outreach to warn seniors about the dangers of hot temperatures especially when air conditioning may be low or turned off because of high utility bills In a public education campaign aimed at the million Californians who ar e or older officials will preach conservation preparedness for outages a nd the need for drinking eight glasses of water each day Relatively simple steps can keep people safe if they are alert to the danger Some are as obvious as staying out of the sun and moving less on the hottes t days Others are more arcane People of all ages need to be aware that certain medications including some antidepressants and diuretics can increase their sensitivity to heat So can too much alcohol too much weight heart disease and other illnesses Allergies and heart problems underscore Margueritte Ranneys juggling act At she has already had to refinance her house to keep up with rising bills on a fixed income She does her laundry with cold water shuts off unneeded appliances and opens the door each morning to cool her home But when the days heat builds Ranney faces a stark choice Its very ve ry rough she said but she puts her health first She closes up her twobedroom home and turns on her evaporative cooler If I had to turn off my cooler it would be pretty bad she said If I ha ve to turn it off I have problems People who want to cut back on air conditioning while still protecting thei r health should use portable fans at home spray themselves with small mister s and take cool breaks to an air conditioned movie theater or store And seniors especially should drink lots of water Dont wait until you re thirsty Drink constantly on hot days said Phillips Two heatmoderating mechanisms weaken with age she said and doctors still dont understand precisely why In some ways the human body is like a glass of salty water Sweat makes th e water level drop and the salt level rise and in young people two hormones aldosterone and angiotensin kick in to restore the balance Those hormones are the ones that signal to the brain dang Im thirsty said Phillips They also tell the kidneys to hold onto water But as people age their sensitivity to both hormones declines making it easier for seniors to get seriously dehydrated Then things can get even more dangerous because older bodies dont recover as quickly from dehydration The dizziness and confusion that come in later stages of overheating can trigger bonebreaking falls in a person who is already frail The good news is there isnt much danger of getting overheated during rolling blackouts or by setting a thermostat at degrees instead of said Phillips Im really not so worried about the power outages For an hour and a half people will do fine the doctor said Im worried about the power bills Elders on fixed incomes who have to decide between food and the power bill will say heck Im turning the air conditioner off Its a serious worry according to Gloria Jackson of Sacramento Countys Department of Health and Human Services About three or four seniors contact her each week because they are facing a cutoff of their utilities for unpaid bills said Jackson the countys liaison to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Struggling to pay high energy bills on Social Security or other fixed incomes the seniors end up owing from to in overdue bills she said A few have voluntarily had their PGE gas service disconnected so the y will have enough to pay SMUD for electricity With incomes of about a month seniors may pay rent of to an d then have to figure out how to pay for utilities prescriptions and food Some of them are borrowing money to pay their utilities Jackson said Others have pawned jewelry Im very worried about the coming summer Jackson said Barbara Gillogly coordinator of gerontology programs at American River College encouraged neighbors and relatives to check regularly on older people who are living alone

incredibly stressed state she recalled H e was beet red his skin was fiery to touch and his eyes had started to glaze over The temperature of about degrees had been enough to nearly overcome her father and Chandler had to help him into a wading pool to bring his body temperature down It was really scary I almost lost my dad that day she said The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or House panel debates energy price controls By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau Published May WASHINGTON The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans staunch opposition to price controls An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned contentious and was defeated on a mostly partis an vote in subcommittee But Republicans sought a compromise after President Bush announced he would meet with California Gov Gray Davis during a trip to the state next week Davis has advocated price controls and has been outspoken in criticizing th e Bush administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for opposi ng them The committee talks also came as the possibility of Senate passage of price controls brightened considerably with the decision of Sen James Jeffords o f Vermont to bolt the Republican Party Jeffords move handed the chairmanshi p of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM who has already included price controls in his version of an energy bill Republicans on the House Energy Committee were optimistic a deal could be struck but Democrats said the talks were in the very early stages GOP members from California and other Western states were facing increased political pressure to negotiate We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement said Rep Billy Tauzin RLa the committee chairman But Rep Anna Eshoo DAtherton said of a deal Its in its infancy a premature baby at best Its been a good giveandtake Was a deal struck No Neither side would discuss the details of a potential compromise though there were some indications it might involve imposing a socalled costbase d rate structure on up to percent of the wholesale electricity power marketers sell allowing the remaining percent to be sold at competitive market rates William Massey one of two Democrat commissioners at the FERC said tempora ry federal price controls are legally justified and necessary to avert an impending energydriven economic disaster on the West Coast Massey has so far been overruled in his efforts to impose temporary price controls but two new commissioners whose nominations are on the Senate flo or could change the equation The question is should we ignore a tool that is in our toolbox and has bee n in our toolbox for years that we can use on a temporary basis lets say for the next months to get prices under control he said Wednesday The Bees Les Blumenthal can be reached at or Exec reacts hotly to California claim By Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON A top El Paso Corp executive strongly denounced as inaccura te and implausible allegations by California officials that the Houstonbased company willfully withheld supplying natural gas through its pipeline to bolster profits The company official testified yesterday before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative law judge examining charges that the Houstonbase d conglomerate cost California billions of dollars The company did not have a financial incentive to withhold pipeline capaci ty in order to increase natural gas prices in California said Ralph Eads president of El Paso Merchant Energy which markets natural gas on pipeline s from Texas and New Mexico into California Merchant is a division of El Paso Corp which operates a key pipeline that supplies about onesixth of Californias natural gas Eads is a corporate executive vice president He said that although Merchant earned more than million in pretax profits in selling natural gas in the past year the company lost potential ly hundreds of millions of dollars more by entering into longterm contracts under what is known as a hedging strategy During afternoon testimony yesterday Eads repeatedly denied suggestions by an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission that the company kept gas capacity out of the hands of other marketers to drive up profits between November and March The California PUC lawyer Harvey Morris suggested that Merchant failed to aggressively market its natural gas and knew that it would only use percent of capacity Not so said Eads We bought capacity to use it he testified In testimony filed with FERC Eads said The allegations made against Merchant by the California Public Utilities Commission and supporter interveners are not only inaccurate they are also implausible California officials have accused El Paso Corp and its gas marketing compa ny of using its marketing muscle to drive up the price of gas sold in Californ ia by more than billion Two financially troubled state utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison have joined in the states case against El Paso

Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO Californias biggest power users from factories to farm s now can sign up for even more programs that offer cheaper electricity in exchange for less power use potentially cutting the states energybuy ing costs by lowering demand The state Public Utilities Commission also decided Thursday to begin reexamining the calculation that determines which residential customers of the states two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent record rate increase Last year voluntary blackouts by socalled interruptible customers kept as much as megawatts on the states power grid enough electricity to power more than million homes By being first in line for blackouts or cutting use these customers also help managers of the states power grid leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases The PUC hopes even more customers will participate this year meaning less highpriced electricity the state would have to buy to keep homes and businesses humming Negawatts are our cheapest source of power said PUC Commissioner Richa rd Bilas The state already has paid billion to buy electricity for the customers of the states three largest utilities The PUC will allow big customers to sign up for more than one program to stretch the states meager supply of electricity One program promises not to subject the customers to rolling blackouts if they slash their power use by up to percent while blackouts are rolling through the rest of the state Another program offers customers cents for every kilowatt hour they don t use during one of a trio of fourhour blocks between am and pm The PUC also will reexamine how it determines baseline a varying level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated to determine if it is still accurate and fair since its last update nearly a decade ago It is time to conduct that review said Commissioner Jeff Brown adding that a new calculation for baseline would not be available until winter at earliest long after customers begin paying the biggest rate hike in California history Baseline is percent to percent of the average amount of electricity used by residential customers in the same climatic and geographical area I t provides a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge Customers are now charged progressively more when their electric us e rises above percent of their baseline Ratepayers throughout the state say baselines are unfair since they dont take household size or the growing number of electronic gadgets into accoun t However while changing the baseline may spare more customers it would als o make remaining customers pay even more Slater asks Sempra to purchase generators May San Diego County Supervisor Pam Slater is asking Sempra Energy to provide million for the purchase of portable generators to be used during rolling blackouts this summer Slaters request was made in a letter sent yesterday to Sempra President Steven Baum and comes one day after the Board of Supervisors turned down a similar request A coalition of businesses asked supervisors Tuesday to pay for the generators but supervisors rejected the request saying the county cannot legally spend taxpayers dollars on energy generation Slaters letter to Baum said that Sempra does not face that restriction Sh e added It is incumbent upon Sempra Energy to supply enough energy for the San Diego region to reduce the possibility of rolling blackouts A Sempra official said the company will not pay for the generators and said it already is spending billion on power plants and natural gas pipelines on the West Coast to address the energy crisis President will find Californians upset at his energy stance By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May When George W Bush arrives in California next week for the first time as president he will find a solid majority of residents who believe he is doi ng a bad job of dealing with the states mounting energy woes A new Field Poll also finds that Californians who were once willing to give Gov Gray Davis the benefit of the doubt now disapprove of the way he is handling the crisis as well The nonpartisan statewide public opinion survey asked Californians to rate how individuals or entities are doing on the energy front The strongly negative appraisal of Bush ranks up there with outofstate electricity generators public utilities and regulatory agencies that have long been portrayed as the villains in the crisis Its incredible to me that Bush is rated in that league said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll I think thats an ominous sign of the mood Californians are in visavis the federal government dragging its feet on providing any shortterm relief He said the numbers seem to signal that the Democratic portrayal of Bush as a captive of big oil and more sympathetic to corporate energy interests tha n consumers is taking hold with the public Its starting to stick he said It does seem to be an issue that the Republican administration is vulnerable on The Field Poll conducted telephone interviews with a representative sample of adult Californians between May and Sunday Statistically such a poll is considered accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points The poll found Californians are pessimistic about the prospects of a reliab le supply of electricity being guaranteed anytime soon On the average they said they expected the crisis to last more months which would take it beyond November when Davis faces a reelection bid Thats obviously something the Davis administration hopes would not play out said DiCamillo In January the Field Poll showed Davis energy efforts were favorably regarded by Californians At the time percent said Davis was doing a go od job managing the energy situation while percent critiqued his performan ce as fair and percent as poor Now only percent regard the governors handling of the situation favorably compared with percent who rate it as fair and percent as poor Californians appraisal of Bushs performance on the energy front is considerably more harsh with percent saying he is doing a poor job and only percent saying he is doing a good job Bush had not yet taken offi ce when the January poll was conducted Other entities ranked in order of their negative rating Private electric utilities percent outofstate energy providers percent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission percent California Public Utilities Commission percent Vice President Dick Cheney percent state Legislature percent Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham percent industrial and business energy consumers percent The only entity Californians regard positively for dealing with the electricity problems turns out to be Californians themselves Residential energy consumers were rated as doing a good job percent to percent fair and percent poor That is almost the reverse of January when residential users were rated only percent good percent fair and percent poor Its conservation said DiCamillo The public has changed its habits sin ce January They think theyre doing as good a job as can be expected but all the others are just not up to it POLL Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis May SAN FRANCISCO Over the past four months Californians have developed increasingly negative feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in Californias energy crisis according to a Field Poll released Thursday A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas Electrics bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provide service to its customers Fiftyseven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute a Sa n Franciscobased nonpartisan polling organization gave Californias private electric utilities a poor rating Thats more than the percent of respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January The same negative feelings held true for outofstate energy providers Fiftyfive percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poo r a noticeable increase from the percent of respondents who gave them a po or rating in January Specifically those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state The poll found that The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Commission a poor rating rose from percent in January to percent in May percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May as opposed percent in January percent gave Gov Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the states energy woes a sharp increase from percent who gave him a po or rating in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from respondents In May percent said FERC was doing a poor job as opposed to percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January Those surveyed were also asked if PGEs bankruptcy would make it more difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers and percen t said they thought it would The poll which questioned California adults between May and May has a margin of error of plus or minus percentage points the institute said California PUC to earmark more electricity for grid By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO State power regulators are considering expanding the men u of programs that offer cheaper energy to customers who voluntarily cut their power use Its part of an effort to muddle through an energystrapped summ er in California with a meager supply of megawatts The state Public Utilities Commission could also begin looking into whether baseline a level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated is accurate and fair In March the PUC released a package of socalled interruptible load programs which offer discounted electric bills to factories schools and other big users if they agree to be first in line for rolling blackouts By cutting their use these customers help managers of the states power gr id leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases Loretta Lynch PUC president said the commission hopes to boost participation by allowing customers who participated in interruptible programs earlier in the year to also join new programs Under one such program businesses could avoid surprise blackouts by opting for dimmed lights and reduced power during the duration of outages througho ut the state The PUC is also considering funding interruptible programs for the states three largest investorowned utilities as they go into effect rather than forcing utilities to wait for retroactive funding a year later The commission also plans to examine whether the PUC should change how residential customers baselines are calculated to better reflect household size and a spike in electronic gadgets Baseline is a certain amount of electricity guaranteed at the lowest price utilities charge Customers who exceed their baselines by more than percent are subject to rate hikes I think its clear that baselines were set too low and didnt reflect actu al electricity usage Lynch said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network warned that potentially changing baseline would simply push the rate hikes onto differe nt customers If you think about the rate increase as sort of a balloon if you push on it someplace its going to pop out somewhere else Spatt said Lynch said the commission would likely postpone many orders affecting vario us aspects of the natural gas industry in favor of meshing them together in a comprehensive gas strategy I dont think they anticipate any problems with natural gas this summer or winter Lynch said A PUC investigation into whether natural gas and electricity generators and sellers illegally drove up prices by withholding energy during times of highest demands continues What we saw was a pattern of individual behavior which all tracked around the same time which I believe contributed to the high prices Lynch said Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES California would get a little power and a lot of pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov Gray Davis that would pay owners of backup generators to produce electricity The proposal one of several options the governor is considering would pay for diesel power which at its dirtiest is times more polluting tha n the cleanest natural gas power plants when electricity supplies are stretc hed If backup generators were to be used it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we ar e in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators Th at would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garvey executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electri c grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the states power crunch began regional airquality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen a buil ding block of asthmainducing smog Davis Orders Tiered Warnings of Blackouts By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOIn a significant policy change aimed at minimizing busines s and consumer disruptions Gov Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a threetier blackout warning system Forecasts of blackouts will be issued hours beforehand Davis said General areas will be identified in warnings issued hours before likely outages Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu t he said Business executives police and consumers have complained that the current warning systemin which blackouts can come with less than minutes warningdoes not give them sufficient time to save information on computers shut down assembly lines safeguard traffic intersections and otherwise prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out In the past state grid operators only gave short notice because they often found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts They said they did not want to repeatedly alarm people Utility officials have said they feared that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to looters and burglars But crime has not been a problem during Californias six days of blackouts so far this year And with experts predicting dozens of days of forced outages this summer state and utility leaders say Californians are better off prepared If blackouts are going to occur Davis said there is no reason to keep the public in the dark We all deserve as much advance notice as possible Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio and television announcements Starting with June utility bills Southern California Edison customers will be given block numbers that allow them t o learn through the Edison Web site wwwscecom if they are scheduled for rotating blackouts on days of short supply Under the governors order Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said consumers can expect hour warnings about general areasSanta Monica or Santa Ana for examplethat might be targeted for hourlong blackouts At minutes before a blackout is triggered Bennett said the warnin gs delivered through radio television and the Internet will get much more precise For example he said One hour before well say Main Street in Santa Monica will be affected Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governors order by June And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear of blackout warnings they said the governors order will ultimately help the state avoid blackouts I think were going to save power potentially lives were going to help save jobs and Californias economy said Carl Guardino a member of t he board that oversees the California Independent System Operator which manag es of the states transmission system Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca who said he intends to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today For some the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the state is failing to solve the energy crisis It obviously says were surrendering to the electricity crisis said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Here weve arrived in the st century with all the electronics and we dont have the power to run them Utility spokesmen lauded the plan but said that much of the responsibility rests with CalISO which is the only entity that has the ability to track supplies If the ISO only gives us minutes warning our customers will get something less than minutes notice said John Nelson spokesman for Pacific Gas Electric As it works now CalISO informs utilities of pending blackouts The utility in turn informs county offices of emergency services Using computerized calling email and manual dialing the utilities also inform law enforcement major industrial users people on life support and other consumers for whom electricity is vital Nelson said Californians at large are expected to learn of the warnings through th e media and the CalISO Web site wwwcaisocom Also on Thursday Davis met with officials of Californias publicly owned utility districts and came away he said with promises that they wou ld sell excess power to the state at prices significantly lower than on the sp ot market Copyright Los Angeles Times PUC to Reassess Rate Hikes Energy State regulators vote to reexamine baselines used to determine how much customers will pay for power Consumers say allotments are too low By TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writer SAN FRANCISCONine days after structuring the largest electricity rat e increase in California history state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay If the indicators are revised upward as most expect that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases The energy crisis put the esoteric term baseline on the minds of millions of utility customers During recent hearings on a billion rat e increase the California Public Utilities Commission heard a chorus of complaints from consumers who said their baseline was unrealistically low exposing them unfairly to the rate hike The most visible and controversial issue other than the overall increase ordered was the methodology used to spread the increased revenue requirement to residential customers the PUC said in voting unanimously t o reassess baselines On March the PUC approved rate increases for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co but exempted people in a lowincome program and customers consuming less than of their baseline which is to of average residential usage with allowances for climate and season But other customers will pay more depending on how much their consumption exceeds the baseline Reassessment of the baselines commissioners said will not be complet ed for the summer when new rate hikes go into full swing but it could be don e by winter Public hearings are scheduled for July Several commissioners acknowledged that an upward adjustment in baselines would bring in less money from utility customers and could create a funding shortfall for future power purchases There is no question the baseline is out of whack Commissioner Richard Bilas said later But if the revenue base falls where do you get the money Another rate increase This is the problem Thousands of consumers contacted the PUC about the last rate increase and hundreds complained about difficulty in achieving their baseline allotments even when they worked hard to conserve Baselines have been used to chart utility bills for the past quartercentury and they are periodically updated The levels vary by area and utility They are not adjusted by househol d size And critics say they do not accurately reflect power needs of homes with computers VCRs and microwaves We heard lots of customers complain its not fair said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for Toward Utility Rate Reform For example if you have lots of children who do not contribute income but use electricity you could be at a disadvantage Living below baseline may not be easy for many Spatt whose baseline for her San Francisco home is kilowatt hours goes so far as to dry her laundry on a clothesline but was slightly above of baseline in March Bilas home in Mendocino County has a baseline of about kilowatt hours and he says he consumes more than I dont know how anyone can live on the baseline he said But he added I have a hot tub I can turn off Copyright Los Angeles Times We Arent That Desperate Who hasnt stood at a street corner and recoiled from the noxious hot sooty exhaust spewing from a diesel bus or truck As bad as that is the exhaust of standby dieselfueled electric power generators is worse These smelly noisy machines are typically used by large businesses as emergency power backupsin earthquakes for instance They have virtually no polluti on controls and pose a health risk Under normal circumstances these generators might almost never be used But Gov Gray Davis is considering issuing an executive order to pay owners of these backup generators to run them constantly during Stage power alerts the highest alert before rolling blackouts This is an agonizing choice but the health riskthese generators pour out nitrogen dioxide a chief smog ingredienttips the balance against them A Davis spokesman say s the generators an estimated of them statewide would be run only as a last resort But if the aim was to avert blackouts they could be running f or hours at a time As The Times Gary Polakovic reported Thursday the generators are concentrated in areas including Los Angeles that already have severe air quality problems Environmentalists are protesting saying it would be better and more practical to pay companies to conserve power The governor also has a plan to cut from the bills of homeowners and businesses that reduce power use b y That program if pursued aggressively and in combination with other incentives now being offered would probably save as much power as the dies el generators could make To use these units in an attempt to stave off blackouts is too desperate and could cause more harm than it prevents Copyright Los Angeles Times Energy Crisis as Political Payback

Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for causing its own problems with a harebrained deregulation scheme and mocked the states power purchases and conservation programs It s been fun Now its time for our leaders to act like adults Davis and Bush always will have their political differences but the economies of both the state and the nation are endangered by Californias energy situation These leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible starting next week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California visit Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues Good start Lets hope the conversation is civil and that the civility spreads No matter how much California has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric power generation this year and next Usuall y the biggest targets of official and public wrath are the investorowned utilities such as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co But not this time because in the view of the state the utilities have bee n bled dry by the power generators stratospheric prices The state had to ta ke over the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and PGE Legal recourse should be pursued but the threatening rhetoric needs to subside State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White House for refusin g to use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholesale price controls And Davis is justifiably upset with Bush and with Cheney who said the only solution was to build more power plantsignoring the fact that the state i s building plants now with five more on the way and that the only way to control wholesale power rates is for Washington to cap them If the state hadnt bought the power the generators

Times An air of discontent over diesel backups Emissions rules ignore emergency generators Carolyn Said Chronicle Staff Writer Friday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Gov Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage electricity alerts as a way to stave of f blackouts And when blackouts do occur thousands of tractortrailersize generators will whir to life powering elevators and lights hospital equipment even assembly lines But that prospect has created major concerns Most of those industrial strength generators run on diesel oil a highly polluting fuel Because the y were intended for emergency use generators have escaped most environmental regulations Whats more they are likely to be called into service on the hottest smoggiest days of the year We think our air quality will be significantly worse this summer because o f diesel generators and peaker plants said Dan Jacobson a legislative advocate with the California Public Interest Research Group in Sacramento Identified as a toxic air contaminant by the state diesel fuel spews out nitrogen oxides which cause smog and acid rain It also emits particulate matter tiny soot and dust particles that can lodge in the lungs and may increase cancer risk Diesel generators produce as much as five times more pollution per megawatt hour of operation than even the oldest dirtiest coalfired power plants according to the California Air Resources Board They are times as polluting as modern gaspowered plants Practically every hospital large office building and apartment complex has a diesel generator standing by on the roof or parking lot in basements and boiler rooms The air board estimates there are diesel generators in California which produce an average of kilowatts enough to power essential functions for a sizable building But the number is probably much higher because businesses have stampeded to acquire generators over the past few months Generators operate in an urban setting close to where people work and live said Kenneth Lim supervising air quality engineer for the Bay Area Air Quality District If there were widespread rolling blackouts and thes e engines fired up all at the same time the impact could be very significant INCREASED CANCER RISK The California Air Resources Board said that operating a onemegawatt diese l engine for hours per year would increase cancer risk to nearby residen ts within one city block by in a million percent more than the existing cancer risk from exposure to ambient diesel fumes from trucks and buses Diesel generators largely avoided aircontrol laws because regulators assum ed they would be used only in case of an earthquake or other onceina bluemoon catastrophe Stage alerts and blackouts are likely to be everyday occurrences this summer Predictions range from hours to as high as hours of blackouts Most blackouts and Stage alerts will occur on hot days when air quality i s already poor Our worstcase scenario would be if we get into a two three or fourday episode where its really hot and really stagnant said Lucia Libretti spokeswoman for the air quality district Its bad enough smogwise on those days but when you add these dirty diese l backup generators to that mix its not going to be a pretty sight This summers predicted blackouts have brought a surge of business for generator companies GENERATING FAST SALES Caterpillar Inc the leading manufacturer of big generators said it has sold and rented more than megawatts of portable power on the West Coast so far this year enough to power almost million homes Thats seven time s as much backup power as Caterpillar provided to the region last year The customers include factories data centers banks utility substations and planned communities Everyone in the state is now claiming that they need a backup generator said CalPIRG lobbyist Jacobson Its not just the hospitals every busines s says they need a backup the rich people who live in Beverly Hills say they need it The door is open and everyone is trying to get one Small backup generators sold at Costco and Kmart that provide enough power for say a TV some lights and a blender run on gasoline which emits fewe r pollutants than diesel But most business commercial and agricultural users turn to diesel engines which can handle heavier loads kick on in seconds and provide a steady stream of power One positive about the rush to get new generators is that they pollute less than older models They arent blacksmokebillowing units like you might have seen or years ago said Jim Parker director of electric power for Caterpillar in Peoria Ill Diesel fumes from buses trucks tractors and construction equipment alread y surround us But their emissions are regulated unlike those from generator s DIRTY BUT ESSENTIAL Allen Schaeffer executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum which promotes the use of diesel fuel said it is important to consider the big picture You have to look at the full equation of increased risk to public health a nd safety from not having generators during blackouts he said Generators are a very important part of keeping life going especially essential critical services in California Consumer advocates and environmentalists were critical of Davis proposal t o turn on diesel generators when the power supply gets tight If the governor wants to do something dramatic why not call in the Nation al Guard to install solar panels

Pledging to take some of the uncertainty out of summer blackouts Gov Gray Davis outlined a plan yesterday to tell specific neighborhoods about probable rotating outages an hour in advance Davis earlywarning plan would also require utilities to give a hour warning of possible blackouts That would be followed by a hour warning of what neighborhoods would be hit Then one hour before the actual blackout the California Independent System Operator and utilities will notify the neighborhoods where power wil l probably be shut off Californians wouldnt have to have their utility block numbers committed to memory to know if blackouts are likely to hit their home office or child s day care center under Davis plan Details still need to be worked out but the plan envisions an outreach system whereby customers would be told through media alerts and other outreach including possible Web sites which geographic areas would be affected Currently only people who know which Pacific Gas and Electric Co block th ey live or work in know if they could be subjected to blackouts and media alerts come only minutes before the power goes off If blackouts are going to occur theres no reason to keep the public in t he dark Davis said A PGE representative said the company hopes to have more information available on its Web site as well as an number people can call to lear n what block they are in For several months weve been looking at ways to improve our customer notification process Ron Low PGE spokesman said We are looking at designing new programs and new ways to provide information on outages Businesses and consumers favor greater warning of impending blackouts The Democratic governor said such warnings would also allow law enforcement mor e time to put officers in the field particularly at busy intersections where traffic lights may go dark Davis said that within a few days he will issue an executive order requirin g that utilities begin to issue the warnings Administration officials said the Office of Emergency Services will work wi th the Public Utilities Commission and the utilities on the plan Utilities will also be responsible for providing law enforcement agencies with detailed maps identifying the locations of vulnerable populations including nursing homes schools and highrises as well as the location of facilities exempted from blackouts such as hospitals Within an hour of Davis announcement the California Independent System Operator board of directors approved a motion implementing the advanced notification system Elena Schmid vice president of corporate and strategic development for the ISO told the board it is important to remember that the key term in any early warning system is probable The ISO data showed that blackouts would not be needed percent of the ti me after a warning was given minutes in advance which was the staff recommendation A warning given minutes in advance as was adopted by the board would probably result in even more false alarms Schmid said Of the hours since January that blackouts appeared likely minutes out they were actually called times In other energyrelated matters yesterday Davis Said several municipal utilities including the city of Palo Alto and th e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power have agreed to supply their exce ss power to the state at prices below spot market prices Until now the municipal utilities had been selling their power at high prices leading some to say that they were gouging the state I believe the prices municipal utilities have charged the state during the past are unconscionable Davis said in a statement after the meeting The re was a strong commitment made from the municipal utilities to provide the state with excess power at lower reasonable costs whenever possible Threatened yesterday to sue if federal regulators dont limit the prices the state is being charged to buy electricity The threat came just days before President Bush

As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe

and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kicked out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected during the termlimit era A statewide initiative brave candidates ending term limits those are a ll things that will happen in the future Right now its time to tune in turn off and drop out Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer cast a critical eye at your own habits Turn off your appliances your lights your air conditioner and reduce your individual energy consumption Its much easier than it appears Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by switching off some lights converting to fluorescent light bulbs turning down the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip so that they truly are turned off Finally drop out of the power grid Look for other ways to power your home most notably solar power which is readily available Find other alternatives to highconsumption appliances such as clothesline s Drop out They cant gouge you if they cant get to you Simon can be seen pm Fridays on The Chronicles Peninsula This Week on cable Channel and at other

the energy crisis sapping his oncepotent popularity Go v Gray Davis could be a oneterm governor if the election were held now according to a Field Poll released today The survey indicates that voters by a point margin are not inclined to support Davis for reelection His approval rating which stood at an impressive percent in January has plummeted to percent In recent weeks Davis advisers have poohpoohed reports of the governors growing political weakness noting that the Republicans had mustered no strong candidate to oppose him But that may be changing In a Thursday interview with the Mercury News outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said he would love to tackle the problems confronting the state and promised a decision on his candidacy by the end of next month The Field Poll showed Davis and Riordan running neckandneck in a trial heat Poll director Mark DiCamillo said the most alarming news for Davis in the poll is that opposition to the governor is intense while his support is on ly lukewarm Just percent of those polled said they were very inclined to reelect him while percent said they were not at all inclined Bob Mulholland political adviser to the California Democratic Party shrugged off the survey noting that Gov Pete Wilson overcame a point deficit to challenger Kathleen Brown in to win by points Aides to Davis said they look forward once again to confounding critics of the governor who lagged behind his two primary opponents for months in Advisers unruffled Weve seen this movie before said Garry South Davis political advise r about the poll There nothing in there that makes me quake in my boots The Field Poll is the latest in a string of surveys that have given Republicans hope for retaking the corner office they controlled for year s before But despite the brisk sale of bumper stickers proclaiming Blackouts Gray Out the GOP still faces enormous obstacles in trying to unseat a savvy year career politician who has amassed a million campaign war chest for his reelection Associated Press file California Gov Gray Davis With Democrats claiming the bulk of statewide offices and majorities in bot h houses of the Legislature Republicans are at a low mark in terms of influence The energy deregulation bill at the root of the power problem wa s written by a Republican assemblyman and signed by former Republican Gov Pe te Wilson And it is Republicans polls show that the public most closely links with the greedy generators and powerrich Texans they blame for skyrocketing electricity bills Davis couldnt have picked a better political moment to fumble said University of CaliforniaIrvine political scientist Mark Petracca Despit e the quicksand hes in Republicans arent standing on solid ground either They are as culpable for the mess as Democrats are and besides that they dont have a leader To unseat an incumbent the rule of thumb is that a party needs an issue an d a candidate Republicans think they have their issue now A recent private poll showed that the energy crisis was the top concern of percent of Californians surveyed More telling was that education ranked second but w as only cited by percent a huge gap and a stunning drop for the issue tha t Davis has tried to make his top priority The real challenge The candidate part however is stickier Republicans start at a disadvanta ge in a state where voters overwhelmingly approve of abortion rights gun control and protecting the environment And at the moment the GOPs likeliest candidates for governor are Secretar y of State Bill Jones who suffers from a lack of name recognition and a poor track record at fundraising and William E Simon Jr a wealthy Los Angele s businessman and philanthropist who has no political experience and ties to the savings and loan and oil and gas industry that could hurt Davis is extremely vulnerable but neither of these individuals is the right candidate to defeat him said one GOP consultant who asked not to be identified Indeed the Field Poll shows Davis with doubledigit leads against either Simon or Jones Thats why the GOP flirted earlier this year with maverick choices such as movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger who ultimately said he is not interested More recently talk in GOP circles has turned to Riordan and former Stanfor d provost Condoleezza Rice Many Republican insiders doubt that Rice who garnered percent to Davis percent in the Field Poll would want to leave her position as President Bushs national security adviser But Riord an may be more interested Riordan fits Assemblyman Rod Pacheco RRiverside said Riordan is a moderate on social issues has broad name recognition can attract voters in the states urban districts and has proven leadership ability We need a new captain of the ship because this ship is heading toward the iceberg Pacheco said Dick Riordan is the only one who fits On Thursday Riordan told the Mercury News he will decide whether to run by the end of June Although he was looking forward to retirement and final ly learning to play golf he said his IrishCatholic conscience and his wifes support of whatever he decides could motivate him to run He said

regulators aim to keep more power on grid Posted at am PDT Friday May BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP State power regulators are busy devising ways to curb demand among the states heaviest users during peak periods From factories to farms Californias biggest power users are being encouraged to sign up for even more programs that offer cheaper electricity in exchange for less power use potentially cutting the states energybuying costs by lowering demand The state Public Utilities Commission also decided Thursday to begin reexamining the calculation that determines which residential customers of the states two largest utilities will see their bills rise under a recent record rate increase Last year voluntary blackouts by socalled interruptible customers kept as

power grid leave more power to residents and services necessary for public health and safety such as fire stations hospitals and military bases The PUC hopes even more customers will participate this year meaning less highpriced electricity the state would have to buy to keep homes and businesses humming Negawatts are our cheapest source of power said PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas The state already has paid billion to buy electricity for the customers of the states three largest utilities The PUC will allow big customers to sign up for more than one program to stretch the states meager supply of electricity One program promises not to subject the customers to rolling blackouts if they slash their power use by up to percent while blackouts are rolling through the rest of the state Another program offers customers cents for every kilowatt hour they don t use during one of a trio of fourhour blocks between am and pm The PUC also will reexamine how it determines baseline a varying level of residential power use upon which recent record rate hikes are allocated to determine if it is still accurate and fair since its last update nearly a decade ago It is time to conduct that review said Commissioner Jeff Brown adding that a new calculation for baseline would not be available until winter at earliest long after customers begin paying the biggest rate hike in California history Baseline is percent to percent of the average amount of electricity used by residential customers in the same climatic and geographical area I t provides a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge Customers are now charged progressively more when their electric us e rises above percent of their baseline Ratepayers throughout the state say baselines are unfair since they dont take household size or the growing number of electronic gadgets into accoun t However while changing the baseline may spare more customers it would als o make remaining customers pay even more PUC reviews baseline formula for setting rates Posted at pm PDT Thursday May BY MICHAEL BAZELEY Mercury News SAN FRANCISCO Responding to complaints from across the state energy regulators Thursday said they would examine whether adjustments are needed to the baseline levels that determine how much electricity residential users g et at a reduced price The formula behind the once obscure baseline has suddenly become crucial to millions of Californians Under a new state law customers who keep their electrical usage at or near the baseline levels on their bills are exempt from rate increases that take effect next month Now that the baseline is so important officials with the state Public Utilities Commission said they want to make sure it is applied as fairly as possible We want to move aggressively on this said Commissioner Jeff Brown The baseline was established two decades ago to guarantee households a minimum amount of electricity at the lowest possible price It is supposed to represent percent to percent of the average customers usage for each climate zone The current system accounts for differences in climate and seasons with residents in warmer climates given higher amounts of baselinepriced electricity The calculation has been criticized recently for not taking into account th e energy needs of homebased businesses or family and home size PUC officials said they would probably examine several issues including changing household characteristics and whether geographic boundaries should be redrawn Any changes also would affect the baseline for natural gas Commissioners cautioned against any heavyhanded tinkering with the baselin e State and utility officials already are counting on a certain amount of revenue from the new rate increase Shielding too many more customers from the increases ultimately could saddle other residential and business users with higher rates officials said This is not going to be a giveaway program Brown said State lawmakers also are mulling changes to the baseline law which was created in State Sen Jackie Speier DSan Mateo is carrying a bill that would order the PUC to take into consideration the presence of children when calculatin g a households baseline The Senate Energy Committee passed the bill Thursday on a vote It goes next to the Senate Appropriations Committee Also Thursday the PUC adopted a program that offers business customers dramatically cheaper electricity if they reduce usage during preset fourho ur blocks throughout the day That program comes on top of another program adopted earlier that exempts businesses from blackouts if they agree to reduce their usage by percent during highdemand periods The PUC postponed action on what to do about small independent power generators that are owed billion from the states two largest utilitie s Contact Michael Bazeley at or Regulators Companies pushed up price of power Posted at pm PDT Thursday May BRANDON BAILEY AND CHRIS OBRIEN Mercury News After months of investigation state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices Now they must decide whether those companies have done anything illegal State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence strongly suggests power companies acted illegally to drive up prices H e has said that he would love to put top energy executives in jail But he and other state regulators acknowledged they are still trying to decide what laws may have been broken Californians universally believe were getting ripped off that theres serious pricegouging Lockyer said Thursday However profittaking ca n be legal It depends on how you do it And how much you do it Lockyer said he is not ready to file charges and that it may be two months before he wraps up his investigation His office one of five state agencie s investigating the electricity industry along with two legislative committees is mulling over options ranging from criminal charges to a civi l lawsuit The legal issues are difficult agreed Gary Cohen chief counsel for th e states Public Utilities Commission which is coordinating its investigatio n with Lockyers office Finding the right legal theory and making it stick is challenging Power industry spokesmen deny any wrongdoing Reliant is participating in the market not manipulating the market said a statement issued this week by Reliant Energy which owns several plants in Southern California But PUC President Loretta Lynch said last week that her agency has evidence of power plant operators cutting back their output at certain times then ramping production up and down in what appeared to be an effort to driv e up prices by manipulating supplies Economists with the states Independent System Operator meanwhile say the ir studies show power suppliers used sophisticated bidding strategies to drive up prices and rake in billion more last year than they would have earned in a truly competitive market High selling prices After analyzing thousands of transactions in the states wholesale markets ISO experts concluded that power suppliers including some public utilities as well as private companies were able to sell electricity at prices highe r than production and fuel costs would seem to warrant But some antitrust experts say this isnt illegal unless theres a coordinated effort by more than one company which the power industry denies Other experts have noted a third type of gaming in which power supplie rs appeared to be taking advantage of localized bottlenecks in the states transmission grid either by producing too much power or too little and then earning a bonus when grid operators paid them to either scale back production or provide a little extra to help balance out supply and demand In one prominent example Oklahomabased Williams Energy recently paid million to settle a rare enforcement proceeding brought by the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission after state officials accused the company of profitin g from the shutdown of two power plants that served a local transmission area Williams however admitted no wrongdoing While industry representatives mostly blame high prices on short supplies some also say there is nothing wrong with reducing their output when prices are low and increasing production when prices go up as long as they meet a ll their contractual obligations to produce power Thats the way the market works said Gary Ackerman of the Western Powe r Trading Forum Weve designed a system where every hour power plant owners can make decisions about whether to produce or not produce given whatever excess capacity is not committed to someone else But some regulators while refusing to disclose specifics say their eviden ce suggests something more sinister Some generators appear to have withheld power during Stage alerts when t he states reserves were extremely limited said the PUCs Cohen For generators to withhold supply under those conditions is wrong he said And we believe its unlawful Straining equipment PUC officials say they are concerned that the ramping behavior does mor e than drive up prices in the short term They also suspect it puts extra strain on old equipment contributing to an abnormally high number of power plant breakdowns which in turn has made supply problems worse over the past year As part of its investigation the PUC has hired former utility workers to help inspect power plants and review operating records The attorney generals office has subpoenaed a mountain of records including generator data from an industry Web site that critics believe was used by power companies to share competitive information Investigators also have subpoenaed records of communication between control room operators who directly control the output of each generating unit an d energy traders who buy and sell that output for the parent company While Lockyer says criminal charges are possible some experts predict the state will file a civil lawsuit in part because there is a lower standard of proof in civil court No smoking gun Lawsuits alleging civil violations can bring fines and damage awards While some experts say its unlikely the state could recover anywhere near the billion in excess revenue that the ISO identified Lockyer noted that antitrust laws allow a judge to award triple damages Authorities acknowledge they have no smoking gun a document or meeti ng in which power companies agreed to coordinate their production or sales But if a company knows it can hold back power until prices rise because it knows that other companies will do the same the effect is the same as if t he companies had explicitly agreed not to undercut each others prices said state Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who is chairing a legislative investigating committee The San Francisco city attorneys office has filed a lawsuit joined by San ta Clara County that alleges both direct collusion and violation of the state s unfair business law I think under either test said Owen Clements chief of special litigation for San Francisco this is a very strong case Mercury News

is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ By Rick Stouffer The electricity supplydemand equation is simple Match supply to demand an d things are dandy Demand overwhelms supply build more supply Throughout the country but particularly in California there is no questio n more supply is mandatedNIMBY not in my backyard be hanged But what a bout the demand side of the issue What about getting customers involved in the solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system Negawatts nothing new Granted the concept of negawatts is nothing new it was coined roughly a quartercentury ago by the founder of the Boulderbased consulting firm E Source Amory Lovins Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get them through wattage rough spots from time to time All the existing independent system operators have actively considered demandside bids at one time or another according to Richard Rudden president of the consulting firm RJ Rudden Associates in Hauppauge NY But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio n Rather than a supply exchange aka an independent system operator put in place a demand exchange where customers could make a choice Do I produce widgets run my milling machines build product or take the power I would have used bid it out and see what happens Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being championed by an unlikely proponent Reliant Energy Inc The Houstonbased energy giant already has testified in Washington DC concerning the proposal has had meetings with key Western state government leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental groups The scorecard Thus far no one has laughed no one has walked away from th e conversationsno one has said no according to Reliants John H Stout senior vice president of asset commercialization Youre taking forced rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption with the customer that can take the outage doing so said Stout Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J oe Bartons Electricity Emergency Assistance bill but no big generator is pushing from the industry side like Reliant A demand exchange Like generators including Reliant bidding load into the independent syste m operator pool a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC If a particular system needed more power it would contact the clearinghouse which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped keeping in mind additional transmission charges Once the bids were identified the clearinghouse would contact the customer and its local control area The customer would interrupt and the host utili ty would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule One key to the programs success is that no one loses money The customer that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail supplier for what it didnt actually use and the customer would receive it s bid price times the megawatts curtailed minus its regular retail charges plus any payment to the transmission provider The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin said William Hogan a professor at Harvard Universitys John F Kennedy School of Government Another key to the Reliantchampioned negawatt program is that it is not seasonal it doesnt lock a potential megawattshedder into a longterm contract You can bid into the market every day said Stout It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions to be made how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement said Richard Tabors president of the Cambridge Massbased energy consulting firm Tabors Carmanis Associates As Tabors points out customers who sell back into the market obviously are doing so to play the margin to make money But their efforts also will hav e a serious impact on the spot market price Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesnt have to be produced Tabors reasoned That lowers the marginal cost the spot market cost It really comes down to what specific megawatts are worth to someon e and not worth to me Heavy users thrilled Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt proposal We think it is a well thoughtout program We feel customers hav e the right to buy power they should have the right to sell power and ought to be compensated like the generators said John Anderson executive director of ELCON the Electricity Consumers Resource Council which represents larg e industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice sound familiarallowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up its power This is voluntary You know when you will be shut down and thus you wont incur any damages said Anderson Many proposals tell the customer to cut usage but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down Command a nd control proposals treat everyone alikeand theyre not Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t he Reliant proposal with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe r Exchange Inc APX We have had discussions with Reliant were in the business of working wit h generators said John Melby vice president for North American marketing f or Santa Clara Califbased APX According to Melby APX represents more than half the demand response in th e California ISO He said the company could utilize key computer programs and systems previously developed to get the regionwide negawatt program up and running The down side There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla n Consultant Tabors for example pointed to the White House and the Bush administrations seeming preoccupation with supply Harvards Hogan said having the power available when needed was key while Reliants Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai l customers from selling load back into the wholesale market An obvious solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill however nothing is certain in such a divided Congress Thus Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program California Gov Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when he called a meeting of all Californias generators We thought he Davis generally liked the idea Stout said Next up on Reliants hit list is S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now Davis California energy conservation czar Weve already raised the issue with him Freeman but were looking to pl ug him in Stout said Reliant Energy to lower Calif peaking unit power prices New York May BridgeNews Reliant Energy said Thursday it will lower the price of its power bids from emergency limited run time peaking units t hat have environmental permit operating restrictions despite Reliants concerns that the state will deplete the available power of these plants too soon T he company had received criticism for recent high bid prices from these plants Reliant said in a release that it initiated this move in anticipation that local air quality control boards will lift restrictions on the run time for the units In letters sent to the South Coast Air Quality Management District the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Reliant said it resubmitted their request for a n extension on the run time limits of its emergency peaking units The company said the extensions would reduce the price of bids associated with these units from the to per megawatt hour level to to per megawatt hour Extensions also would help increase the available supply of power during power emergencies Currently the emergency peaking units are allowed to ru n for only a few days per year Reliant has recently been sharply criticized for bids from these plants Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer of Reliant Energy Wholesale Group said in a statement To show we are committed to working w ith all parties we are voluntarily reducing prices in the hopes that all the decision makers in California understand the need to lower restrictions dur ing times of emergencies In essence we are doing exactly what Governor Gray Davis has suggested Perkins said But if restrictions are not lowered we will run out of pow er from these units very quickly Reliants position has been that it has purposely bid the power from the units in question at prices designed to discourage premature use preserve availability for when the state is forced into emergencies because of low power reserves Extensions from the air quality control boards would allow Reliant Energy to operate these plants without penalty during emergency times and alleviat e the need to ration the units operating time But the company said it Reliant Energy intends to lower the prices of the megawatts produced at this plant in hopes that restrictions will be raised The units affected by this commitment include units at Reliant Energys Mandalay Etiwanda and Ellwood facilities Perkins said in his statement that the focus should be on the supply problem which he considers to be the root of the current power crisis in t he state It is astonishing that many decision makers continue to take the focus off of supply in the name of political finger pointing Perkins said A s a result many Californians still do not believe there is a serious supply problem Independent power generators have come under increasing scrutiny and are being investigated

Washington All Ears By LOWELL BERGMAN and JEFF GERTH The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Curtis Hebert Jr Washingtons top electricity regulator said he had bare ly settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L Lay the head of the nations largest electricity trader the Enron Corporation Mr Hebert chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that Mr Lay a close friend of President Bushs offered him a deal If he changed his views on electricity deregulation Enron would continue to support him in his new job Mr Hebert pronounced Abear recalled that Mr Lay prodded him to back a national push for retail competition in the energy business and a faster pa ce in opening up access to the electricity transmission grid to companies like Enron Mr Hebert said he refused the offer I was offended he recalled thou gh he said he knew of Mr Lays influence in Washington and thought the refusa l could put his job in jeopardy Asked about the conversation Mr Lay praised Mr Hebert but recalled it differently I remember him requesting Enrons support at the White House he said of Mr Hebert Mr Lay said he had very possibly discuss ed issues relating to the commissions authority over access to the grid As to Mr Heberts job Mr Lay said he told the chairman that the final decision on this was going to be the presidents certainly not ours Though the accounts of the discussion differ that it took place at all illustrates Enrons considerable influence in Washington especially at the commission the agency authorized to ensure fair prices in the nations wholesale electricity and natural gas markets Enrons main business Mr Lay has been one of Mr Bushs largest campaign contributors and no other energy company gave more money to Republican causes last year than Enron And it appears that Mr Hebert may soon be replaced as the commissions chairman according to Vice President Dick Cheney the Bush administration s point man on energy policy Mr Lay has weighed in on candidates for other commission posts supplying President Bushs chief personnel adviser with a list of preferred candidate s One Florida utility regulator who hoped for but did not receive an appointment as a commissioner said he had been interviewed by Mr Lay Mr Lay also had access to the team writing the White Houses energy report which embraces several initiatives and issues dear to Enron The reports recommendations include finding ways to give the federal government more power over electricity transmission networks a longtime go al of the company that was spelled out in a memorandum Mr Lay discussed durin g a minute meeting earlier this spring with Mr Cheney Mr Cheneys report includes much of what Mr Lay advocated during their meeting documents show Both men deny discussing commission personnel issu es during their talk But Mr Lay had an unusual opportunity to make his case about candidates in writing and in person to Mr Bushs personnel adviser Clay Johnson And when Mr Bush picked nominees to fill two vacant Republic an slots on the fivemember commission they both had the backing of Enron as well as other companies Mr Lay is not shy about voicing his opinion or flexing his political muscl e He has transformed the Houstonbased Enron from a sleepy naturalgas compan y into a billion energy giant with global reach trading electricity in all corners of the world and owning a multibilliondollar power project in India He has also led the push to deregulate the nations electricity markets Senior Bush administration officials said they welcomed Mr Lays input but did not always embrace it President Bush backed away from curbing carbondioxide emissions an effort supported by Enron which had looked to trade emission rights as part of its energy business Well make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy Mr Cheney said in an interview not what Enron thinks The BushLay bond traces back to Mr Bushs father and involves a personal and philosophical affinity Moreover Enron and its executives gave million to federal candidates in the last election more than any other energy company While some of that went to Democrats percent went to Republicans according to an analysis of election records by the Center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit group Hes for a lot of things were for said Mr Johnson But when it came to deciding on nominees for the commission Mr Johnson sa id that Mr Lays views were not that crucial The two most important advisers he said were Andrew Lundquist the director of Mr Cheneys energy task force and Pat Wood rd the head of the Texas public utility commission As governor Mr Bush named Mr Wood to the utility commission This year when the White House filled the two Republican slots on the federal agency Mr Wood was the first choice Mr Johnson said Consumer advocates and business executives praise Mr Wood But Mr Lay als o had a role in promoting him Shortly after Mr Bush was elected governor in Mr Lay sent him a letter endorsing Mr Wood as the best qualified person for the Texas commission In all there are five seats on the commission two held by Republicans tw o by Democrats and one held by a chairman who serves at the pleasure of the president Mr Hebert who became a commissioner in was named chairma n by Mr Bush in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions mandate to ensure fair prices in wholesale electricity and natural gas markets makes it crucial to sellers like Enron as well as consumers The movement toward deregulation sometimes leaves the commission caught in a tug of war power marketers like Enron are trying to break into markets and grids controlled by oldline utilities which operate under state regulatio n The commissions chairman has considerable latitude in setting its agenda As part of its oversight of the wholesale electricity markets the commissi on ordered several companies to refund what it considered excessively high prices this year in California One lesser offender named in the commission s public filings million of a total of million was an Enron subsidiary in Oregon Enron owns few generating assets but buys and sells electricity in the market Many of those transactions resemble the complicated riskshifting techniques used by Wall Street for financial instruments Mr Hebert after he became chairman initiated an examination into the effects those techniques have on the electricity markets One of our problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex arbitrage activities of a company like Enron he said adding were trying to do it now and we may have some results soon William L Massey one of the agencys two Democratic commissioners said h e supported the inquiry but had not been aware of it an indication of the chairmans ability to set the commissions agenda Finally the commission is trying to speed the pace of electricity deregulation by opening up the nations transmission grid much of which is owned by privately owned utilities that enjoy retail monopolies Some Enron officials say the commission has been moving too slowly to open the grid They attribute some of the problem to utilities But they also fault Mr Hebert Hebert still has undeserved confidence in some of the vertically integrat ed companies coming to the table and dealing openly with transmission access issues said Richard S Shapiro an Enron senior vice president The utilities however maintain that they provide cheap and reliable servi ce for their customers Washington lobbyists for one Southern utility said tha t Enron was really interested in focusing on the utilitys bigbusiness clients which under state regulation pay higher rates than residential customers Since about half the states have moved to open their retail markets t o competition and the commission has begun to make it easier for outsiders t o use the nations transmission grid But the promise of cheaper rates has be en largely unfulfilled So the push for more deregulation in which Enron has been a leader has slowed especially when Californias flawed program led to skyrocketing rates and chaotic markets Mr Hebert is a freemarket conservative who favors deregulation but also recognizes the importance of states rights A former Mississippi regulator he is a protege of Trent Lott the Senate Republican leader from Mississipp i Mr Hebert said Mr Lott was instrumental in his nomination to the commissi on in by President Clinton President Bush elevated Mr Hebert to chairman on Inauguration Day a move Mr Lay said he told the White House he supported Mr Johnson the White House personnel chief said that Mr Lott and Mr Hebert had both been told that Mr Hebert could remain chairman at least until the administrations nominees Mr Wood and Nora Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator are confirmed by the full Senate The Senate energy committee voted earlier this week to approve the two nominees after a hearing last week indicated strong support It is widely expected that President Bush will name Mr Wood to replace Mr Hebert as chairman after the Senate acts In an interview for a forthcoming episode of Frontline the PBS series Mr Cheney suggested as much Pat Woods got to be the new chairman of th e FERC and hell have to address various problems in the electricity markets he said Mr Hebert said that no one had told him he was being replaced If someone else is named chairman Mr Hebert can remain a commissioner until the end of his term which expires in It was a few weeks after President Bush made him chairman that Mr Hebert said he spoke by telephone with Mr Lay Mr Lay told him that he and Enron would like to support me as chairman but we would have to agree on principles involving the commissions role in expanding electricity competition Mr Hebert said of the conversation A senior commission official who was in Mr Heberts office during the conversation said Mr Hebert rebuffed Mr Lays offer of a quid pro quo Th e official said that he heard Mr Heberts side of the conversation and then after the call ended learned the rest from him Mr Hebert said that he too backed competition but did not think the commission had the legal authority to tell states what to do in this area Concerning the issue of opening transmission access through the creation of regional networks Mr Hebert supports a voluntary process while Enron seek s a faster and more compulsory system Mr Lay said that while he might have discussed issues relating to the commissions authority concerning access to the grid there was never any intent to link that or any other issue to Mr Heberts job status The commission is a quasijudicial agency so decisionmakers like Mr Heber t must avoid private discussions about specific matters pending before the commission Mr Hebert and Mr Lay both said that line was not crossed but Mr Hebert said he had never had such a blunt talk with an energyindustry executive Mr Lay added that his few recent conversations with Mr Hebert were nothin g special We had a lot of access during the Clinton administration he said And he said that while making political contributions probably helps to gain access to an official he made them because Im supporting candidate s I strongly believe in Last June Enron executives were asked to make voluntary donations to the companys political action committee The solicitation letter noted that th e company faced a range of governmental issues including electricity deregulation This year some people who sought but did not get nominations to the commission said that Mr Lay and Enron had had a role in the process One was Joe Garcia a former Florida utilities regulator and prominent CubanAmerican activist He said he had been interviewed by a few Enron officials including Mr Lay who he said had not been as forceful or insistent as the other Enron officials But in their conversation Mr Garcia said Mr Lay made clear that he woul d be visiting the White House adding that everyone knew of his relationshi p and his importance Mr Johnson the White House personnel chief could not cite another compan y besides Enron that sent him a list of preferred candidates for the commission but he remembered hearing the views of Tom Kuhn who heads the utility industry trade group the Edison Electric Institute Mr Kuhn was a classmate of Mr Johnson and Mr Bush at Yale As for his conversation with Mr Garcia Mr Lay said he was comfortable wi th his candidacy but Im not sure what I told him about my friends at the White House This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series Frontline which will broadcast a documentary about Californias energy crisis on June

Mirror Company SACRAMENTO In a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business a nd consumer disruptions Gov Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a threetier blackout warning system Forecasts of blackouts will be issued hours beforehand Davis said General areas will be identified in warnings issued hours before likely outages Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu t he said Business executives police and consumers have complained that the current warning systemin which blackouts can come with less than minutes warningdoes not give them sufficient time to save information on computer s shut down assembly lines safeguard traffic intersections and otherwise prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out In the past state grid operators only gave short notice because they often found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts They said they di d not want to repeatedly alarm people Utility officials have said they feare d that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to looters and burglars But crime has not been a problem during Californias six days of blackouts so far this year And with experts predicting dozens of days of forced outages this summer state and utility leaders say Californians are better off prepared If blackouts are going to occur Davis said there is no reason to keep the public in the dark We all deserve as much advance notice as possible Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio and television announcements Starting with June utility bills Southern California Edison customers will be given block numbers that allow them t o learn through the Edison Web site if they are schedule d for rotating blackouts on days of short supply Under the governors order Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said consumers can expect hour warnings about general areasSanta Monica or Santa Ana for examplethat might be targeted for hourlong blackouts At minutes before a blackout is triggered Bennett said the warnings delivered through radio television and the Internet will get much more precise For example he said One hour before well say Main Street in Santa Monica will be affected Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governors order by June And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear of blackout warnings they said the governors order will ultimately help the state avoid blackouts I think were going to save power potentially lives were going to help save jobs and Californias economy said Carl Guardino a member of the board that oversees the California Independent System Operator which manag es of the states transmission system Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca who said he inten ds to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today For some the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the state is failing to solve the energy crisis It obviously says were surrendering to the electricity crisis said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Here weve arrived in the st century with all the electronics and we dont have the power to run them Utility spokesmen lauded the plan but said that much of the responsibility rests with CalISO which is the only entity that has the ability to track supplies If the ISO only gives us minutes warning our customers will get something less than minutes notice said John Nelson spokesman for Pacific Gas Electric As it works now CalISO informs utilities of pending blackouts The utilit y in turn informs county offices of emergency services Using computerized calling email and manual dialing the utilities also inform law enforcement major industrial users people on life support and other consumers for whom electricity is vital Nelson said Californians at large are expected to learn of the warnings through the med ia and the CalISO Web site Also on Thursday Davis met with officials of Californias publicly owned utility districts and came away he said with promises that they would sel l excess power to the state at prices significantly lower than on the spot market Legislature hangs Davis out to dry By Nick Driver Of The Examiner Staff Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov Gray Davis plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with one of their own The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San Diegoarea utility and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase PGE lines through bankruptcy proceedings And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his own transmission line deal A week ago Davis finally found a termlimited senator Richard Polanco DLos Angeles to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso n lines Now the governors office admits that talks will not proceed until the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edisons lines Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi s plan giving the state a fiveyear option to purchase all power lines for billion While a much lower price the bill would also lower Edisons debt by forcing power marketers to accept percent of the billion ow ed them Under the terms of that proposal the state would still have to loan Edison money around billion and would guarantee SoCal Edisons sale of a further billion in bonds The state would also receive a conservation easement on acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land As in the Davis bill SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively lowcost electricity for years from one of its power plants and force parent company Edison International to repay million in transfers A Republican plan labeled Plan R now making its way through the halls of the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister except it allows the state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build The Democratic bills sponsors Assemblymen John Dutra DFremont Joe Nation DSan Rafael and Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg believe they can persuade Edisons board of directors to approve their deal even though it is not as attractive as the governors offer Edison refused to comment on the plan Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge were trying a different strategy Wednesday The minority partys Plan R has not been introduced as official legislation but instead floated among Republicans a nd Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edisons only real alternative to bankruptcy and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern neighbor PGE in bankruptcy So far Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators charging high wholesale prices PGE declared bankruptcy April A governors office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all attention away from any dealmaking but that the two sides continued to me et frequently Another adviser Joe Fichera said there are lots of moving parts to the deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electrics transmission lines bu t that he continued to meet with company representatives including an allda y meeting Monday In San Diego a spokesman for SDGE referred all calls to t he governors office But the sponsor of the Davis bill Polanco is not one of the legislatures power brokers and most lawmakers said the billion memorandum of understanding is now in serious jeopardy A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos including the threat of an increase in blackouts The governor and business leaders have said the economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages rises Legislators policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne ed and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the state especially if the bulk of them now owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co are still not for sale Critics such as Senate President John Burton DSan Francisco one of the bills strongest proponents three months ago now say the state should not be in the business of replacing or upgrading dilapidated lines at a cost of upwards of billion Others see the state as the best candidate for improving a system long neglected by utilities State ownership of the transmission grid would be a better way to help gri d problems such as connecting wind generators said Joe Ito an energy analy st at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories It has been extremely difficult to buil d new transmission capacity over the last years especially into bottlenec ks like San Francisco Bush unveiled his Energy Plan last week including a key plank that would allow the federal government to use eminent domain to purchase private land and build more transmission lines Bush arrives Tuesday for talks with Davi s on this and other solutions to the energy crisis The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights derides both presidential a nd legislative attempts to create more consumerfriendly deals labeling them Bailout Lite The sponsors want to try and trim away some of the fat said Doug Heller a spokesman for the group But its all fat

Californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday The backup generators will help us get through the summer said S David Freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis drive for energy conservation Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan The governor will announce what hes going to do he said Wednesday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with The Bee Roger Salazar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm whe n or whether Davis would make such an announcement I dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that Salazar said Under the plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators an d simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted The state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation Deploying dieselpowered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggl e to get more megawatts flowing through California Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power tha t will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts A megawatt is enough power for to households The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis administrations policy The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that routine use of the backup diesel s would endanger public health San Diego Gas Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today b y the Davisappointed state Public Utilities Commission Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis A letter signed Wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the American Lung Association of California urged Davis to reconsider Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states Freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemergen cy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages This is a nobrainer Freeman said Youve got human lives at stake here This is a scary situation Freeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go aw ry in blackouts But Sandra Spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League countered If the health impacts are so marginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed this Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locomotives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power Unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most generators in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming nitrogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant according to air board engineers Further the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say Davis plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a Stage alert meaning the power supplies are running l ow and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsing according to Freeman Salazar the governors spokesman said only Any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have th e state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity Freem an would not confirm the pay rate The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules For operators of existing power plants the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om BushDavis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau Published May WASHINGTON President Bush will meet next week with Gov Gray Davis to ta lk about Californias worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coas t wholesale electricity prices Details for the BushDavis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday b ut the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issue California is a very big state said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer It represents onesixth of the United States Its the sixthlargest econo my in the world And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Govern or Davis Its important Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said electricity price caps will be at th e top of the governors agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday But Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno Until now the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas fro m the Democratic congressional delegation Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers an d a handful of Republicans but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort state In recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on Capitol Hill Bushs two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whose names were forwarded to the Senate floo r Wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls once they a re seated on the panel And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate moving Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico a pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the k ey Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee California Sen Dianne Feinstein a committee Democrat said Wednesday that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of pricecontrol legislation On Wednesday Rep Doug Ose RSacramento announced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price reli ef for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer Ose chairman of the House Government Reform Committees energy subcommitte e said his bill would extend throughout the West a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the FERC But instead of that plan taking effect onl y during power emergencies as the commission directed it would operate aroun d the clock under Oses bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of the leastefficient plant selling into the California market Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through longterm contracts rather than on the volatile spot market I am looking for a middle ground Ose said The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Energy Digest GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published May State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to Gov Gray Davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesdays split was necessary because there are few differences between the governors plan and the Democrats plan The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow Edison to pay off billion in debts In return ratepayers would receiv e either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase electricity at discount rates Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Utility companies and outofstate power generators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californias energy crisis but Gov Gray Davis grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months according to a Field Poll released Wednesday And Californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states powe r woes except themselves Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve ry good job to improve the energy situation Only percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job Public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since January when percent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high marks The public sees themselves as conserving energy said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo Thats the only positive movement in the survey For Davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from positive In the January poll the Democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor ratings from only percent But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May and Sunday opinions about Davis flipflopped After months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think Davis is doing a good job while percent gave him failing grades The po ll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin g over well any more DiCamillo said The public is starting to view this a s a longterm problem not some temporary policy shift Still Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis Preside nt Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry The publics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in January dro ps even lower in the May poll Utility companies received bad ratings from hal f the public in January but percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job Outofstate energy generators whom Davis has accused of gouging ratepayers fell from percent low ratings in January to perce nt in the May poll Bush the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utiliti es Commission are not far behind drawing poor grades from more than half the public Cheney the architect of Bushs energy proposal received low ratin gs from percent The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called Cheney grossly misinformed on the states energy problems Cheney in turn has called Davis energy proposals harebrained and goofy The state Legislature receives poor marks from percent of those polled while only percent believe it is doing a good job The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or New views emerging on power More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The Bees John Hill can be reached at or Californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol l Related graphic By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove

Rep Anna Eschoo DPalo Alto said Tuesday that if the Bush administration tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than million acres off the California coast it would be like targeting a missile at us So far the Bush administration hasnt taken any direct action The energy policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development but it s only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of interior and commerce reexamine current laws and executive orders to determine if changes are needed Todays report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas

states energy crisis By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisi s at arms length President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a twoday visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov Gray Davis White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the states energy crisis will be at the top of the list when the president a nd the governor meet The presidents aides said that the time and place for t he meeting are still being worked out Bushs visit to the state will be his first since last falls campaign Wit h their party enjoying only a slim majority in the US House some Californi a Republicans have expressed dismay over their states absence from the presidents extensive postinaugural travel schedule fearing that the ener gy crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next years elections Fleischers announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to California However Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicke r action on the energy front Californians cant afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution We need relief today In the longer of two letters Davis wrote You and I dont agree on everything But heres something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up Davis also offered in the letters to introduce Bush to business owners a nd everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with business leaders and energy consumers Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis Fleischer suggested the presidents schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis suggestions This is a case of they both want to meet with each other and were very pleased to be able to make it work out he said As for the meeting with the business leaders Fleischer said The presiden t has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders an d energy consumers and so it very well may happen that were each suggesting similar things which would be a healthy sign Bushs itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Mari ne Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut the ir energy use by percent at California facilities Fleischer said that the president wanted to talk about how the federal government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in th e cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at risk The White House released an outline of the presidents California itinerary on Tuesday afternoon It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to the states energy woes Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while in California Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the electricity shortages toll on the state and its citizens They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before t he House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the state The administration and most of the states Republican lawmakers oppo se the measure Last week Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation s energy challenges that stressed longrange solutions focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear powe r The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and greater fuel efficiency Bushs trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night He will return to Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area Bush assumed office despite losing the nations most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule o f any modern president It included stops in states not California Lewis reported from Washington and Sweeney from Sacramento California Democrats seek price caps on electricity By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON Accusing power generators of price gouging a group of California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislat e price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state Rep Henry Waxman a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the pricecap measure said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday At th at time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bi ll designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summ er due to shortages in the supply of electrical power Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fundraising events on Mond ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws Waxman said It is a contrived crisis in order to produce percent increases in profits for some of these generators On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep Joe Barton RTexas that would allow California Gov Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent It also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities Earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxmans pricecap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve Californias crisis The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production Waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit At the press conference Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego derided Republican opposition to price caps Referring to wholesale power generators Filner argued They were making money at a megawatt now they are charging up to Believe me Th ey can make money off the market with a costbase rate They have done it for years They can continue doing it Rep Jane Harman DRedondo Beach said that California Republicans on the energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from party leaders to oppose the pricecap bill There are no party affiliations for rate payers said Harman a committee member Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rate s in California Mexico No limit on number of new plants to be built Energy chief says anyone who requests a permit will get it By Diane Lindquist UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico wont s et any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the border Since theres a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ ia for electricity anyone who requests a permit will get it Martens said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas th annual Latin American Energy Conference in La Jolla Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most immediate solutions to Californias electricity shortfalls At least three plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blackouts have interrupted normal activity One facility a Sempra Energy Corp power plant near Mexicali will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border The San Dieg o companys project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th e facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican market Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety In his speech Martens emphasized Mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities But afterward he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve California consumers I dont see any limit The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin g lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he said With a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja California will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California plants let alone any additional facilities Sempra whose San Diego Gas Electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday The improvement will transmit electricity from Sempras plant in Baja California to the company substatio n in Imperial Valley The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana Clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building Baja California plants plan to transmit their electricity Representatives of the firms cou ld not be reached yesterday Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border the California grid system presents another obstacle To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo r transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic e Its become very important because of our proximity to Mexico said district spokesman Ron Hull The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja California Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities Sempra again is a key player in this area It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego The pipeline wont provide fuel for any other facilities Its fully subscribed said Clark In the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased Energy Secretary Martens however hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in Baja California He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation Martens comments were the first to indicate that two and not one might b e approved for Baja California Potential governor candidate launches Northern

cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Over the past four months Californians have developed increasingly negativ e feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in Californias energy crisis according to a Field Poll released Thursday A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas Electrics bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provide service to its customers Fiftyseven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute a Sa n Franciscobased nonpartisan polling organization gave Californias private electric utilities a poor rating Thats more than the percent of respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January The same negative feelings held true for outofstate energy providers Fiftyfive percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poo r a noticeable increase from the percent of respondents who gave them a po or rating in January Specifically those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state The poll found that The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Commission a poor rating rose from percent in January to percent in May percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May as opposed percent in January percent gave Gov Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the states energy woes a sharp increase from percent who gave him a po or rating in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from respondents In May percent said FERC was doing a poor job as opposed to percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January Those surveyed were also asked if PGEs bankruptcy would make it more difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers and percen t said they thought it would The poll which questioned California adults between May

electricity And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alternatives to power sources Thats the only thing we can do in the short term In the long term you can almost see what will be coming down the pike As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kicked out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected during the termlimit era A statewide initiative brave candidates ending term limits those are a ll things that will happen in the future Right now its time to tune in turn off and drop out Tune in to

easier than it appears Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by switching off some lights converting to fluorescent light bulbs turning down the refrigerator and

worked out said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity But any plan would have to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts Davis also hopes to give hour and then hour notices of probable blackout scenarios Administration officials said the twoday notice would go to law enforcement while everyone would get a hour warning Business groups welcomed the

about employee safety issues The more notice we have the better we can accommodate the blackout Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and working with the governor Sixty minutes is twice as good as minutes he said With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses As much notice as possible would be helpful Its helpful to have some advance notice for planning purposes but small businesses will still be hu rt by the blackouts said Shirley Knight assistant state director of the National Federation of Independent Business Most small businesses are in the service sector so theyre open during the day which means smallbusiness owners arent going to be able to recoup those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to Knight said But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more

last resort t o avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we are in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators That would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garve y executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its on e thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electr ic grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the states power crunch began regional airquality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen a buildi ng block of asthmainducing smog Small generators fight for payment from utilities Posted at pm PDT Wednesday May BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News BAKERSFIELD A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge Th e clamor of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone Employees have painted Oildales machinery insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless ton turbine Now they wait Its kind of like a skeleton says plant manager Mike Pankratz surveyi ng the octopustangle of pipes and tanks Choked by the million Pacific Gas Electric Co owes it Oildale shut down Feb taking its megawatts of badly needed electricity with it T he hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most seriou s issues of Californias energy crisis one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plants battling Californias utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them These small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of Californias electricity At least have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills Four ha ve sued PGE And PGEs bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least small generators including Oildale In many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with th e utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market What this is basically is the revolt of the mice said Bill Short wit h Ridgewood Power Management a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in California and sued PGE Officials to weigh debt The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities Commission which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilitie s to pay the back debt Meanwhile US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from PGE The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately small generator s threatens Californias fragile power supply just as the state heads into th e summer months up to megawatts short The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of Californias energy crunc h add up daily In Oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of more than employees at the refinery next door Its one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue California is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in it s own back yard they say Gasfired cogeneration plants which provide powe r to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities are some of the mos t efficient producers in the state And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced natural gas The idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else this is jus t nuts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state This is really a major blunder The immediate crisis started in late January Oildales Pankratz explained Thats when PGE told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in December The news worried Oildales gas supplier Pankratz said which halted the plants supply Pankratz turned off the plants turbine The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties the refinery that looms over Oildale Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces Golden Bear filed for bankruptcy April Last week it announced plans to lay off employees Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale Golden Bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago Having it go under was gutwrenching he said Power unavailable The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrici ty grid reports that megawatts of power from small generators are off line It estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both Others say financial problems have megawatts off line Lawmakers havent been much help The state Assembly on March rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies The iss ue has languished in Sacramento Days later the utilities commission ordered Californias utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty backdue amount s It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity That price is percent lower and too low for business some argue The commissions position has been that the small generators should abide b y their existing contracts said commission attorney Gary Cohen To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critic s Its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying How long can you hold up until the ship comes said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts c an resolve the issue Were in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship said Shor t with Ridgewood the independent generator that has sued PGE Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their contracts Five have lost their fights Another five have won the right to put a lien on Edisons assets In PGEs battle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy In the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy As for Oildale it wants PGE to pay the million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market It also wants PGE to pay what it calls a fair market value for its electricity If Oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forced into bankruptcy its attorneys argue Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months PGE is fighting to keep its small generators which it says are exaggerati ng their damage It reports that only a tiny fraction of its generators ar e off line Increased costs If the plants were released from their contracts PGE could not afford to pay the extra million per month it estimates electricity would cost T he state Department of Water Resources and ultimately ratepayers would have to foot that bill A fast solution isnt likely from the bankruptcy court The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions Meanwhile the clock ticks Weve all been a little tense says Judy Andreatta who has worked Oildales front desk for years and worries about her job Its just so scary watching everything happen Whod ever think wed lose power Electricity notebook FERC may renew price caps May From Register wire services Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year The price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation This proposed action said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif could make a real difference Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap the price of natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than t he rest of the nation said Feinstein Currently she said the price in Southern California is per million British Thermal Units and only in the rest of the Western region Gas fuels most electricitygenerating plants in the state The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to California or include other Western markets Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison Davis tack is politically volatile The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy May By HANH KIM QUACH and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov Gray Davis made to rescue the states No utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable Davis deal some have complained is sweeter for Southern California Ediso n than for taxpayers So at least four proposals are being floated to supplan t that plan But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them Plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddli ng could result in what neither side wants bankruptcy for Edison Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison a nd Pacific Gas Electric which is already in bankruptcy complete the Chapter process which could take years experts and lawmakers said The states wallet would shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said Bria n Bennett vice president of Edison International the utilitys parent company Southern California Edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan which calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission gri d for billion Company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it Bennett said Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal Edison is going to survive said Mitch Wilk a member of the state Publi c Utilities Commission from through and a past president of the agency But the question is whether it will survive via the plan that th e governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PGE did There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly Wilk said PGE chose to file Chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with t he progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company PGE s move was an embarrassment for Davis who had vowed to keep the states big utilities solvent One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said Ed Feo a lawyer involved with the PGE case It would be a black eye for the state As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade Edisons creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of June Dean Vanech president of New Jerseybased Carson Cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edis on into bankruptcy In general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made Vanech said But he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timeMeanwhile Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal The company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said John Bryson chief executive of Edison International Bankruptcy is a last resort Bryson said in a recent interview We believe there will be a solution But changes are necessary said Senate Leader John Burton DSan Francisco because people didnt like Plan A Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan which many thought was over ly generous to Edison limiting investigation of the utilitys parents compan y and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment Alternatives include requiring power generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billion theyre owed taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing Edison to bui ld more power plants The latest proposal would require the state to sell bond s to pay off Edisons debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later Most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts One hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house behind one plan necessary any time the state spends money Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders Sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court Bankruptcies are messy but so is the political process Sweeney said Were in a situation where the leadership politically seems not willing to bite the bullet It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office Long Beach obtains lien on Edisons assets The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ Poll in state favor nuclear power Its a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident May The Associated Press Fiftynine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants according to a poll released Wednesday The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy was five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvan ia and it found percent opposed to nuclear power In my interpretation the current energy crisis has some bearing on the publics changed attitudes on nuclear power said Mark DiCamillo spokesma n for the nonpartisan polling organization The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look a t nuclear power No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in th e United States since The poll of California adults was taken May The margin of erro r was plus or minus percent Carl Zichella the Sierra Clubs regional staff director said Californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about years and do not have as much information as they did around Three Mile Island I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground he said The more people know about nuclear power the less theyre going to like it Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems financing and siting said Rich Ferguson research director for the Sacramento based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest th e billions of dollars he said Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review PLEASANTON Calif May PRNewswire San Josebased Calpine Corporation NYSE CPN and San Franciscobased Bechtel Enterprises Holdin gs Inc today filed an Application For Certification AFC with the California Energy Commission CEC for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in Hayward Calif The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in California The filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at Enterprise Avenue in Hayward The site is adjacent to the city of Haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center Th e Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the Bay Area The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said Curt Hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the CalpineBechtel Joint Development We look forward to working with the City of Hayward Alameda County and the California Energy Commission to develop a model Energy Center Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of extensive engineering technical and environmental studies We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process Hildebrand added We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we can to help solve the states energy crisis as quickly as possible Once the CEC determines that the application is complete and determine whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process the officia l review will begin As lead agency the CEC will work with environmental an d government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and hearings to encourage community participation The expedited review process would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer review period Based upon the successful licensing of the project construction could begin in summer of with commercial operation by summer of Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and

May Xinhua via COMTEX Governor of California Gra y Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving construction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage California is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove California The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas storage project in Lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling The crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers And the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax money so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them Among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has called for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayResidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer From the Oakland Tribune Lockyer Probe may spark suit Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his investigation of alleged multibilliondollar price gouging by power generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could w in huge refunds But the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power company officials being locked up with my tattooed dude Lockyer a former East Bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal I would love to personally escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Houstonbased Enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the California market It dismissed Lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration Other power companies have expressed outrage I was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators Lockyer said I decided to make the point with the energy generators that theyve got a serious fight on their hands The attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever since because Im a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about thes e sorts of accusations or claims But I know it wont be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said We dont care if theyre multimillionaires We dont care if they run big corporations Theyre buccaneers Theyre ripping us off Now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or illegal greed its clearly immoral Theres no debate about that Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the streng th of the states case I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said A civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said The California Independent System Operator which manages the states electric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by billion since early last year The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agencys ongoing probe Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe Theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation Lockyer said The attorney generals comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by California officials against power suppliers as well as ongoing probes Besides the attorney and FERC the Legislature state Public Utilities Commission CalISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all conducting investigations by MediaNews Group Inc and ANG Newspapers

elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The Bees John Hill can be reached at or Californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol l By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a percent to percent margin Californians desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch respondents said By a margin of percent to percent poll respondents say they would maintain airquality standards rather than relax them to build plants That support is down from a Field survey in January when percent said theyd rather maintain standards Moreover a majority percent say they would relax airquality standards to get older plants back in operation an increase from percent in January Slight majorities support a staterun public power authority percent a nd stateowned power transmission lines percent but DiCamillo said that some poll respondents were probably not familiar

May Desperately seeking megawatts San Diego Gas Electric Co wants to pay local industries to fire up their highpolluting emergency diesel generator s this summer to relieve the electricity grid and avoid rolling blackouts If approved by the state Public Utilities Commission the proposal could increase the regions generating capacity by up to megawatts enough to serve about homes and significantly minimize if not eliminate planne d blackouts Customer willingness to participate has been quite strong if the proper incentives are in place said Debra Reed president of SDGE which serves million consumers in San Diego and southern Orange counties The utility estimates the program would cost million Environmental opposition to date has come mainly from the states chief airpollution enforcer the California Air Resources Board which can influence but has no direct control over air pollution rules set by San Diegoarea elected officials The board contends that the San Diego region which already suffers some of the worst smog in the nation would see its air quality deteriorate further if the notoriously dirty diesel generators are deployed en masse Most diesel generators have few or no pollution controls and megawatt for megawatt spew about times more smogforming emissions of nitrogen oxid es than do new power plants fired by natural gas said Michael Kenny air boar d executive officer The standby diesels also pump out significantly more particles of soot that can lodge deep in the lung and cause cancer The SDGE proposal would expend ratepayer dollars on extremely polluting a nd expensive power decrease participation in more sound conservation programs and not make a significant difference in the number or extent of blackouts Kenny said in a letter of opposition The utilities commission is scheduled to vote on the proposed rolling blackout reduction program Thursday in San Francisco Many utilities have offered similar financial incentives to get businesses off the power grid at times of peak demand The San Diego utilitys plan however would take powershedding where it has not gone before by explicit ly rewarding the use of higherpolluting power sources We have not gone down that path said Kevin Payne Southern California Edisons director of technical support for customers Edison is proposing cleaner alternatives than diesels to get powerintensive businesses off the grid when supplies are tight Officials at Pacific Gas Electric said they too have stopped short of enlisting the use of diesel generators We definitely see merit in being able to avert blackouts and the diesel generator being the tool to do that but we have concerns about the environmental impacts said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Under the San Diego utilitys plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators at the utilitys request and simultaneous disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted Utility officials say the diesels would run in strict compliance with all rules of local state and federal air pollution enforcement agencies But unlike most local air pollution control districts San Diego Countys allow s unlimited use of emergency generators when rolling blackouts appear imminen t Richard Smith assistant director of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District said his board of elected officials believes the deployme nt of backup diesels would not only spare businesses millions of dollars in lo st revenue but would also shield San Diego residents from greater pollution th at would come when even more standby generators kick in during a blackout PGE officials say it would be unfair for one area of the state to avoid power outages by cranking up dirty diesels when other areas of the state go dark spokeswoman Homrig said If there are going to be blackouts it should be blackouts for everybody she said The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om Lawsuit wants to cap cost of power By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau Published May Key lawmakers touted their lawsuit filed Tuesday against federal energy regulators as a lastditch maneuver to relieve California from summer blackouts and high electricity costs Filed on behalf of the Legislature and the city of Oakland the suit charge s that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to fulfill its leg al duties by allowing generators to charge unreasonable rates for power in California The lawsuit filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg seeks immediate caps on wholesale energy rates an d refunds from past purchases The two Democrats noted that power prices shot up from a megawatt in to as high as earlier this year Burton suggested a cap is reasonable The people of California need some relief some protection from these outrageous prices Hertzberg said In our judgment the law is clear i t is clear that the federal regulators are ignoring the law Under the Federal Power Act FERC is charged with setting just and reasonable wholesale energy prices The commission adopted a plan in late April that would cap rates once reserves fall below percent in what is called a Stage power emergenc y But California officials denounced that plan as ineffective noting that th e state needs relief before emergencies strike High energy costs have helped drain more than billion from the states general fund since California began purchasing electricity for utilities in January In addition the state faces at least hours of power blackouts this summer according to the North American Electric Reliability Council Those outages are a health threat to Californias most vulnerable residents Burt on said But Jan SmutnyJones who represents wholesale generators as executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association said a suit would solve none of Californias problems We need to tone down the political rhetoric and fix problems rather than t ry to litigate this he said This lawsuit will not add one megawatt of generation to the system nor will it decrease demand in California Gov Gray Davis who has attacked the Bush administration for not capping energy prices said he supports the lawsuit I support all efforts to recoup the windfall profits that these generators have recovered by gouging our utilities at the cost of having to be passed off in some form or fashion to the customers over time the Democratic governor said The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or All spin no juice Energy debate shifts from policy to politics Published May If the spin machines of the Davis and Bush administrations generated electricity California wouldnt have to worry about blackouts Unfortunately political hot air wont drive a turbine Both Gov Gray Davis and Vice President Dick Cheney have stepped up their fingerpointing campaigns with the governor blaming Bush for abandoning California and Cheney blaming Davis for ignoring the problem until it blew into a crisis But while the governor and the White House play blame games some of the re al policy work sits uncompleted As temperatures soar and June approaches the re is nothing close to a consensus on the three unresolved challenges of the power crisis returning the states investorowned utilities to solvency preventing independent generators from exploiting a broken wholesale power market and keeping alternative generators producing power at reasonable rates For the somewhat distant future some policy pieces have fallen into place The need for more power will be met by plants under construction and in the approval process The states million investment in new conservation a nd efficiency initiatives will dampen demand for power The creation of a stat e public power authority gives California a tool to deal with imbalances in t he electricity marketplace But the immediate crisis offers only unpleasant and controversial choices all of them heavily freighted with political risk Decisions about rescuing the utilities or controlling wholesale prices hinge on different ideologica l views of the proper role of government in the marketplace and the causes of the electricity mess And the stakes are extraordinary both for California s economy and for political positioning in the national battle over energy policy and future elections In the absence of quick policy action though all of the fingerpointers stand to lose Cheney is right about Davis dilatory approach to the power crisis but dead wrong in shirking federal responsibility for what comes next The federal government alone has authority to restrict the wholesale price of power to what is just and reasonable This is the law and the Bus h administration refuses to enforce it As long as the sky is the potential limit on wholesale electricity prices both for purchases past and present its harder for the political system t o resolve the past debts of the utilities and the contractual relationships with alternative generators If the Bush administration wants to turn the political heat on Davis and Sacramento it must do its own job first The only thing preventing that is a near fanatical belief that with electricity the free market can do no wrong Majority supports energy price caps new nuclear plants By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May Californians are sharply divided over a host of proposals to address the energy crisis with a new statewide poll showing caps on wholesale electricity prices the most popular fix and a billion bond to buy pow er for the state the most unpopular The nonpartisan Field Poll shows the Bush administrations refusal to consider energy price controls at odds with Californians who support caps overwhelmingly percent to percent Though that might give Gov Gray Davis ammunition to escalate his criticism of White House passivity in the crisis the most aggressive action the governor has taken to date registers strong disapproval Coalitions generator plan rejected Davis trims outlook for new power Water district may seek additional bids to build power plant Proposed plant caught in citystate tug of war Fiftytwo percent of the California adults surveyed said they oppose the record billion bond issue authorized by Davis and the Legislature to purchase power over the next two years Only percent thought the bond issue was a good idea and percent had no opinion Concerning other proposals percent to percent support creating a staterun power authority to operate power plants and percent to percent favor the state buying transmission lines from utilities A narrow plurality percent to percent opposes the idea of Davis invoking the governors emergency powers to seize power plants The telephone survey was conducted from May to Sunday According to statistical theory such a poll is accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points While the Field Poll shows the energy problems have not shaken Californians longheld opposition to permitting offshore oil drilling and relaxing clea n air standards it revealed a stunning reversal on nuclear power Nearly three in five in the survey percent said they favor building mo re nuclear power plants percent was opposed That represents a turnabout from when percent supported nuclear power plants and percent opposed them The resurgence of public support for nuclear power is something I never would have predicted before we did the survey said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll But its been some years since ThreeMile Island the Pennsylvania nuclear plant accident and it seems th at the safety record is there Reaction to many of the electricity proposals broke heavily along partisan lines and reflected the two major parties attitudes toward government While Democrats favored creating a public power authority purchasing transmission lines and seizing power plants Republicans were strongly opposed to these ideas But asked about rate caps members of both parties were heavily in favor Republicans favored rate caps percent to percent With Democrats though the gap was twice as wide percent to percent This is one area where the federal government and the Bush administration is exposed to longterm damage here in California said DiCamillo At the same time the pollster said Davis has not made the case for such a large bond issue to alleviate a crisis the majority of Califorians believe has been artificially exacerbated to drive up the profits of energy companies Its a huge bond issue and I think the sheer size of it is dragging it dow n some DiCamillo said I think the cynicism that the public has about the causes of this and why this whole crisis has come to be really prevents the public from supporting this kind of

EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Californias Democratic legislative leaders asked a federal appeals panel Tuesday to order federal regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices The people of California need some protection from these outrageous prices said Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg The move by Hertzberg of Van Nuys and Senate President John Burton of San Francisco came after unsuccessful lobbying by Gov Gray Davis and other lawmakers to get the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose strict price caps The citizens of California are suffering immediate irreparable harm as a result of FERCs abrogation of its duty to establish just and reasonable rates for electricity the lawmakers wrote to the th US Circuit Court o f Appeals which has jurisdiction over FERC The lawmakers joined by the city of Oakland said Californias looming threat of continued blackouts are an imminent threat to the health welfar e and safety of every California citizen Theres a danger this entire economy can come unwound warned former governor and now Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown He plans to recruit his fellow mayors to also pressure FERC However Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks questioned whethe r the federal court will intervene in the commissions ongoing regulatory decisions If the court takes it its meritorious If not its political Cox said The suit comes after more than a year of wholesale power prices reaching historically high levels In December prices in California reached pe r megawatt hour and they have skyrocketed to as much as per megawat t hour during peak times since then The Bush administration ardently opposes price caps and President Bush has declined Davis request to urge FERC to impose strict caps Vice President Dick Cheney chief architect of the administrations energy plan released last week said capping prices would not increase energy supplies or reduce demand We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy instead of dealing with the real issues Chene y said Sunday Cheney criticized Davis a Democrat for what he called a harebrained scheme to use the states budget surplus to buy power because Californias two largest utilities face enormous financial problems For the short term the Bush administration has approved Davis request to expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal facilities in California to reduce energy consumption percent this summer Sacramento and the White House appear locked in a highvoltage war of rhetoric over energy policies There is broad bipartisan dissatisfaction in Sacramento with Washingtons response to Californias energy crisis the result of its own deregulation rules Last month FERC did order a oneyear cap on electricity sold into Californi a during power emergencies when power reserves fall below percent The agency did not set a price and also required the state to join a regional transmission organization which could limit Californias ability to contro l its own power grid Davis called the plan a Trojan horse and state power regulators dismisse d the cap as inadequate saying it would profit power generators at ratepayer s expense In addition Davis and state lawmakers sharply criticized FERC for considering requiring the states power grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the

Poll The publics fear of nuclear power is being mitigated by the longterm experience with nuclear power in other states and it is letting down its fears At the same time the poll shows a majority of Californians want air pollution controls to remain in place and reject offshore oil drilling and greater use of coalfired power plants to provide more energy Significantly although once the subject of passionate no nukes protests and controversial initiatives in California nuclear power now has a majori ty of support among Democrats Republicans and independent voters alike the poll showed While Californians gave thumbs up to a power source being pushed by the Bus h administration for the long term they also backed federal price ceilings o n energy a shortterm measure rejected repeatedly by

last winter Despite the opposition from Bush and Republican leaders percent of registered Republican voters in California support price limits as do an overwhelming percent of Democrats DiCamillo says the findings clearly dramatize that the consequences of not having federal price caps will be quite severe for the Bush administration as we go into the summer and have blackouts California voters see the price limit proposal as the one way out fo r the state to continue to buy power he said The one proposal the publi c really wants is something that the state itself cannot do It require s the assistance of the federal government The poll underscoring the shifting political landscape created by Californias deepening energy woes came even as Vice President Dick Cheney was making another highprofile plea for more nuclear energy We want to assess the potential for nuclear energy to make a major contribution in terms of improving air quality said Cheney speaking in Washington DC before the Nuclear Energy Institute He called nuclear power a very important part of our energy policy today in the United States The Field Poll findings on nuclear energy were met with enthusiasm by the nuclear industry and harsh criticism from environmentalists Its not surprising said Mitch Singer spokesman for the group that Chen ey addressed yesterday People are seeing an industry running efficiently running safely pumping out a lot of electricity and with no emissions into the atmosphere Whats happening here is the growing consensus and recognition that nuclear energy needs to be part

contractors would build and maintain the equipment which would be installed on commercial and residential buildings Ammiano hopes to ask voters in November to approve a Charter amendment that would allow the Board of Supervisors to issue revenue bonds to pay for the project The bond debt would be paid back with money made from the sale of the electricity and lease payments from participating

Higher power costs zapped restaurateur Marino Sandova l and his customers even before California regulators decided how to allocate a billion electricity rate hike the highest in state history Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill Sandova l last month raised prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain El Balazo by as much as percent on some items A giant burrito that cost at the end of March costs today We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything from our beans to our tortillas was going up almost every day Our higher prices ha ve everything to do with the higher energy prices said Sandoval who runs s ix restaurants in the San Francisco area From hotels to bagel shops businesses throughout California have been raising prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power costs Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs which utilities have been passing along to customers Now businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the states two bigges t utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The higher rates which will begin appearing in Junes utility bills threaten to jolt the states alreadyjittery economy Pretty soon we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession said Dave Puglia a vice president for APCO a public affairs firm hired by California business interests to study the economic effect of the states energy woes By itself the billion rate increase approved in late March by the California Public Utilities Commission probably isnt enough to topple the states roughly trillion economy the sixth largest in the world After weeks of public hearings and intensive lobbying by various customer groups the commission voted last week how to spread the pain of those rate hikes It will cause some hardships particularly for some small business owners but from the macro point of view these rate increases arent going to have a major impact on Californias output predicted Sung Won Sohn chief economist for Wells Fargo Co which runs the biggest bank headquartered in the state But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline natural gas health care benefits and workers compensation insurance Against this backdrop many employers also face pressure to raise their workers wages to help pay for Californias high housing costs If this keeps up at some point we are going to reach a breaking point i n the economy said Allan Zaremberg president of the California Chamber of Commerce The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and Economic Stability a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricit y rate increase from businesses to households Under the plan approved by the PUC businesses are expected to pay about billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional billion Even if they are spared on their utility bills consumers still will be pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along their electricity price increases The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about percent to percent of a big manufacturers budget Puglia estimated up from about percent now I wouldnt be surprised if we see some companies go out of business becau se of this said Justin Bradley director of energy programs for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Association a hightech trade group Even if they dont shut down completely many companies likely will lay off workers as they cut costs to pay for power The California Manufacturers an d Technology Association estimates the energy crisis will result in the loss of jobs or about more than the entire dotcom industry has laid off nationwide during the past months Painful though they may be most economists say higher electricity rates an d some resulting layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number o f blackouts that probably would have occurred if retail prices hadnt been raised Even though the monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from last year to this year Sandoval said customers continue to pour into his El Balazo restaurants despite higher menu prices Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am going to have to raise my prices again he said If I have to I will I dont think people are going to stop eating because of this Blackouts may

rolling blackouts are likely under a plan proposed Monday by the states power grid operator More information also would be available about the days electricity supply and demand as well as a forecast on the likelihood of nextday rolling blackouts The proposals are an effort by the Independent System Operator which operates the power grid to respond to criticism that the six blackouts tha t have occurred so far in California have caused costly disruptions of communities and businesses Problems have ranged from car accidents when traffic signals went blank to lost production caused by computerized equipment suddenly going down The additional lead time would help people prepare for the outages For now however Southern California Edison customers wouldnt be told where the first outages would hit The utility would publicize the locations of subsequent outages Ernie Rodriguez owner of Southern California Plastics in Santa Ana said anything would be helpful Our equipment is very sensitive said Rodriguez whose company custom molds plastic We need to prepare our machines and even minutes would be helpful But the ISOs proposal wasnt enough for some members of the Legislature wh o have advocated prescheduled blackouts Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would require the state Public Utilities Commission to notify businesses an d homeowners of possible blackouts as much as one month ahead of time We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly The ISOs board of governors will consider the early warning system at its meeting Thursday If adopted it could go into effect May and provide ne w more timely information on several fronts When demand is high the ISO would issue forecasts to the news media emergency services and utilities of peak demand supply and weather for the next hours A power watch would be issued when the ISO calls a Stage alert in whic h reserves dip below percent or a Stage alert when the system is within percent of running out of power The ISO would issue a power warning if theres a chance that a Stag e alert in which reserves fall below percent will be called Thirty minutes before a blackout occurs the ISO would issue a notice of probable load interruption If additional supply is found or demand is reduced no blackout would be necessary Steven Conroy a spokesman for Southern California Edison said he hadnt seen the details of the policy but that it appears to work well with his companys plans Edison serves most of Orange County The more information we can provide will be of value to our customers Conroy said Beginning next month Edison customers will get their rotatingoutage group number on their bills Initially Edison will use the group numbers only to let customers know who might be next for blackouts once they start The company will use its Web site a telephone voice recording and broadcast media to get the word out Conroy however said the company is considering posting the group numbers for the first areas to be blacked out Officials have been reluctant to announce where outages will hit for fear of theft and vandalism San Diego Gas Electric which serves customers in south Orange County is already using pagers and email to notify business customers of powergrid conditions Spokesman Ed Van Herick said the ISO warning might give SDGE time to let block groups know where initial blackouts will hit Also Monday the Public Utilities Commission began accepting applications from businesses seeking exemptions from rolling outages Exemptions are only granted to customers who provide essential services su ch as hospitals fire and police stations and air traffic control facilities The PUC will consider exemptions for businesses whose shutdown would constitute a threat to public health and safety The deadline to apply is June A decision on which businesses qualify for exemptions is expected by Aug As part of the statewide effort to gear up for the expected summer blackout s the California Energy Commission on Thursday will test a new computer syste m that notifies cities counties special districts and some federal agencies in the state about energy conditions The goal of the

overly optimistic The Bure au of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission saying the commission hasnt responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line projects The audit said the PUC contributes to delays by failing to work closely wit h other agencies and in its decisionmaking relies too heavily on information supplied by the investorowned utilities Auditors asked by lawmakers to review the states energy regulators also said the California Energy Commissions extensive licensing methods slowed down plant approvals Of a dozen power plants licensed since only fou r were completed within the month rule thus slowing the states ability t o satisfy its electricity needs auditors said Gov Gray Davis energy advisers said Monday that the state is meeting its energy goals despite doubts raised by Connell and other critics Davis experts said their estimates are conservative though they rely heavily on Californians cutting back on their energy use this summer to hel p drive down prices The estimates assume the states consumers and businesses cut total electricity use percent and the state already is hitting that projection said chief energy adviser S David Freeman That just knocks the stuffing out of the demand Freeman said driving do wn prices as well A percent reduction in energy use saves the state far more than percent on its power purchases Freeman explained Thats because it comes straight out of the states purchases on the spot power market where electricity is far more expensive than power bought under longterm contracts Spot prices have dropped dramatically the past two weeks said Davis financial adviser Joseph Fichera The state has paid well under per megawatt hour during offpeak period s the past two weeks administration officials said at a news conference Fichera said that should help cut the average price to near the per megawatt hour average Davis plan assumes The officials refused to give specific price information or give the current average price Davis earlier said the state has paid as much as per megawatt hours during times o f peak demand In addition today the state will send Connell seven new power generation contracts that will help boost supply this summer Fichera said The state has in place contracts covering percent of the power the state needs to buy this month percent of next months power needs percent in July and percent in August Fichera said He said Davis energy experts also have been accurate in predicting the amount of the states power purchases despite Connells doubts In April they predicted the state would spend billion but actually spent billion a percent variance he said He said this months predictions so far are proving accurate as well Connell also said she will use her post on the states Board of Equalizatio n to host a hearing next month on whether generators should pay more property taxes because the value of their power plants has increased with soaring electricity prices Rate increase to hit harder than thought May By CHRISTOPHER MARTIN Bloomberg News SAN FRANCISCO Californias billion electricity price increase will affect more homes than expected because regulators used conflicting and outdated data in estimates utilities and regulatory officials say The California Public Utilities Commission voted last week to raise rates for customers of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Ediso n while sparing residential consumers who limit electricity use Gov Gray Davis and other state officials said half of residential customers would no t pay higher prices But PGE Californias largest utility said only about percent of residential customers or million homes will escape higher rates Edis on said percent of its residential customers will avoid the increase I believe there are a lot more residential consumers facing higher rates than the order shows said Commissioner Richard Bilas who voted against t he rate increase The PUC said half of all residential customers would be exempt from higher power prices Its analysis focused on electricity sales to homes rather th an the number of customers Under the PUCs method percent of Edison residential sales and percent of PGE sales would be exempt from rate increases Carl Wood a Davis appointee to the PUC who voted in favor of the increase said the commissions estimates will probably prove to be wrong Its very likely that more than half of residential consumers will see an increase especially this summer Wood said Energy Shortages Price Caps and Windfall Profit Taxes Lessons Never Learne d WASHINGTONBUSINESS WIREMay via NewsEdge Corporation By Craig G Goodman President of the National Energy Marketers Association and former Director of Oil and Energy Tax Policy in the Reagan and Bush Administrations In the last year we have experienced an energy crisis in California unprecedented prices for natural gas and high oil prices on top of six interest rate increases and four trillion dollars of lost wealth in the stock market History has taught us many lessons about energy policy particularly about making new laws and regulations in response to a crisis One thing our country indeed the global economy cannot afford is to repeat the energy policy mistakes of our past During the Oil Embargo of the s OPEC withheld oil supplies for a short time as a political gesture causing an oil price spike In response the US instituted the most complex scheme of energy price and allocation controls since World War II Energy price caps and their aftermath caused more than ten years of economic stagflation rising oil imports historic trade deficits massive wealth transfers in petrodollars to OPEC nations gasoline lines unprecedented interest rates and declining US energy production At the very time we needed more US energy supplies our energy price caps permitted oil produced everywhere else in the world to sell on world markets for as high as per barrel while US producers were forced to accept per barrel Once prices were deregulated prices fell to a low of per barrel yet at the same time the government taxed away approximately billion in capital needed to develop new energy supplies under the name of Windfall Profit Taxes As a result today we are nearly twice as dependent on imported oil than when the Embargo began Politicians live for the next election corporations live for the next quarters earnings and most of the rest of us live from paycheck to paycheck So how do we deal with the immediate political and the financial pain of energy price spikes shortages blackouts environmental sensitivities and its disproportionate impact on the poorest Americans Price Caps and Windfall taxes are political salves that feels good today and hurt tomorrow These are bad policies that sound great help politicians get elected and hurts the average consumer after the next election Are there any choices Must we repeat the failed policies of the s that ruined our economy for a decade No we dont There are quick effective and low cost policies to deal with our energy crisis Indeed there are numerous energy policy options that can yield very significant short and longterm paybacks to US Society Electricity represents the last vestige of years of the most complicated price and allocation controls known to man The retail US energy business is one of the largest single businesses in the world It represents nearly a trillion dollars a year of which energy is only about billion Currently however utility bills include all manner of products services information and technologies which are truly separate and very competitive businesses In the US there are very few true supply monopolies or demand monopsonies But between competitive sources of supply and demand there are two fullblown government sanctioned monopolies One is an interstate transmission monopoly and one is a local distribution monopoly Current rules governing these monopolies are incredibly complex hard to audit and impose enormously unnecessary costs on consumers in many different ways To help consumers and lower energy prices quickly monopoly barriers to new energy supplies must be repealed and aggressive conservation and load reduction incentives must be implemented immediately At the same time both state and federal policies must squeeze the monopoly profits out of the two monopolies between supply and demand so that more competitive supplies can meet demand at lower prices States must also stop granting utilities a monopoly or competitive advantages to provide competitive products services information and technologies Utilities should perform solely natural monopoly functions Regulated utilities should sell transportation services on a no frills cost of service basis Needed infrastructure investments should be given targeted performancebased incentives Regulations tariff structures interconnection rules back up rates and operational protocols should be uniform and designed to permit competitive suppliers to provide all other energyrelated products services information and technologies at competitive not monopoly prices Today we are witnessing the largest industrial restructuring in the history of this country possibly the world Every other industry that has deregulated has experienced to percent savings The US market for energy and related products services information and technology is nearly a trillion dollars a year Even a percent saving can save consumers as much as billion a year every year in

children the gift of a sustainable environment The open letter signed by heads of denominations and senior leaders across the spectrum of religious life questioned whether the administrations energy plan meets biblical standards of stewardship of Gods creation intergenerational equity and social and economic justice by depleting energy sources causing global warming fouling the air with pollution and poisoning the land with radioactive waste Stated the Right Rev Frederick Borsch of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles and cofounder of the Los Angeles Interfaith Environmental Council We the

shown mercy by detractors spanning the political spectrum But scant suggestions within th e Vice President Dick Cheneyoverseen tome have generated the opposition than has the call to extend the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC authority to acquire at a fair price private land for the public good to include transmission lines Why not transmission Dwight D Eisenhower used eminent domain with the nations interstate highw ay system and it has been used to expand the countrys natural gas pipeline system BushCheney say why not transmission lines The clash between the common good and individual rightsapparent since t he United States was foundedis moving into the power sector industry watc hers say And good or bad right or wrong may have little to do with whether or not the president can indeed bestow eminent domain concerning transmission lines on FERC There is a very strong case to be made for the use of eminent domain here but politically it clashes with property rights and states rights advocates said Pietro Novola senior fellow governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC A sleeping disaster Few people who comprehend that electricity is more than flipping a switch doubt the need for more transmission capacity But companies involved in trying to site new wires know its easier to construct a new power plant th an build transmission NIMBYism not in my backyard is in full bloom when it comes to new transmissionjust ask American Electric Power about its Wes t VirginiaVirginia decadelong fight to construct a new transmission line This is a sleeping disaster said Jonathan Gottlieb partner in the North American Energy and Utility Products Group at Baker McKenzie in Washingto n DC and former FERC attorney Granted you need additional supply you need conservation but you have a transmission system that is not connected and which cannot support demand The presidents energy policy report found that investment in new transmission between and had fallen to million from more th an billion In addition over the next decade only miles of new transmission are to be added to the gridjust of the existing miles of wire There is a very strong case to be made for the use of eminent domain here but politically it clashes with property rights and states rights advocates From the economics side this idea eminent domain makes sense said Cra ig Pirrong finance professor at the Olin School of Business at Washington University St Louis It makes sense but its not necessarily going to happen Coalitions of groups that normally would cross to the other side of the street to avoid each other suddenly are locking arms and singing Kumbaya Pirrong said there are three groups that certainly will look with disdain a t giving FERC the power to seize These are vertically integrated utilities state public utility commissions and environmentalists One could add to th at trio conservative western Republicansmembers of Bushs own partywho never have liked taking orders from those faraway Easterners Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an encroachment on their territories Pirrong said Its similar to the Baby Bell telephone companies opening the last mile of their service territorie s to competition has been extremely difficult The state commissions generall y are very responsive to the local utilities and of course you have the environmental interests NARUC is troubled The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners NARUC has registered its concern regarding expanded eminent domain power for FERC We are very troubled with the Presidents position said Chris Mele NARUCs legislative director Weve consistently held that the siting of transmission or generation belongs with the states We are adequately equipped to do it and all the infrastructure there we put in place But all that infrastructure was built prederegulation when each little utility constructed its state and federallyapproved monopolyfiefdom and lived in peaceful coexistence with its neighboring utility Those days excluding the effects of the California debacleare over in about half t he states with the remainder eventually to follow the same deregulation path Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an encroachme nt on their territories Proponents say just as the development of the automobile led to the need fo r an interconnected interstate highway system the movement toward deregulati on in the power industry is leading the country toward a true interconnected transmission system Gas considered national security issue And just as was the case when Ike conceived and started the ball rolling concerning the interstate highway system private property also has been seized for energyrelated projects Baker McKenzies Gottlieb pointed out that the development beginning in the s of the nations interstate pipeline system was looked at from the broader perspective of national security Transmission developed as a local function with a disconnected system Gottlieb said Just having eminent domain in its quiver of powers makes it easier for FERC to site pipelines the threat of its use is a powerful stimulus Washington Universitys Pirrong said Many industry watchers point to the greater good scenario If a new transmission line is needed for the greater good of many then the federal government should have the power to move things off center away from the parochial If you need interstate power the companies involved cannot buy the property and the project is for the greater good then sometimes the government has to use eminent domain said Jake Haulk an economist and managing director of the conservative think tank Allegheny Institute for Public Policy in Pittsburgh Pa We wouldnt think twice about taking property for an interstate highway Someone has to be able to step in to override purely local parochial feelings said Jerry Pfeffer energy industries advisor in the Washington DC office of the law firm Skadden Arps All politics is local While the political rhetoric heats up industry watchers say it all depends on which way the western Republican delegations fall inor out oflin e behind Bush Its a real test of Tip ONeils famous saying that all politics is local according to Pfeffer If the western Republicans vote as their constituent s wish they will vote against giving eminent domain power to FERC Or will they bite hard and vote with their president for that authority Its a classic case of local vs presidential politics

Mexico Seen As MediumTerm Solution To Californ ia Power Shortage Rate hikes bigger worry than blackouts poll says By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May The vast majority of Californians expect to be inconvenienced by power blackouts this summer but twothirds continue to be far more concerned abo ut higher electricity rates they believe are unjustified according to a Field Poll released Monday Meanwhile percent of the states residents say they have cut back their energy use since the crisis began and nearly twothirds believe they can conserve an additional percent to percent As they were at the outset of the crisis poll respondents remain skeptical of the power shortages root cause Nearly six out of say the crisis is an attempt by energy companies to increase rates rather than the results of a real market imbalance As the seriousness of the issue has gone up the cynicism has remained high said Mark DiCamillo director of the San Franciscobased poll The public still doesnt buy the claim that its supply and demand They think its an artificial crisis The poll results obtained by interviewing a crosssection of adults between May and Sunday are part of a special survey the Field Institute undertook to measure public opinion about the energy crisis Subsequent releases will survey attitudes about the available policy options and the policymakers who might exercise them Mondays results show Californians are reacting negatively to higher electricity rates even though the most recent increase has yet to appear o n their monthly bills In a finding nearly identical to Fields January survey percent are mor e concerned with higher rates than power blackouts And that does not bode well for the elected officials trying to solve the problem DiCamillo said Pocketbook issues such as rate increases he said focus more public opinion on the actors in this drama the politicians A majority percent believes the billion rate increase approved by t he state Public Utilities Commission last week for customers of Pacific Gas an d Electric Co and Southern California Edison was not justified and an identical proportion believes the rate increase will cause a somewhat or very serious problem in their households The proportion of people who believe the increases will cause very serious problems corresponds to their family income Among those earning or less percent believe the increases will cause very serious problems Te n percent of those earning or more believe very serious problems will occur In contrast percent say blackouts have caused a great deal or some inconvenience thus far although percent believe expected blackouts this summer will cause the same degree of inconvenience More lowincome residen ts percent say they will experience a great deal of inconvenience from summer blackouts compared with just percent of those in the and above category who feel the same way The poll shows that the percent of respondents who estimated they have conserved power have cut back on average about percent Gov Gray Davis has asked all residents and businesses to reduce power use by percent although Davis plan assumes a percent reduction Eightyfive percent also say they can conserve even more with additional savings on average amounting to percent Six out of believe the state can avoid blackouts this summer through conservation These numbers are a good guess as to what real conservation is being achieved and what is likely to be achieved and its not a huge amount DiCamillo said The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or Energy Digest Halfhour warning for blackouts Published May Grid operators are hoping to issue power blackout warnings a halfhour in advance but the new alerts would be educated guesses and blackouts might n ot follow The proposed warning system is expected to be approved Thursday by the boar d of the California Independent System Operator the Folsombased organizatio n that runs most of the states highvoltage transmission system Although an unknown number of the alerts will turn out to be false alarms this would be a huge step forward for businesses said Carl Guardino hea d of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a member of the ISO board For employers a halfhour is the time needed to fire up a major generator to power down an assembly line to have your employees save what they have on their computers he said By comparison the last two rounds of rotating blackouts came with two and sixminute warnings Guardino said The new system could be put in place by June and might also include expanded systems for giving email notifications of power alerts or potenti al blackouts ISO officials said Carrie Peyton Connell plans to borrow State Controller Kathleen Connell says Gov Gray Davis energy plan doesnt add up Connell said at a news conference Monday that the state will spend money on electricity at a faster rate than anticipated by Davis a fellow Democrat As a result Connell said she expects to borrow about billion this fall to avoid state budget cash shortages in the coming fiscal year We are virtually in the same kind of fiscal environment that we were in a bad budget year Connell said In recent years the state has regularly borrowed money through oneyear revenue anticipation notes to avoid cashflow problems The notes are paid off within a year when enough tax money flows to the state treasury But Connell didnt have to resort to borrowing this year because of plentif ul revenue and a healthy reserve Connell said the states energy purchases have changed the picture and called into question Davis assumptions The governors plan calls for percent of the power purchases in the first half of this year to be covered by lowercost longterm contracts As of last week only percent of the purchases were under contracts Connell said But Joe Fichera Davis financial adviser said that seven more longterm contracts for electricity during peak demand periods this summer will be delivered to Connells office today John Hill Suit to seek price caps The state Legislature plans to file suit today in federal court in a bid to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on power prices The lawsuit will argue that the commission has failed to ensure that Californians are paying just and reasonable rates as required under the Federal Power Act The suit is being filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DSherman Oaks Hertzberg said consumer groups and others are also expected to join the suit As evidence the suit will cite reports earlier this year by the California Independent System Operator that the states electricity market was not resulting in just and reasonable rates The ISO is responsible for running the states transmission grid The suit will cite evidence of how high power rates are causing harm to society Hertzberg said John Hill US attacks special rate Before the idea goes any further the federal government Monday asked state utility regulators to junk a proposal for a special highpriced federal energy rate In an emergency appeal federal officials asked the state Public Utilities Commission to take a special vote Thursday to drop the idea of even researching a pilot program calling it discriminatory and a waste of time As part of a vote last week that created new electricity rates the PUC als o launched a study into charging all federal facilities marketbased prices f or power a move widely seen as a dig against federal authorities who have refused state pleas to cap wholesale prices But three of the five PUC commissioners said at the time that they disliked the idea and would consider other options Given their reluctance it would be a waste of utilities scarce resources to even begin researching how to assess the special rate the Department of th e Navy wrote the PUC on Monday arguing on behalf of all federal executive agencies Carrie Peyton Whats the hangup Clotheslines save energy and money but they are considered unsightly by so me and are banned in many areas By Mary Lynne Vellinga Bee Staff Writer Published May Rising electricity rates have prompted Stacey Swett to seriously consider taking a step she finds somewhat distasteful hanging a clothesline in her back yard I dont really like the looks of them but you have to get past that we have a huge issue here with our SMUD bill Swett said The California Energy Commission touts clotheslines as a nearly costfree w ay to conserve electricity Statewide clothes dryers burn about megawat ts of electricity on a hot summer day which could be enough to avert a blacko ut on days when state power supplies are tight An electric dryer costs about a year to run A retractable clothesline will set you back about People appear to be getting the message Hardware stores report a sharp ris e in clothesline sales since the energy crisis hit People are going back to the old way of doing things said Dave Haskin owner of Broadway Hardware in Sacramento But the old way of doing things doesnt sit so well in some newer neighborhoods Where Swett lives in midtown she can decide for herself whether to take the plunge and pin up the bloomers But in many newer neighborhoods those governed by homeowners associations the practice is not allowed Swett works for the management company that runs the homeowners association for the gated Pocketarea subdivision of Riverlake In Riverlake it is against the rules to hang your laundry where your neighbors can glimpse it The same is true in Gold River Rancho Murieta Laguna West and Los Lagos the mansionstudded Granite Bay enclave where Sacramento Kings stars Chris Webber and Jason Williams live People think clotheslines are unsightly said Dan Kocal owner of the Folsombased Kocal Management Group His company manages the homeowners associations for communities in the Sacramento region Not one of them allows clotheslines unless they are shielded from neighbors views below th e fence line or behind a special enclosure When people buy into planned communities such as Gold River Los Lagos or S un City they agree to certain rules designed to keep the neighborhood looking neat and uniform Kocal said You agree that youre only going to park in the garage that youre not going to hang out clothes and that youre not going to paint your house purple Kocal said Clotheslines that can be seen from neighboring yards are banned by virtuall y all the California subdivisions and condominium complexes governed b y homeowners associations said Richard Monson president of the Pasadenabas ed California Association of Homeowners Associations We choose to live in neighborhoods that dont hang these things out Mons on said A few weeks ago Monson was quoted as saying that the sight of hanging laundry is akin to graffiti in your neighborhood Cartoonist Garry Trudea u since has devoted an entire week of his Doonesbury strip to lampooning neighborhoods that dont allow clothes to be hung out to dry Now Monson chooses his words more carefully When we talk about areas of communities that are less desirable we often associate those with undesirable items that are in proximity to the buildings he said He stan ds by his assertion that the sight of clothes flapping in the breeze could kno ck percent off property values Brian Rosebrock a supervisor at the new Home Depot in Elk Grove doesnt understand the stigma When he was growing up in a rural area outside New York City his mother always dried the familys clothes on the line Rosebrock still likes the smell of sundried clothes He hangs his jeans socks sheets and other cotton items in the back yard of his Rosemon t house Its just laundry Everybody is a little uptight here he said of Californians He may have a point Bruce Hackett professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California Davis said Californians harbor more negative attitudes toward clotheslines than do people in the Midwest where line drying is more of a tradition About years ago Hackett did a survey of UC Davis students and singlefamily households in Green Bay Wis At the time some students livi ng in married housing on the UC Davis campus were upset that they had to walk to an isolated screened area next to the trash bins to hang their laundry The housing office said clotheslines make the place look like a tenement Hackett said The attitude in Wisconsin was markedly different On wash day there were just clotheslines everywhere which is something y ou dont find here Hackett said One woman told me that when you move into a new home its not really your home until your clothesline is up and your clothes are on it In the wake of student complaints the university eventually changed the policy to allow the use of retractable clothes lines in the housing area Hackett said Leaders of several Sacramentoarea homeowners associations said they couldn t think of any instance in which a homeowner has asked permission to hang a clothesline or has gotten in trouble for using one I dont know of anyone who has a clothesline said David Brickell president of the Los Lagos Estates Homeowners Association He said the Los Lagos neighborhood is very concerned about the energy crisis and thus woul d certainly consider allowing clotheslines To save energy the subdivision has started turning off its entrance founta in at night and is considering buying a smaller fountain pump Monson head of the statewide association argued that there are many ways to conserve energy without resorting to the public airing of laundry Wet clothes can for instance be hung in the garage or the utility room he said The issue is not clotheslines the issue is conservation and homFeowne rs dont have to hang their clothes out of doors he said But some energyconscious citizens think discouraging the use of outdoor laundry lines is ridiculous given the states energy situation Jennifer Putnam recently purchased a large umbrellastyle apparatus to dry clothes in her Jackson back yard We were standing outside by the electric meter at one point two or thre e months ago My husband said Look at how fast that thing is going around I said The only thing on is the dryer During World War II we had to do certain things Putnam continued Now were looking at a power crunch were looking at saving an economy in California Thats critical Thats important I really dont think Gr anite Bay is going to turn into a slum because people put up things to dry their clothes on The Bees Mary Lynne Vellinga can be reached at or Dan Walters One year later we know it wasnt just a simple game of golf Published May California will mark but certainly not celebrate an anniversary this week It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over S an Diego and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power San Diego Gas Electric Co began charging its customers high marketoriented rates for juice It was the beginning of the California energy crisis or at least of public and political awareness that something was wrong And a year later every aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse We are paying times as muc h for power as we were two years ago We have amassed more than billion i n private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consume r power rates And we face potentially lifethreatening summer blackouts Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year They g o back to decisions in the s to stop major power plant construction and rely on conservation and alternative generating sources And they include a momentous decision in the mids to adopt a deregulation plan that was an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the mercy of outofstate generators Of more currency is what was and wasnt done in the last months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled and perha ps uncontrollable firestorm Gov Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays golf one hole at a time Unfortunately for Davis and for the state it was not a golf game but one of threedimensional and perhaps fourdimensional chess To manage the crisis effectively the Democratic governor needed the ability either personally or through trusted aides to pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole The golfing approach was evident from the beginning as Davis dealt with on ly the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved rather than embracing it wholly and actively Private and public energy experts warned that what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and proposed that the deregulation be suspended that rates be raised slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into longterm supply contracts to stabilize the market But Davis and his handpicked state Public Utilities Commission president Loretta Lynch stalled for time Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced the PUC voted to authorize longterm supply contracts at about cents a kilowatthour slightly higher than wholesale prices had been but ridiculously cheap by contemporary standards Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price escalation and quickly locked up longterm supplies but Lynch denounced th e commission action as a wrong turn that could lead to higher consumer bill s and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by Davis Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively Davis Lynch an d the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego rolling back retai l rates without addressing either supply or cost issues Within weeks privat e utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesal e costs skyrocketed Last summers failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment It s clear now for example that it was a mistake for the state to continue buying power at skyhigh rates when the utilities had exhausted their credi t Having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the market would bear A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud but didnt Davis is busily rewriting history and blaming others principally Republicans for t he dilemma But the governor cannot or should not escape the responsibility for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf or like so me routine political dispute and thus failing to apply the aggressive and sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset As Gen George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the Civil War the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage The Bees Dan Walters

blackouts mount residents are losing faith in their governments ability to deal with the one issue underlying this crisis and almost everything else that happens in the state population growth Energy and growth in fact are intertwined in the minds of everyday Californians to an extent not yet reflected in the debate inside the Capito l according to the results of a new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California More than threequarters of those surveyed statewide said they believe population growth contributed to the electricity shortage And even if the energy crisis fades people expect other problems associated with growth to worsen The crisis in other words has only heightened a sense that many people already had a feeling that Californias famous quality of life is threaten ed by rapid growth and our failure to provide the public works and services needed to make growth tolerable For the first time since the mids more people say the state is headed in the wrong direction

active role in guiding growth and development Yet an astounding percent said local governments in a region should work togeth er rather than each city and county deciding growth issues on its own But in a reflection of their lack of confidence in government percent said local citizens should make growth decisions by voting on ballot initiatives while percent said it would be better for local officials t o make those calls after thorough planning reviews and public hearings A little more than half percent said they would vote today for an initiative to slow the pace of development in their

on county utility plan Backers blame SDGE for bills demise in Assembly committee By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO An Assembly committee yesterday thwarted a bipartisan effort to ease the way for San Diego County to form a municipal utility district that backers say would bring residents cheaper and more reliable power Proponents of the plan said San Diego Gas Electric and its parent company Sempra engineered a political power play that ensured defeat of the proposal The utility was the main opponent Their lobbyists just got on this thing and killed it said Bill Horn chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors who attended yesterdays hearing before the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee They did a tremendous disservice to residents of San Diego County But a lobbyist for Sempra told the committee that forming a municipal utili ty wouldnt solve the energy crisis because it would do nothing to increase th e supply of electricity Were not in the middle of a utility crisis said lobbyist Cindy Howell Its a generation crisis The bill which would have applied only to San Diego County had strong bipartisan support from local officials including state Sens Steve Peace DEl Cajon and Dede Alpert DCoronado who took the unusual step of personally testifying before an Assembly committee But the proposal earned just three of the votes needed to clear the committee All of the votes came from Republicans The bills author Assemblyman Mark Wyland REscondido blasted the stockholderowned utility company for opposing the bill They simply dont want a threat to their ability to make as much money as they can on the backs of San Diego ratepayers he said Proponents say forming a public utility would allow residents to tap cheape r sources of power especially future hydroelectric power planned by the San Diego County Water Authority They argue that controlling some power plants could reduce the countys dependence on expensive electricity now purchased by SDGE on the wholesale market That in turn could lead to lower utility bills During the current energy crisis communities with publicly owned power including Los Angeles and Sacramento have paid much lower energy bills tha n communities served by investorowned utilities But current state law makes it difficult to create a local municipal utilit y because it requires a majority of voters to endorse the plan in an election in which at least twothirds of registered voters turn out As a practical matter that means approval likely would occur only during a presidential election when voter interest is high Peace said the current law was written for a reason to protect privately owned utilities The law was written on purpose by this Legislature to make it almost impossible to form a municipal utility district he said Wylands legislation Assembly Bill would have changed the law to allo w majorityvote approval in the new district without regard to how many vote rs turn out A proposal to create a municipal utility would have to go through months of local hearings before it could be placed on the ballot Wyland said he didn t expect the new agency to replace SDGE but merely to give residents more options over the long term Initially Sempra opposed the bill because it would have given the new publ ic agency the power of eminent domain to take over transmission lines and othe r facilities owned by SDGE At the hearing yesterday Wyland offered to strip eminent domain power from the new agency But Howell the Sempra representative still opposed the plan and argued th at there is no reason to change the voting requirement in the current law Forming a utility district she said is a significant step that should require high voter turnout The bill also drew opposition from unionized employees of Sempra Committee chairman Rod Wright DLos Angeles voted against the bill sayin g it was vague and that San Diego legislators should get a better idea of wha t they want to do He left open the possibility that he would support a proposal to allow the county to buy power but not to form its own utility Wright widely considered an ally of the privately owned utilities receive d last year in contributions from Sempra according to the Secretary of States Web site Other members of the committee objected to the proposed structure of the ne w utility which would be governed by a ninemember board of two supervisors two San Diego City Council members three council members from county citie s and two public members The proposal seemed to turn the political parties positions on public powe r upside down The measure failed to win any votes from Democrats who enthusiastically endorsed a new state power authority that allows California to finance buy and seize power plants But the plan was supported by three Republicans including Assemblymen Jay La Suer of La Mesa David Kelley of Idyllwild and Bill Leonard of Rancho Cucamonga Republicans opposed the state power authority with some calling it socialism Wyland said he may try to resurrect the proposal later in the year Business customers criticize proposed SDGE rate hike By Craig D Rose UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SDGEs commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an averag e of percent more to cover the states soaring cost of buying electricity At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers We need rates we can depend on said John Roberts who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos SDGE customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation and the utilitys residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state capped rates at cents per kilowatthour The SDGE cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as t he commission moves to increase SDGEs rates to levels now paid by customers of PGE and Edison which are about cents per kilowatthour higher Yesterdays hearing however was for commercial rates Roberts said his San Marcosbased irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition he said Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive If businesses leave the state theyll be without jobs and a savings on their power bills wont mean much Roberts said The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about people An additional hearing is scheduled at pm today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center N Coast Highway Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases Date s for those hearings have not been set State sends million to company part of April bill By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California million went to an Atlantabased firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month April Mirant formerly Southern Energy says more than half of the power came fro m three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific G as and Electric for million under a failed deregulation plan State Treasurer Kathleen Connell who displayed a blownup copy of the chec k at a news conference yesterday said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap longterm power contracts and will have to borrow more than the billion planned Connell an elected official who issues state checks said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday totaling billion provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity is dropping and that it will contin ue to drop through the summer But a consultant for Gov Gray Davis said the state which has more longte rm contracts than Connell has seen is on track to control power costs with th e aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners a Davis consultant Its the expect ed scenario The state plans to issue a bond of up to billion in late August that will repay the generalfund taxpayer money used for power purchases about billion so far The bond will be paid off over years by utility customer s Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to for ce disclosure Connell said she has received contracts from power suppliers She declined to release details of the contracts saying they are complicated a nd have varying prices Connell said the check for issued to Mirant Friday is one of t he largest she has written since taking office in This purchase was made entirely at spotmarket prices Connell said eve n though the Department of Water Resources the state agency that purchases power has an executed longterm contract with this company Mirant said in a statement that at the request of the state its marketing arm gave the state a helping hand by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state Weve done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf said Randy Harrison Mirants Western chief executive officer an d its wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negati ve light Mirant said its subsidiaries generated million megawatthours in Apri l while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost th e total sold to the state during the month to million megawatthours The firm said the power was sold for an average of per megawatthou r Thats below the average that the state expects to pay on the expensiv e spot market during the second quarter of this year from April through June But its well above the average price of per megawatthour said to have been obtained in the first round of longterm contracts negotiated by the state Mirant purchased three power plants from PGE capable of producing megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossilfuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide lowco st power to California The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than megawatts The largest group of plants megawatts went to AES Corp of Virginia Three Texas firms purchased plants producing megawatts The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state More heat means more air conditioning and a greater strain on the system But starting next month the states electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site power warnings when there is at least a percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next hours The ISO will issue a power watch when lesscritical shortages are anticipated in advance of high dema nd days The agency also plans to give a minute warning before it orders utilitie s to cut power to customers posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site Its Web site address is There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better Thats what we are trying to do ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley said ODonley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out including whether emails or pagers might be used In other developments in the electricity crisis About million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to households as part of the Power Walk program that began during th e weekend Members of the California Conservation Corps are going doortodoo r in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a million

The state has been importing abou t percent of its power Staff writer Karen Kucher contributed to this report say power woes very serious By John Marelius UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May The overwhelming majority of Californians now regard the states electricit y crisis as a serious problem but say they have not yet been greatly inconvenienced by it a new Field Poll has found The nonpartisan statewide survey found that while people believe the electricity problem is real they believe it stems more from an attempt by energy companies to drive rates up than from an actual shortage They are also far more worried about soaring electricity bills than the threat of blackouts And Californians offered contradictory views as to whether electricity conservation can head off blackouts this summer They believe all electrici ty consumers residents businesses and government can reduce their usage enough to avert blackouts But they also say they already have cut back the ir own usage about as much as they can In January the Field Poll surveyed public attitudes about the growing electricity crisis At the time percent characterized the situation as very serious Now the percentage of the population that considers the situation very serious has grown to percent Californians also hold a rather cynical view of the crisis Thirtysix percent say they believe it is the consequence of an electricity shortage but percent say it was caused by energy companies seeking to increase profits The Field Poll is based on telephone interviews with California adult s conducted between May and Sunday According to statistical theory the poll would be accurate percent of the time within a margin of error of percentage points So far the ill effects of the electricity crisis are ones Californians see m to be willing to live with But they worry that will not be the case much longer Eleven percent said they had been inconvenienced a great deal by blackout s But looking toward the summer percent said they expected blackouts to b e a major inconvenience Likewise percent said the electricity rate increases averaging perce nt that have taken effect have been a very serious problem for them If rates were to go up another percent percent would regard that as a serious problem Opinion is divided over the merits of recent rate increases approved by the state Public Utilities Commission Fortyone percent called them justified and percent called them unjustified Its not overwhelmingly panned which I suppose is about as well as could be expected on an issue like this said Mark DiCamillo associate director of the Field Poll Its almost like a tax increase The public doesnt want i t its just whether they think its justified or not Looking ahead percent say blackouts are the greatest threat posed by th e electricity crisis But more than twice as many percent say they are more concerned about escalating electricity bills By a significant ratio percent to percent Californians believe additional conservation measures by all electricity users can eliminate the need for summer blackouts But when it comes to their own electricity consumption they say they alrea dy have cut back significantly and cant do much more Californians say they have reduced their household electricity usage by an average of percent They said they could cut back by another percent in their homes without causing serious problems If the state is looking and the governor is looking for redoubled efforts its going to be painful because the public thinks we can do a little bit more but not a lot said DiCamillo Governor told to try seizure in power war By Philip J LaVelle UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May A major San Diego business group urged Gov Gray Davis yesterday to take emergency steps in the energy crisis including seizing power plants an action the governor said may be in the cards Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego Building Owners and Managers Association overseers of about commercial properties here The meeting at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown was closed to the media In remarks to reporters later Davis repeated his hard line against outofstate energy producers relating a threat made to a dozen power executives in a private meeting May I told the generators face to face as close as I am to you Gentlemen you are going to lose your plants and Im going to sign a windfallprofits tax unless you help us get through this summer without blackouts and without staggering prices Davis also said he told them You know youve been ripping us off acting in a predatory manner If you do it this summer you leave me no choice but to take your plants and sign a windfallprofits tax So the ball is in your court gentlemen Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had a frank exchange with Davis We want to do our fair share on conservation but were also concerned about the supply side he said The group strongly urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary includin g seizing plants Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of conservation measures Yet some cannot be implemented without state intervention she said For example Davis urged that airconditioning thermostats be set at degrees but a lot of our leases dont permit it she said While in San Diego Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree fro m Scripps Research Institute Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES The head of the California Public Utilities Commission pro vided a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduc ed electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices While testifying before the committee Friday PUC President Loretta Lynch displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last November According to the graphs after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates We certainly see a pattern Lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers Many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent California Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production Lynch said She would not identify the power plants involved however Lynch did say th at they are owned by at least two companies Sen Joseph Dunn who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said Lynchs testimony on its face is very damning He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior During a break in Fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of majo r power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits There has been no collusion said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy Producers Association The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin State to Issue Warnings of Power Outages Electricity CalISO says it will try to give residents and businesses hour notice of probable blackouts By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer courtesy of the energy crisis The Freeway is jammed theres a slim chance of showers and oh by the way theres a likelihood of blackouts By the end of this month the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the states power grid expects to issue hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected It is also piecing together a hightech system to give businesses government officials and the public at least a halfhour notice of a probab le blackout in their area Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air but CalISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more tha n customers a minute via fax and phone and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers CalISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses particularly those in the Silicon Valley that lastminute blackouts were costing California millions The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies o f electricity If Californians electricity use pattern is similar to last years CalISO has projected the state could suffer days of blackouts making increased notification crucial With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the droughtstrick en Pacific Northwest and no new power plants coming online until July the agency calculates that there will be a supplydemand gap in June of megawattsenough power to supply million homes A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted tha t California will experience up to hours of blackouts this summer The weather report and traffic report are good analogies people know they are not accurate but if a blackout really means a lot to them they will check in said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network who serves on the CalISO board Details remain sketchy and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday But a Web page called Todays Outlook on the agencys Internet site wwwcaisocom will be created to illustrate hour by hour how much electricity is available during a hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electrici ty conditions a day in advance They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather but they also will define the level of emergenc y that is expected A power watch will be sounded during stage and stage shortages and a more serious power warning if there is a chance of a stage which often results in blackouts Stage emergencies occur when power reserves drop below stage and stage Most important CalISO is pledging to provide minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric among others In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media CalISO will sound alarms to select email addresses and pager numbers on blast lists or massive computer databases that it will assemble The technology is there This is a war California is in and we shoul d be deploying hightech solutions said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the CalISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification Every time California goes black the economy see s red Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving ju st two to sixminute warnings before blackouts not nearly enough to react A twominute warning may be sufficient in a football game but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public he said Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the mos t of the warnings Florio said residents also will benefit It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners but if someone works at home and sets it up to get an email notice they can take advantage he said In other energy news Monday the woman in charge of paying California s power bills warned that a billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow billion more before it runs out of cash in February Calling a news conference in the capital state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov Gray Davis financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis The plan assumes the billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases an d cover future power buys for the next two years Connells opinion is notable because as the states chief check write r the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through longterm contractsdata that Davis has largely kept secret Davis advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connells warnings Businesses May Seek Blackout Exemption Energy PUC will accept new applications which would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writer The San Francisco Giants want one and so presumably do most other California businesses an exemption from the rolling blackouts that experts say are all but certain this summer But whether operating on a baseball diamond or in more mundane venues far from the bright lights of pro sports few businesses will be granted su ch waiversand then only to minimize threats to public health and safetyund er a process detailed Monday by the California Public Utilities Commission It would be nice in a perfect world if we could exempt everyone who asks from rolling blackouts Unfortunately we cant do that Commissioner Carl A Wood said in announcing the procedure for applying for blackout exemptions The PUC already exempts a fairly lengthy list of those whose services are needed to protect public health and safety including fire and police stations and acutecare hospitals Energy experts are predicting blackouts this year ranging from a total of hours at the most optimistic to hours or more based on such factors as historic patterns of electricity usage forecasts for hot weathe r and expectations of diminished hydroelectric imports from out of state Any new business exemptions which would start no sooner than August would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety That means a business would not be granted an exemption from outages just because it fears revenue loss Wood said at a Los Angeles news conference Residential customers will be unable to apply for the exemptions Nevertheless many already enjoy blackout protection by quirk of location if they share a circuit with an exempt customeror if they are customers of t he Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and municipal utilities such as those in Glendale and Burbank that do not rely on the statewide power grid for electricity The PUC can approve only a limited number of blackout exemptions Wood said because to maintain system reliability a pool of customers representing at least of total system load must be available for rollin g power outages Statewide about of system load is exempt from blackouts in the territories served by the three big investorowned utilities Edison Internationals Southern California Edison PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Sempra Energys San Diego Gas Electric This is not an exercise in determining who is most affected economically by rolling blackouts Everyone is affected economically by rolling blackouts Wood said The PUC has set up a Web site wwwrotatingoutagescom and tollfree number for businesses seeking information and applications The deadline to apply is pm June Completed applications will be reviewed by an engineering consulting firm Exponent Inc of Menlo Park Calif which will develop a priority li st based on risk to public health and safety Only businesses that have applied would be considered for exemptions Wood said explaining that the commission will not excuse entire industries The PUC is expected to vote on the exemptions by Aug Wood said several companies already have applied including the operators of Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco home of the Giants major league baseball team Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency Power Lawmakers try a new idea a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose dang er to people law enforcement and even water supply By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOLegislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursin g homes children in day care centers law enforcement and its ability to fig ht crime and the states drinking water supplies Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs the lawsuit takes a new tack homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California s energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set just and reasonable wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks and the city of Oakland A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California the draft says The public health safety and welfare of the states million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats Until now most California officials including Gov Gray Davis have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state which has spent more than billion buying electricity since January In the lawsuit Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes frail elderly people are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks drip IVs dialysis machines and electricitypowered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men women and children with disabilities the suit says They represent an imminent threat to life health and independence Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the US th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco bypassing the federal trial court Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso a professor at McGeorge Law Scho ol in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue But after Cotchett spoke with him Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit Lets face it said Kelso a Republican this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months Watching the Water Supply The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give t o consumers If the water looks cloudy or dirty the warning says you should no t drink it The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality they can boil it or add eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water and let it sit for minutes Most water agencies have backup generators But the suit says that i f an agencys water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage a twohou r blackout can result in twoday interruptions in providing safe drinking wat er because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system California will forecast blackouts and warn the public JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer Tuesday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT AP Eds PMs SACRAMENTO Calif AP The operator of Californias electricity grid is offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint planning to give t he public a halfhours warning before shutting off the lights Beginning May the Independent System Operator also plans to issue warnings similar to weather advisories hours before expected blackouts Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts The utilities have also resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals Definitely its a good idea said Shirley Starr a racetrack employee in the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead If I know its going to happen I won t defrost the refrigerator or something Like some business customers and consumer groups she wondered if minute s warning would be enough A lot of people if they are at work a half hour isnt going to do any good Starr said I think it should be more than minutes said George Aguilar an animal control officer in El Monte It should be at least eight hours Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer The states power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict The outages last to minutes and then skip to anoth er neighborhood Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights trapped people in elevators and caused business losses by bringing production lines to a halt People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters I t will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the gri d could be headed toward blackouts The ISO will issue minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit Its better than no notice said John Handley of California Independent Grocers He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and even move items to cold storage if necessary Once the power goes out we cant ring anyone up Handley said Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted witho ut risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce said Brad Ward president a nd chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California For example a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piec e of metal If power is shut off suddenly the acid might not be removed in time and the piece would be ruined This is really really good news Ward said The ISO said it also is looking into hightech ways it can get word of an impending

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews State regulators admitted yesterday that almost twothirds of Northern California power customers will be hit with higher electricity rates contradicting an earlier claim that half of all consumers would be untouche d by rising bills Meanwhile officials and utility executives said bills could go even higher if lawmakers try to reduce the number of households suffering rate hikes A preliminary vote on the matter by the state Senate Energy Committee is scheduled for today In adopting the biggest rate increase in California history the Public Utilities Commission told consumers that half of all residential ratepayers would be unaffected by higher bills This is roughly the case for customers of Southern California Edison but Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that at least percent of its residential customers will experience higher bills as of June I never had a great deal of confidence that percent of people would be exempt from rate increases said PUC member Carl Wood I was surprised by the percent number Nevertheless Wood was one of three Democratic appointees on the five memb er commission who voted in favor of the rate plan which included a tiered system under which the heaviest power users would face the steepest increas es in monthly bills Residential customers who can stay within percent of socalled baseline usage would experience no rate increases Weve been sold a false bill of goods said Medea Benjamin head of the S an Francisco consumer advocacy group Global Exchange The PUC made a huge poi nt of saying that half of all people would be unaffected They cant promise o ne thing and then do something else RUSH JOB Regulators admit they were in a hurry to get a rate system adopted in time for PGE and Edison to begin collecting the higher fees in their June bills For this reason they went ahead with last weeks vote even though it was apparent that less than half of all residential ratepayers would be able to stay within percent of baseline as outlined by the tiered system If we wanted to do it perfectly we would never have gotten it done Wood said We cant get the baseline adjusted before the end of the summer eve n at an accelerated pace Because electricity rates have been linked to baseline usage this once esoteric calculation has taken center stage in Californias energy mess BASELINE USAGE The baseline usage figure included on PGE bills was devised nearly years ago to define the amount of fuel necessary to supply a significant portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer according to the Public Utilities Code It includes several variables such as climate time of year and type of fuel However the last time regulators tabulated baseline numbers was in meaning that the figures on most peoples bills no longer reflect actual power consumption This was precomputers preInternet and pre a lot of other things that a re now in the house said Richard Bilas a Republican PUC member who opposed last weeks rate hike The average baseline for most households is about kilowatt hours per month according to the numbers To be exempt from rate hikes a household thus would need to use no more than kilowatt hours However regulators and utilities now say that actual power usage for the typical home is at least kilowatt hours per month well above most peoples baseline amounts Its not possible to stay within percent of that Bilas said I know I cant do it NEW BASELINE CRITERION With regulators set to begin reexamining baseline numbers Thursday the Senate Energy Committee is seeking ways to make the tabulation more equitab le by adding a new criterion to the figure household size Now a family of five with computers electronic games and almost roundthe clock power consumption would have the same baseline as the bachelor living next door who is rarely home That disparity would be addressed by a bill to be submitted today by Sen Jackie Speier DHillsborough who wants household size to be a factor in determining baseline with the baseline limit rising in proportion to the number of people in the residence Baseline is a totally unfair measure of the number of people in a household she said Families are severely impacted Robert Herrell Speiers staff director said state authorities would rely on selfcertification for each household to accurately report its number of occupants essentially the honor system The last thing you want to do is create baseline police he said Hopefully people wouldnt game the system But Akbar Jazayeri director of revenue and tariffs for Southern California Edison said that even if regulators succeed in adjusting baseline figures to better reflect household size and usage levels this only would increase th e number of ratepayers who can stay within percent of revised limits That means more people would be exempt from rate increases Jazayeri observed There would be less revenue from ratepayers so you would have t o get other people to make up for it In other words another rate increase Well need another rate increase if we mess around with baseline warned the PUCs Bilas Email David Lazarus at Who uses how much Most PGE residential customers do not stay within percent of baseline power usage which means they will be subject to a rate increase Customers as a percentage of baseline use Up to Up to Up to More than Source PGE Chronicle Graphic Energy crisis not real states residents say But poll results show most expect more blackouts Carla Marinucci Chronicle Political Writer Tuesday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews The overwhelming majority of Californians say the states power crisis is very serious and blame the big energy companies for creating and manipulating shortages results of a new Field Poll show In the publics view this is a manufactured crisis not a real crisis Mark DiCamillo director of the statewide Field Poll said yesterday That cynicism permeates a lot of things The public is no t sold on the explanations as to why were in the crisis were in The poll results released yesterday after a year of energy woes underscor e Californians increasing concerns about the energy crisis and their growing list of personal conservation efforts to deal with it The poll of California adults was conducted May to Sunday CONSUMPTION CONSERVATION In what may be the first such tally of statewide conservation efforts California residents said they reduced their power consumption by an averag e of percent an effort motivated by the energy crisis The new poll results also dramatized that Californians are very attentive to news reports and information about the energy crisis as a way of bracing themselves for the effects of increased rates and power outages But so far it is not the politicians who are the object of their wrath it is big energy DiCamillo said Theyre the bad guys he said But in the publics view no one has bee n able to stop them No one is winning this The findings of the latest Field poll Three quarters of the Californians polled deemed the energy crisis very serious and percent said somewhat serious compared with just percent who said they didnt see it as a problem That is similar to a California Public Policy Institute survey released Monday that showed percent of those polled believe the energy crunch is a big problem Despite the widespread media coverage of the effects of blackouts many Californians said they were not personally inconvenienced the poll results showed Just percent reported being inconvenienced a great deal by blackouts and another percent say they have been affected some by the problems compared with percent who said theyd had a little inconvenience and percent who said none Almost half said they had no t experienced a blackout at all Onethird said they expected to be inconvenienced a great deal by blackouts during this coming summer the poll showed Only in residents say rate increases have so far created serious problems for them and nearly half say they havent been affected at all the poll showed But most Californians say they are fully aware new rate increases have been passed by the Public Utilities Commission and you can see the pain level goes up fairly dramatically said DiCamillo Theyre bracing themselves for the worst WHAT LIES AHEAD DiCamillo said the poll results confirm how deeply Californians fear what m ay lie ahead in the energy arena Up to this point rate increases and blackouts havent really touched a strong nerve but they really feel its coming he said They dont know how it will affect them Theyre looking at the politicians as if theyre impotent in the face of these changes

San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews State legislators said yesterday that they will investigate charges power companies manipulated electricity prices by repeatedly ramping the output o f their plants up and down and creating artificial shortages Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana Orange County who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices called the ramping allegations first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday outrageous acts of manipulation Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law legislati on could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future Were looking at it yes from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced t o render it a violation for future such acts Dunns committee already has been investigating charges that power generato rs gamed the wholesale energy market to boost their profits The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants sometimes several times within an hour Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants The senate committee which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power generating companies Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine whic h plants employed the ramping tactic He added that the issue would be examin ed in a public hearing in the coming weeks Meanwhile pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns has narrowed its focus It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offlin e during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal However Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diegoarea plant coowned by Dynegy Inc of Houston and NRG Inc

operator may send voice email messages Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Tuesday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Sacramento Californians will receive minutes warning that blackouts may be imposed enough time it is hoped to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection the states power grid managers said yesterday The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms We want a system that is proactive said Carl Guardino an ISO board memb er and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes warning Two minutes may be fine in a football game but its not fine for Californias economy or safety ISO officials also said they are examining hightech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass emails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages The plan detailed in a report issued yesterday still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a buyers cartel that would refuse to pay fo r power when prices become too high Its not the report I was expecting but minutes of notice is certainly better than two said Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray No matter how y ou slice it this summer is going to be miserable The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cos t the state economy billion said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses In this electrically unreliable world any notification manufacturers can get is good said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the association While minutes wont be enough for some for most manufacturers it will be sufficient The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmaker s regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts said Michael Florio an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network There are bigger public policy ramifications Florio said The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the changes are just updates of policies already in place WARNING OF PROBABLE BLACKOUTS The minute advancenotification system scheduled to go into effect earl y next month would warn of probable blackouts including the amount of loa d that will have to be curtailed in each service area Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts The utilities also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much i s available It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly email This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations said ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley Also planned by the ISO is a Power WatchPower Warning system that would provide a hour notice of highdemand days Under the twotiered system a Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a percent chance of a Stage Three aler t With one report suggesting California may see as many as hours of rolli ng blackouts this summer lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to ma ke the outages easier for power customers to cope with The idea of a buyers cartel the subject of a Capitol hearing today would have California in partnership with other states set a firm ceiling o n what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity The tradeoff would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if th e state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS Meanwhile Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno will introduce a bill today that would require the states utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block For example a customer located in Block of Pacific Gas and Electric Co s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June if blackouts are needed that day Right now every day is a potential blackout day Briggs said This way people would know when their potential days are On alert When demand is high the ISO will forecast peak demand power supply and weather hours in advance A power watch will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Sta ge system is within of running out of power or Stage system is withi n of running out of power A power warning will be issued when there is at least a chance of a Stage alert demand is within of supply Who calls a blackout Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the states power consumption When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below percent of available capacity the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice Officials said this week they would give minutes notice before blackouts begin The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut Q Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long A Thats up to the utilities PGE has divided its million customers into blocks each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time The blocks are defined by PGEs network of circuits rather than by geography Thus neighborhoods in San Francisco Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously Q How many users are blacked out at once A Each of PGEs blocks represents about megawatts of electricity A megawatt is enough electricity to power homes If PGE is told to cut more than megawatts it can shut down two or more blocks at a time PGE also can bla ck out smaller portions within each block if the ISOs requirements are for le ss than megawatts Q How is power shut off A This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand Q How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected A A total of customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan Q Which block of customers will be blacked out next A Some or all customers in Block Q How do I know what block Im in A Look for the words Rotating Outage Block followed by a number on your bill If it says Block you share an electrical circuit with a hospital police station or other essential service that is normally exempt from service cuts Q What should I do when the lights go out A Power experts advise Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damagecausing power surge s when service is restored Leave one light on to indicate when the electrici ty is back Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out Treat all intersections as a fourway stop To protect food open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutel y necessary Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if only your hom e is affected It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PGE or your city electrical bureau When the power returns turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges Dont plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can sen d a highvoltage current through the system that can electrocute power worker s

energy disease I dont mean blackouts and brownouts I mean higher electricity prices which are all but inevitable Retail prices are regulated in most parts of the country But when utilitie s pay more for wholesale power they have to pass it on How much prices rise will depend partly on whether we learn again to conserve Consumers bought into conservation after the energy shocks of the s and early s We not only turned down thermostats and insulated the attic we embraced government intervention and technological change Federal energy standards brought forth more efficient refrigerators and air conditioners New building codes made homes and offices less expensive to heat cool and light Rebate programs helped people buy better lightbulbs and appliances Electricity use grew more slowly than the economy did But in the late s with prosperity in full swing demand began catching up with supply Consumers stopped worrying about their energy bills Hightech businesses gobbled megawatts for lunch Utilities and states California among them closed or scaled back thei r conservation programs Were all freemarket maniacs now The markets were supposed to create efficiency unaided But they havent So while we work out the problems and wait for new plants to come online we need to spread the available power around Energy conservation needs a big push The Bush administration has blinders on when it cuts conservation spending and downplays the need But a marketbased question has also entered the conservation debate Would we save power if it were priced in a different way Most consumers dont realize that the wholesale price of power changes at various times of day Prices spike when demand is high say on summer afternoons and fall at night when most offices have closed But most of us pay a constant price per hour whether we use expensive hour s or cheap ones So we have no incentive to conserve power during hours of hi gh demand Marketbased pricing is intended to get you to think twice before using pow er during those expensive peaks There are three main approaches to this today CHANGING THE FIXED PRICE Many utilities today charge more in the hot summe r months than in the winter months Georgia Power goes further raising you r summer price as you use energy more In the winter your rate for extra kilowatthours declines VOLUNTARY TIMEOFUSE PROGRAMS You pay the most for power during weekday hours and the least on weekends and overnight Oregon will introduce a statewide timeofuse program in October Niagara Mohawk in Syracuse NY has consumers on timeofuse Ahmad Faruqui of the industrys Electric Power Research Institute estimates that a welldesigned timeofuse program could cut residential peak demand by about percent In California that could reduce energy costs by percent over the summer So far however these programs havent persuaded many people to run their washing machines at night Saving or isnt worth the hassle says Mike OSheasy Georgia Powers manager of product design REALTIME PRICING Here the utility varies your price per kilowatthour during the day as its own prices change Using a smart meter and smart thermostat you could program your water heater or air conditioner to turn off automatically during times when power costs the most Many businesses already pay on realtime How consumers like realtime pricing remains to be seen Georgia Power trie d it years ago and dropped it But Gulf Power in Pensacola Fla rolled out newer technology last year an d thinks it has a hit About customers are already online with more on the waiting list even though the smart meters cost them a month People like the control over their power bill says Gulfs Margaret Neyma n general manager of marketing She says customers are saving percent which more than covers their participation cost Puget Sound Energy in Bellevue Wash has enrolled more than customers in a smartmeter program Theyve been getting reports showing when they use power the most and what it costs to deliver This month the utility started tying its smart meters to timeofuse pricing Customers pay less during nighttime hours all day Sundays and holidays Consumer and environmental groups generally havent supported marketbased pricing for homes They blame high prices in part on market manipulation and dont want the power sellers to profit from it They have a case But blackouts and brownouts

literally in a war with energy companies who are pricegouging us the governor said shaking with something that looked an awful lot like emotion Many of those companies are in Texas In typical Davis style the governor is a little late in declaring war on Texas If he had been president in he would have spoken of that day o f infamy in It also was a typical Davis halfmeasure He didnt declare war on all of Texas just the Texans who poll badly in California Those would be George W Bush and his friends and contributors who cut off our power robbed us and then used us as an example of why the nation need s holes punched in Alaska and hundreds of Homer Simpsons put in charge of nuclear fuel rods Davis isnt the type to boldly declare unlimited war on all of Texas certainly not Austin City Limits chili and the Texans we love like Will ie Nelson Tommy Lee Jones Charlotte Mailliard Shultz and Willie Brown But Davis had a Texas stereotype in mind as he spoke of the hardscrabble hombres in Houston highrises who are smart and mean and are holding us up longdistance Yep its as if Texas is saying to California Your money o r your lifestyle Davis said he would retaliate each month by naming a Texas corporation pig of the month Yeah thatll hurt those guys at Reliant Energy and Enron Having Gray Davis on your side in a dustup with a bunch of Texans is like having the head of the high school av

Blackout alerts forecasts proposed Posted at pm PDT Monday May BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News Under pressure to give more notice before pulling the plug Californias power grid managers Monday proposed issuing alerts a halfhour before blackouts and forecasting the likelihood of outages a day in advance The Independent System Operators proposal heartened business leaders who s ay unexpected rolling blackouts have cost them millions of dollars But the proposal disappointed consumer advocates and some lawmakers who hop ed grid officials would consider their suggestion to schedule rolling blackout s days or weeks in advance Grid officials compared their proposal to the weather forecasts that alert Midwesterners to tornadoes and cautioned that the predictions are subject to change Its akin to a severe storm watch and a severe storm warning said Greg g Fishman spokesman for the ISO which will consider the proposal Thursday We try to give as much hard information as soon as we can But there are days where those things are going to change very quickly Business leaders said a halfhour warning even if its a false alarm woul d be better than the two to six minutes they got during the last round of rolling blackouts in April Were happy with what the ISO is trying to do said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association It s making a bad situation a little better But critics said the proposal changes little and with frequent blackouts expected this summer urged the state to instead schedule them in advance Its actually quite distressing and disappointing said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which proposed scheduling blackouts If the public is looking for better information on blackouts theyll have to look elsewhere State Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach whose energy committee is considering notification issues today agreed Its not the report I was expecting but minutes of notice is certainl y better than two Bowen said The idea of scheduling blackouts is gaining ground among state lawmakers w ho say it would let people know when to expect outages and also force down runaway power prices by dampening demand The grid operator didnt propose scheduled blackouts because lawmakers havent yet agreed on the concept Its in the talking stage Fishman said Theres nothing firm Rolling blackouts in which utilities cut power from one block of customers for an hour or so and then move to the next block protect the system from total failure when demand threatens to overwhelm supplies Systemwide failu re could take days to fix Bad summer forecast Californians have had six days of rolling blackouts this year and will like ly see many more this summer as powerguzzling air conditioners drive demand as much as megawatts over available supplies A megawatt can power about homes The ISO highlights the potential for blackouts through progressive emergenc y stages Stage the highest level indicates rolling blackouts are possibl e Grid managers alert utilities and public safety officials to conditions by email pager telephone radio and Internet postings and notify the publi c through news broadcasts To date twothirds of consumers say theyre more concerned about power prices than rolling blackouts according to a Field Poll released today Bu t more than seven in expect to be inconvenienced by the outages expected this summer the poll found People in general are much more willing to tolerate blackouts if they kno w theyre going to happen said Guy Phillips energy aide to Assembly Speak er Pro Tem Fred Keeley DSanta Cruz The nature of the electric system makes advance notice of blackouts difficult grid officials said California is so short of power that weathe r changes and power plant shutdowns can dramatically affect the outlook On Monday the state avoided blackouts amid soaring temperatures because of power imported from other states and cooler weather in Southern California said ISO spokeswoman Lorie ODonley That could change as Southern Californ ia heats up today and Wednesday but blackouts arent expected barring a sudd en plant failure or drop in imports she said National Weather Service forecasters expect a high of degrees in San Jos e today with a low in the upper s tonight Under Mondays ISO proposal grid managers would commit to issuing a minute notice of probable interruptions identifying the affected utilities and how much power they must cut It still would be up to the utilities to determine which areas would be affected The ISO also would issue hour grid advisories If the ISO expects a Stag e or emergency the next day grid managers will issue a Power Watch If there is a percent or greater chance of a Stage emergency the next day the ISO will declare a Power Warning In addition the ISO would bolster the system conditions report on its Web page by adding available supply figures The report now lists only actu al and forecast demand Customers also would be able to sign up for hourly email updates ISO officials also are looking into contracts with notification services offering to alert customers to grid conditions by request through phones faxes emails or pagers We spent the last four months designing this with businesses for businesses said ISO board member Carl Guardino who also heads the Silic on Valley Manufacturing Group The blackouts that hit the Bay Area on June cost Silicon Valley business es million Guardino said adding that he expects the ISO to approve the proposals by months end Chance to do something Every time the lights go out companies see red Guardino said Half an hour actually gives you a chance to do something You can deploy police officers to intersections You can power down assembly lines Others say thats not enough I want days warning said Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno who plans to introduce a bill today that would schedule each utility outage blo ck for a day when blackouts are possible That would help farmers who must have power on specific days for water delivery and crop processing Briggs said State Sen Dede Alpert DSan Diego has a bill scheduled for discussion today calling for the state to set a ceiling on what it will pay for power and to schedule outages the next day if there arent enough sellers at that price Guardino said the ISO isnt ruling out scheduled blackouts but is concerne d that such an approach could result in unnecessary outages Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DVan Nuys believes the ISO proposal is a good idea in any case Doing everything we can to let people know whats likely to happen is important said Paul Hefner a Hertzberg aide whether or not we can go forward with some sort of scheduled blackout Blackout season

accept applications this week from businesses claiming they must be exempt from having their lights go out Temperatures of over degrees in the Central Valley and degrees in th e Bay area are expected today Southern California will bear the brunt of the heat Tuesday so energy demand could be diffused throughout the state We do expect this upcoming heat wave to be brutal said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator whi ch manages the states electric grid But we cant say for sure well be able to avoid blackouts The good news is that the grid operator expects more than megawatts o f power to be online this week compared with two weeks ago when California endured modest blackouts for two straight days Still about megawat ts of electricity or onequarter of the states capacity will be out of service McCorkle said The ISO plans to release a report today on how scheduled blackouts might work The report is a response to a bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alper t DCoronado that would allow the grid operator to refuse to buy power that is considered too expensive and instead call for rolling blackouts The PUC which has been besieged by consumer complaints might begin hearin gs into inequities in the baseline allocation on residential utility bills Consumers are complaining that baseline which guarantees a subsistence lev el of electricity based on various climate regions throughout the state is no t consistent with energy usage Cheney Forget price caps OPEC pressure Vice president calls for more refineries and review of fuelcontent rules May By BRIGITTE GREENBERG The Associated Press WASHINGTON Capping electricity prices or pressuring OPEC to cut oil pric es will not solve US energy problems Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday in defending a Bush administration energy plan that stresses production ove r conservation While Democrats want immediate relief for Californias power crisis there were few encouraging words from Cheney who led a task force that developed the Bush plan They got into trouble in California over a period of years and its going to take two or three years to get out of it Cheney told CBS Face the Nation There are going to be blackouts this summer For the short term the administration has approved Gov Gray Davis reques ts to expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal offices in the state to reduce energy consumption this summer by percent Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said she was appalled that President George W Bush is not considering price caps or investigating companies that she said are charging exorbitant prices for electricity She noted that both Cheney and Bush are former oil company executives Its really rather stunning because those of us who are living through thi s have suggested many things Boxer told CBS So the vice president sits ve ry coolly and I admire his cool but he really sounds like an oil man not a vice president charged with helping the people If dairy farmers sought as much profit as oil companies in some cases percent a gallon of milk would cost she said Cheney said the answer to longterm price stability lies in building more o il refineries in the United States and in reviewing a system whereby different states require different blends of fuel some mixed with the corn additive ethanol for example to meet cleanair standards Capping prices would not increase the supply of energy or reduce demand Cheney said We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there is some kind of conspiracy whether its the oil companies or whoever it might be instead of dealing with the real issues Cheney told NBCs Meet the Press He criticized Davis for what he called a harebrained scheme to use the states budget surplus to buy power Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss said Congress should look into at least temporarily suspending the federal gas tax which is cents per gallon Cheney however said that would pose problems for the nations highway tru st fund which relies on that tax to build and maintain the countrys transportation infrastructure Describing himself as a pretty good environmentalist Cheney also respond ed to criticism from some environmental groups that he did not meet with them before issuing the energy plan because he is beholden to energy producers w ho gave millions of dollars to the Bush campaign I couldnt begin to sit down with all of those various groups I didnt ha ve time he said A nuclear rebirth Despite obstacles it should be in the mix to help ease the electricity crisis May By John Seiler The Orange County Register With the lights and air conditioners set to go out in summer blackouts everyone is scrambling for more energy production Thats why nuclear power is back cleaner safer and more efficient President Bush set the tone in his page energy plan released Thursday calling nuclear power a major component of our national energy policy Th e president wants to make it easier to license new plants and give billi on in tax credits for purchasing nuclear plants to make it easier for industry consolidation And he wants to continue studying the construction of a nuclear waste site in Yucca Mountain Nevada a project that is crucial to California But California faces hurdles The state bans new nuclear construction until the national nuclearwaste site is built and anyone who builds here has to deal with legitimate concerns about earthquake safety and adequate water fo r cooling This state also is a major center for environmentalists who oppose nuclear power Nevertheless advances in technology years of experience and other factors should make nuclear energy a serious candidate for responding to Californias and the nations energy needs Its a good time to think through the history and the potential of this powerful energy producer Nuclear accidents The heyday of the American nuclear power program was the s through when the Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania led to an end to new plans for nuclear power The Three Mile Island accident destroyed the reactor but the core itself remained confined Radioactive gases were vented but there is no accepted evidence that this harmed the public writes John McCarthy a Stanford professor of computer sciences with an extensive Web site on nuclear power wwwformalstanfordedujmcprogressnuclearfaqhtml The last American nuclear plant opened in at Watts Barr in Tennessee years after its construction was given the OK No new plant construction ha s been approved in America since In the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Union now Ukraine exploded from highpressure steam not a nuclear explosion spewing out radiation and casting further doubts on the future of the American nuclear program although no American nuclear reactor ever had anything close to th e shoddy socialist design of the Chernobyl plant At the end of there were civilian power reactor years of experience throughout the world and Chernobyl is the only nuclear power plant accident harming the public McCarthy notes on his site Put another way excluding Chernobyl nuclear power plants have never harmed the public Irrational fears Contributing to the antinuclear atmosphere were such films as s The China Syndrome starring Jane Fonda and s Silkwood starring Meryl Streep And lets not forget one of the funnier skits on Saturday Night Live in in which Dan Aykroyd played President Jimmy Carter who becomes irradiated touring Two Mile Island after an accident and grows in to The Amazing Colossal President In California sentiment was set by thenGov Jerry Brown whose chief of staff was Gray Davis now Californias governor Well its not completely clear to me what a reasonably scientific position is on nuclear power except to say that where there are other potentially less destructive alternatives it doesnt make much sense to rush to increase dependency on nuclear power plants In California there are alternatives such as conservation cogeneration combined cycle geothermal and solar energy In the aggregate they make it possible to slow down the growing use of nuclear power Brown told biographer Orville Schell in Brown published in Foreign countries dont share Americas phobia about nuclear power which provides percent of Frances electricity compared to percent in the United States and percent in California America has operating reactors out of worldwide Surfin San Onofre Youd catch em surfin at San Onofre harmonized the Beach Boys in Surfin USA And the surfers still ride the waves right in front of the nuclear power plant which has been operated in complete safety since The first nuclear reactor built was decommissioned in and is being dismantled The two remaining newer reactors the large cones visible as you drive by on the I freeway are licensed to operate by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission until spokesman Ray Golden told me and could be running until if an extension is granted Put another way if the state had just three more nuclear sites the size of the one in San Onofre there would be no blackouts this summer The state i s expected to be short megawatts San Onofres two reactors together produce megawatts of power megawatts serves about million homes Californias only other nuclear plant is the Diablo Canyon facility which opened in and provides megawatts of power Last Wednesday I toured the San Onofre plant Bechtel workers were fixing o ne turbine on which an electrical circuit breaker had shorted out in February and caused a fire The turbine should be fixed by sometime in June in time for the summer energy crunch It should be noted that the turbine is not the reactor The turbine rotates and creates electricity the same as at any other kind of plant so the fire didnt come close to causing problems for the reactor The nuclear fuel the reactor uses costs about million a year Golden said That works out to a cost of less than cents a kilowatt hour he said but couldnt be more specific because of company policy That compare s to a cost of cents to cents a kilowatt hour for natural gas Regulatory hoops Despite the safety and need for nuclear power there are a number of hurdle s to building new plants especially in California lWaste disposal Currently all American nuclear plants store their nuclear wastes on site such as the large concrete bunkers I saw at San Onofre The waste has to be stored for years Theyre awaiting the potential development of the Yucca Mountain Nevada waste site on which billion already has been spent for studies by the US Department of Energy The si te already was the location of nuclear bomb tests The site will be ready at the earliest in years Barbara Byron nuclea r waste policy adviser for the California Energy Commission told me In the meantime California law stipulates that no nuclear fission thermal powerplant shall be permitted land use in the state until the US government develops a means for the disposal of highlevel nuclear waste Another problem is that President Carter shut down Americas only nuclear waste processing plant in the late s which would have recycled most of the waste immensely relieving the problem In March Sen Pete Domenici of New Mexico introduced S the Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assuran ce Act of which would develop a new waste reprocessing facility lEarthquakes The states unstable geology adds to the risk and cost of building plants here lWater The states lack of water makes it difficult to site new plants Byron said nuclear plants use two and a half times as much water as other plants lIn a deregulated market companies are less likely to pay the billion t o billion a new nuclear plant is estimated to cost Byron said How does that compare The Electric Power Supply Association told me that its difficult to estimate the cost of building and running a new plant whether it uses nuclear natural gas or some other power However the costs of som e recent natural gas plants have ranged from to per megawat t of installed power or as much as million for megawatts of power And given that new naturalgas plants range from to megawatts theres more flexibility in designing and financing projects New technologies But the technology keeps moving forward One thing that should keep costs down is standardized nuclearplant designs an idea that has kept prices reasonable in France In the past each nuclear plant in America was basically designed as a unique unit Since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which regulates all nuclear plants in America has approved three new advanced designs The Advanced Boiling Water Reactor design by GE Nuclear Energy which generates megawatts the System design by Westinghouse formerly ABBCombustion Engineering which generates megawatts and is similar to that used a t San Onofre and the AP design by Westinghouse which generates megawatts Nine other reactor designs have been submitted for NRC review however onl y two the AP and the Pebble Bed Module Reactor are being actively pursued at this time the NRC reports on its Web site wwwnrcgovOPAgmotipfsadvancedrxhtml The AP is a more powerful version of the AP But the Pebble Bed desi gn is new and is called politically correct by those working on it Andrew Kadak told me hes a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog y in the nuclear engineering department He said the new technology is highefficiency heliumcooled It runs at lower temperatures than traditional nuclear plants and uses a different type of fuel It produces less energy per cubic meter Essentially theres no chance for melting because of the lower power density they generate You could put them near population centers because of their safetyEach plant would generate about MW or about one tenth of current plants Construction planned for a plant in South Africa will run million Even if the cost were double i n America he said its still very competitive for natural gas The South African plant will produce power at a cost about cents to cents per kilowatthour about half what natural gas cost two years ago when natura l gas prices were stable the price comparison is even better today since natural gas prices have more than doubled Kadak said the concerns over emitting gasses into the environment the high cost of other fuels and a changing political climate make nukes feasible again Kadak said that the Pebble Bed design can be up and running within four yea rs once a site is approved When will we go nuclear again For the first time in a long time it looks like it might be starting up again Fred Smith told me about nuclear power construction hes head of t he Competitive Enterprise Institute a Washington thinktank that advances new thinking on economic matters Sooner or later we will have a waste facility he said of the Yucca Mountain site The nuclear option is far more viable than most people thought The antinuclear campaign has passed its peak But it will take time I think within the decade well have a new nuclear plant That wasnt true two years ago Moreover natural gas which will power most of the new plants coming onli ne in California will continue to be scarce We havent drilled for it Smith said Its hard to transmit Well have to build more pipelines It s not easy to ship from abroad By contrast nuclear powers fuel prices are almost constant Whats shortcircuiting the construction of nuclear power The same thing that has caused the electricity and other energy crises politics Even though nuclear plants would alleviate concerns real or imagined about global warming by reducing dependency on fossil fuels and coal environmentalists remain opposed including the Sierra Club and the Green Party The Sierra Club Web site includes several resolutions opposing nuclear powe r The Green Party platform called for the early retirement of nuclear power reactors as soon as possible in no more than years Legislation In the California Legislature Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino introduced Assembly Bill which would have allowed the construction of nuclear plants in California even without a national wastedisposal facilit y But it was amended only to allow a single nuclear plant owned by the state not a good idea It then was made a twoyear bill meaning it wont be considered until next January Sen Tom McClintock of Simi Valley has sponsored Senate Joint Resolution a nonbinding resolution that reads the Legislature hereby determine s that nuclear energy is a necessary source of electricity generation with n o detrimental impact on its citizens and environment and be it further resolved that the Legislature of the State of California urges the United States Secretary of Energy to expedite the review of the scientific data regarding Yucca Mountains suitability as a permanent federal repository fo r highlevel radioactive materials and make his recommendation to the preside nt this year This is the first step in the debate McClintock told me The second step will begin this summer when state and federal legislators hear from citizens calling them in the dark during blackouts That will concentrate minds on the necessity of bringing back to America an electrici ty source that is safe cheap and almost

business group urged Gov Gray Davis yesterday to take emergency steps in the energy crisis including seizing power plants an action the governor said may be in the cards Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego Building Owners and Managers Association overseers of about commercial properties here The meeting at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown was closed to the media In remarks to reporters later Davis repeated his hard line against outofstate energy producers relating a threat made to a dozen power executives in a private meeting May I told the generators face to face as close as I am to you Gentlemen you are going to lose your plants and Im going to sign a windfallprofits tax unless you help us get through this summer without blackouts and without staggering prices Davis also said he told them You know youve been ripping us off acting in a predatory manner If you do it this summer you leave me no choice but to take your plants and sign a windfallprofits tax So the ball is in your court gentlemen Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had a frank exchange with Davis We want to do our fair share on conservation but were also concerned about the supply side he said The group strongly urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary includin g seizing plants Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of conservation measures Yet some cannot be implemented without state intervention she said For example Davis urged that airconditioning thermostats be set at degrees but a lot of our leases dont permit it she said While in San Diego Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree fro m Scripps Research Institute Davis intensifies attacks on Texas firms By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy companies shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home state of President Bush We are literally in a war with energy companies who are pricegouging us Davis told reporters while responding to Bushs energy plan this week Man y of those companies are in Texas The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy companies in the Southwest Anyone could have purchased the California power plants Davis said but t he people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest However a state Energy Commission report shows that when California utilities sold more than power plants capable of producing megawatts Texas firms purchased plants producing about megawatts Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on itself So if Texas can have some kind of price relief Davis said I think California is entitled to price relief But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from offering to sell power for more than per megawatthour far above the average that California expects to pay for noncontracted power th is spring The campaign operation for Davis who is up for reelection next year and h as been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in distributed a news release yesterday saying that Davis is emerging as a national spokesman fo r the Democrats on energy issues The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic presidential candidate Al Gores campaign Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane a s interim communication consultants He named Gores former deputy chief of staff Nancy McFadden as senior adviser The governor will give the Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio addre ss today While Davis blames the Lone Star State none of Pacific Gas and Electrics power plants which produce megawatts was sold to Texas firms They were sold to Duke of North Carolina Mirant of Georgia and Calpine of California The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES Corp of Virginia which obtained megawatts Reliant a Texas firm bought plants from Edison that can produce megawatts Destec of Houston and NRG Energy of Minneapolis purchased two Edison plants with an output of megawatts Dynegy of Houston and NRG Energy purchas ed plants producing megawatts from San Diego Gas and Electric Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic transfer of wealth from California to Houston A large electricity marketin g firm with close ties to Bush Enron also is based in Houston But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant whose profits soare d last year Reliant openly rejected Davis call last week for generators to accept a percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California utilities Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to provide emergency power to California Davis began singling out Reliant aft er it charged the state per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by the California grid Reliants president Joe Bob Perkins said in a teleconference with California reporters yesterday that Reliant charged the high price because it did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limit ed number of days The state of California which has spent about billion buying power for utility customers since January made emergency purchases of megawatt hours from Reliant on May and paying per megawatt hour for a total of In Texas the Public Utilities Commission adopted a per megawatt hou r cap on bids to supply emergency power as a circuitbreaker in case prices somehow skyrocketed after Texas deregulates next year I realize that amount has been reached in California said Terry Hadley a spokesman for the Texas PUC Nothing close to that has been reached in Texas Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator wa s per megawatt hour in He said the average price is to per megawatt hour Texas has a surplus of power unlike California which has to import about percent of its power Texas also has a selfcontained power grid that cover s about percent of the state including Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin California is part of a sprawling Western power grid Davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the West The Texas PUC rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a failsafe saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power plants are needed The governor yesterday also appointed a new energy adviser Kellan Fluckige r who is on loan from the Independent System Operator which operates the California power grid Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation ASSOCIATED PRESS May LOS ANGELES The head of the California Public Utilities Commission pro vided a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduc ed electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices While testifying before the committee Friday PUC President Loretta Lynch displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last November According to the graphs after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates We certainly see a pattern Lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers Many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent California Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production Lynch said She would not identify the power plants involved however Lynch did say th at they are owned by at least two companies Sen Joseph Dunn who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said Lynchs testimony on its face is very damning He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior During a break in Fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of majo r power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits There has been no collusion said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy Producers Association The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin California economy braces for billion electric rate hike By Michael Liedtke ASSOCIATED PRESS May SAN FRANCISCO Higher power costs zapped restauranteur Marino Sandoval and his customers even before California regulators decided this week how to allocate a billion electricity rate hike the highest in the state s history Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill Sandova l last month raised the prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain El Balazo by as much as percent on some items A giant burrito that cost at the end of March costs Saturday We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything from our beans to our tortillas was going up almost every day Our higher prices ha ve everything to do with the higher energy prices said Sandoval who runs si x restaurants in San Francisco and the East Bay From hotels to bagel shops businesses throughout California have been raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power costs Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the states power crisis Now businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the states two bigges t utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co The higher rates which will begin appearing in Junes utility bills threaten to jolt the states already jittery economy Pretty soon we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession said Dave Puglia a vice president for APCO a public affairs firm hired by California business interests to study the economic effect of the states energy woes Until now California businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the states staggering electricity bill which is on a pace to reach billio n this year about times more than in By itself the billion rate increase approved by the California Public Utilities Commission probably isnt enough to topple the states roughly trillion economy the sixth largest in the world It will cause some hardships particularly for some small business owners but from the macro point of view these rate increases arent going to have a major impact on Californias output predicted Sung Won Sohn chief economist for Wells Fargo Co which runs the biggest bank headquartered in the state But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline natural gas health care benefits and workers compensation insurance Against this backdrop many employers also face pressure to raise their workers wages to help pay for Californias high housing costs If this keeps up at some point we are going to reach a breaking point in the economy said Allan Zaremberg president of the California Chamber of Commerce The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and Economic Stability a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricit y rate increase from businesses to households Under the plan approved by the PUC businesses are expected to pay about billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional billion Even if they are spared on their utility bills consumers still will be pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along their electricity price increases Some California firms particularly those making commodities sold around th e world wont be able to substantially raise their prices without losing business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and countries Manufacturers of cement glass paper products and steel are among the companies that probably wont be able to pass along their higher energy costs Puglia said The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about percent to percent of a big manufacturers budget Puglia estimated up from about percent now I wouldnt be surprised if we see some companies go out of business becaus e of this said Justin Bradley director of energy programs for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Association a hightech trade group Even if they dont shut down completely many companies likely will lay off workers as they cut costs to pay for power The California Manufacturers an d Technology Association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the loss of jobs or about more than the entire dotcom indu stry has laid off nationwide during the past months Painful though they may be higher electricity rates and some resulting layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts tha t probably would have occurred if retail prices hadnt been raised according to most economists People are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the Californ ia economy said Stephen Levy director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy a Palo Alto research firm The rate increases are part of a longterm solution for California We needed them to stabilize th e market On balance this is a good thing Even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from last year to this year El Balazos Sandoval shares Levys optimism After all customers continue to pour into his restaurants despi te his restaurants higher menu prices Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am going to have to raise my prices again he said If I have to I will I dont think people are going to stop eating because of this Price information sought from natural gas companies By H Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS May WASHINGTON A federal regulatory agency late Friday directed natural ga s companies selling in California to provide detailed information for better investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it viewed the unusually high prices of wholesale natural gas in California as a matter of serious concern but didnt have enough information to determine if they are illega l It noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the California borde r has been exceedingly high since December when it ranged between and per thousand cubic feet compared to to elsewhere in the count y The most recent prices at the California border exceed more than twice the wholesale price in other parts of the country Such a disparity over su ch a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market the agency said California officials have argued for months that FERC should intervene and more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices which have been a major cause of some of the runup in electricity costs in the state Many o f the states power plants run on natural gas The order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar quarter including volumes of gas sold prices transportation rates daily operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state Allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the cente r of a hearing by a FERC administrative law judge all this week The hearing will continue next week The case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the Houstonbased E l Paso Corp which supplies Southern California California regulators and two of the states financially troubled utilities filed a formal complaint with FERC alleging that manipulation by two El Pa so subsidiaries one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipel ine led to billion in natural gas overcharges since March El Paso Corp has strongly denied the allegation For the past week attorneys for El Paso have questioned witnesses from the California Public Utilities Commission in an attempt to disprove the charge s The witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that could have affected prices in their analyses but they did not back away fr om their conclusion In support of their argument California officials have provided internal E l Paso memos which have not been disclosed publicly that allegedly discuss market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner has said the documents contain statements that could lead one to believe there was an abuse of pipeline capacity He is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this summer A final decision on what action to take if any would be up to the full commission Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan Power He also hires highprofile consultants in effort to boost his political standing By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z BARABAK Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic Partys point man against President Bushs energy plan even as he seeks to bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed their crisismanagement skills during the scandalridden Clinton administration Davis was expected to again criticize Bushs energy plan today as he makes the official Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio address In the last week Davis has variously blasted the presidents energy plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show on CNN and in an opinion piece for the Washington Post In an interview with Associated Pres s Davis vowed to hold everyone accountable myself the energy producers and the president of the United States We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging us Davis said Friday Many of those companies are in Texas Mr Presiden t you didnt create this problem but you are the only one who can solve it At the same time Davis all but acknowledged his own political problem s when he announced that he has retained two political aides Mark Fabiani an d Chris Lehane The two who also do work for Southern California Edison wil l be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of per monthmore than the earned by the governor himself Lehane known for his tarttongued commentary was Vice President Al Gores main campaign spokesman and had a knack for getting under Bushs sk in during the campaign Fabiani a Harvard law school graduate became a highly partisan and acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky affair Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the e nd of the late mayors tenure In political circles the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaste r Davis decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governors oncesterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent criticism over his handling of the energy crisis Their arrival also corresponds to Davis increasingly aggressive stand on the energy crisis In recent days Davis for the first time has attacked an individual generator Reliant Energy of Houston for charging a record per megawatt for electricity on two days last week He also dared President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to stand up to their friends in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices charged in California Davis more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up the ir attacks on the president using the energy plan to launch a broader assault on Bushs leadership and policies One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no shortterm relief for consumers said Dan Pfeiffer a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Assn which Davis chairs And there is no better example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in California In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of Californiat he nations largest electoral prizeDemocrats see Bushs energy response as a way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interes ts This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration an d a party that is bought and paid for by special interests said Jenny Backu s a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee To press the case the party has created a snide Web sitewwwgrandoldpetroleumand will soon start running TV ads attacking G OP lawmakers over the energy issue including in California Paul Maslin the governors pollster said Davis had given the preside nt a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would addres s the energy problem But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it became clear we werent going to get any help from Washington For his part Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania part of his tour to sell t he administrations energy blueprint The president praised Californians for doing a fantastic job in conservation And yet theyre lacking energy Theyre having blackouts Bush said We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great sta te of California But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence While Bush did not mention the governor the presidents deputies have rushed to criticize him Virginia Gov James Gilmore head of the Republican National Committee suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when the president is the one who came forward with the first energy plan weve seen in years Hes going to have to answer the question of what hes done as governor Gilmore said While hes in the process of attacking one might suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record On Thursday Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party official Darrell Kearney Hes had plenty of time to do something and he hasnt done anything she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada Iowa where Bush had just finished speaking Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush plan namely the focus on longterm solutions at a time voters are growing increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills While the administration talks about how we approach things in the next five years theres not a lot of empathy or understanding for whats affecting people now said Stuart Rothenberg a nonpartisan political analyst in Washington Maybe its unfair to talk about Bush and Cheneys oil backgrounds and Texas backgrounds Rothenberg said But its an obvious thing for critics to do Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of Congress next year if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans really become concerned It puts the burden on the White House and Republicans to change that Davis new aides while considered expert in solving the kind of political crisis threatening Davis pose the potential of controversy on their own As consultants Lehane and Fabiani unlike government officials are n ot required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings a nd sources of income However in an interview on Friday Lehane acknowledged that he and Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern California Edison He insisted there is no conflict Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck wi th Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy Several lawmakers oppose the deal contending that it is too rich for Edison Both sides Edison and Davis are in agreement on what needs to be do ne here Lehane said As the governor said we are literally in a war with these outofstate generators Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications issues for Davis Harry Snyder of Consumers Union a critic of the DavisEdison deal blasted Davis decision to hire consultants who also wor k for the utility Davis has done everything politically wrong Snyder said He hasnt done anything that is consistent with the democratic process It is the wor st abuse of power that I have seen in years of lobbying Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo aboard Mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of communication strategy Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick said He has tremendous experience He takes the incoming You get hit wit h something in the morning He knows how to turn it around by the afternoon Lehane said the governors decision to hire them does not suggest Davi s will become more pugnacious although he added that Davis is not someone afraid to pick a fight when someone like the outofstate generators represent policies that are bad for the people of California Gov Davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time i n this state Lehane said He has a keen understanding of how this state works and how politics in this state works I dont think his style is goin g to change or be any different than he has been throughout his career Copyright Los Angeles Times PUC Allegations Detailed Hearing The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance records show no valid reason for generators to cut power production By ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee PUC President Loretta Lynch said the companies behavior helped drain so much electricity from the states grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alert s Lynchs testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that sta te investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down unnecessarily to create artificial shortages often when the state was mo st desperate for electricity During her testimony Friday Lynch went beyond her assertions about unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly throttling back generation The PUC and state Atty Gen Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating th e exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to manipulate wholesale electricity prices including unnecessarily shutting down their plants or reducing supply The facilities theysay are aging an d have run so hard during the states crisis that they often require extensiv e maintenance But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions surrounding the generators activities Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last November After the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the graphs show the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies because electricity reserves had fallen seriously low The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices With that the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates We certainly see a pattern Lynch told the committee which isinvestigating alleged manipulation of the states wholesale power market by energy suppliers Many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent California Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production Lynch said She declin ed to identify the power plants involved saying only that they are owned by a t least two companies Sen Joseph Dunn DSanta Ana who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said Lynchs information on its face is very damning He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior We are looking at data that is suspicious Dunn said During a break in Fridays hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of major power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits There has been no collusion said Jean MuFoz of the Independent En ergy Producers Assn She said many of the plants bought by outofstate generators under Californias flawed deregulation plan are more than years old The plant s have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch she said MuFoz told reporters that the plants owned by outofstate companies last year produced more electricity than the previous year Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney generals office Atlantabased Mirant Corp said inspectors have visited company plants more than times this year and have found no wrongdoing Mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the crisis the company said in a statement Friday But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than plants by PUC investigators since December show that generators are not always producing all the power they can It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past halfyear where generation units were not producing the amount of electrici ty that they were capable of producing Lynch said Copyright Los Angeles Times Utility Exec Rejects the Governors Criticism Power Leader of Reliant Energy defends policies and says Davis rhetoric could harm California By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOThe top executive of a Houstonbased energy company single d out for criticism this week by Gov Gray Davis defended his company Friday and warned that the governors rhetoric will ultimately hurt California On Wednesday we were called obstructionist said Joe Bob Perkins chief executive of Reliant Energy which bought five Southern California power plants when the state launched deregulation in I dont think its obstructionist to supply record amounts of power from old plants in order to keep the lights on Perkins said I dont thi nk its obstructionist to invest more than million in alone to upgrad e the plants and reduce emission levels I dont think its obstructionist to continue to run our facilities at times when theres been no guarantee of payment In a telephone conference call with reporters Perkins said Californ ia officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the impacts of summer blackouts Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures coul d scare off substantial business from California For months Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in California as gougers and profiteers but until last week he did not single out individual companies Last Thursday after state power buyers paid an extraordinary p er megawatthour Davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state power purchases and named Reliant as the seller Reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the sta te and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the million it is owe d by California utilities Theyre one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said after the Reliant executives remarks The governors recent attack has made some Reliant officials wonder if he is building a case to seize control of its power plants Davis has threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs Perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the state from buying the power which was produced at a small inefficient pla nt near Santa Barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of ai r pollution regulations Reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later this summer Maviglio said Reliants argument defies logic When you make a bid you want somebody to buy the power Copyright Los Angeles Times PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion Power She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create artificial shortages An industry spokesman calls the accusation idiocy By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ Times Staff Writers State investigators have uncovered evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency working with the state attorney generals office is probing patterns of plant outages that have created artificial shortages particularly when the state has issued emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said in an interview at The Times And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce even when they were obligated to do so unde r special contracts with the state and utility companies Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough information for the PUC and attorney generals office to take legal action against the generators next month The exact nature of that action she sai d is still under review Lynch who is an attorney did not name specific suppliers or provide documentation of her assertions She said that information will remain confidential until court proceedings are undertaken Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark et in any unlawful way including orchestrating plant shutdowns They say the facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha t breakdowns are a recurring problem Lynch and Gov Gray Davis who has been particularly critical of outofstate generators have not suggested that every plant shutdown has been unwarranted In fact the governors top advisor on power plants released a stateme nt last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was justified and that the companys officials were accommodating State Atty Gen Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi nt investigation with the PUC A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyers office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wideranging probe of possible civil and criminal violations So far the attorney generals office has subpoenaed documents in categories from generators including records of plant operations pricing practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another about Californias power market Were looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair business practice laws Lockyer has told The Times Although he has not provided details of his offices findings he recently said the inquiry is beginning to get interesting Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass ed during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous subpoenaed records obtained after intense legal battles with the power companies In addition investigators have been entering plants where unplanned shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records Lync h said At times the investigators have been denied access and have had to exert legal pressure to get in she said The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices whic h have gone from a megawatthour in December to as high as last week I would argue its no accident Lynch said of the high prices That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the rules of Californias flawed deregulation program which allowed them to bu y power plants formerly run by the states three largest utilities Gary Ackerman a spokesman for a trade association of large power producers said Lynchs allegations were the height of idiocy The reason many plants have been down in recent months he said is th at power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe r demand He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman executive director of the Weste rn Power Trading Forum State analysts have argued however that power traders can reap extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power that is sold are so high According to Lynch investigators have found that some companies were more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat e the states power market She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern When operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage alertmeaning th at electricity reserves have dropped below plants that do not need repairs suddenly are yanked offline That she said aggravates the shortages and the cost of wholesale electricity soars Before December state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up prices primarily through bidding At the time the market was designed to p ay all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the states grid operato r That changed in December when new federal regulations restructured Californias wholesale power market to loosen price controls Lynch said Since then a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emergednot coincidental ly in my view she said Now she added the state has endured historically high levels of unplanned plant outages The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by utility companies because they have not been going off line at record levels Lynch said The California Energy Commission reported last week that the states electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several times higher than in the last two years A Times analysis of state data found that throughout the last two months about megawatts of production was offline more than a third of the peak power used in California on a typical day That has been about evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns By contrast shutdowns in the same period of and took only to megawatts offline Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electrici ty supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise prices The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any wrongdoing However FERC released a study in February of closures at three other California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcit y of power After talking to plant operators by telephone reviewing documents and visiting the three plants federal inspectors concluded that the companies appeared to have taken whatever steps were

this story Copyright Los Angeles Times Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark Effect Presidents energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the powerdeprived Golden State By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS Times Staff Writers California lawmakers analysts and others waistdeep in the states power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House energy plan By the time many of President Bushs proposals kick in it will be too late to do the Golden State much good This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the next critical months groused state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey You cant focus just on the long term here Because the patient will be de ad before we get the lifesupport systems in place Gov Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are draining Californias treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases Instead the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil increased reliance on nuclea r power and more than billion in tax credits for conservation and energy development Most of Bushs proposals however are slowacting remedies and many others already are being applied in California which was hit by energy woe s far ahead of other states The plans dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices experts say Overall the message in this plan is Drop dead California said Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased research and advocacy group I dont think it delivers another megawatt to California added Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the power crisis as an ongoing emergency rather than a temporary one Californias supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer once new power plants of them licensed in the pipelinestart churning Its not that we dont have longterm problems said Stephen Levy director of the Palo Altobased Center for Continuing Study of the Californ ia Economy Its just that energy isnt among them Others including many environmentalists say Bush could have made a noticeable impact by for example beefing up energy efficiency programsa quick clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand Why not provide aggressive incentives rebates to get people to purchase more efficient air conditioners asked Dan Reicher assistant Energy secretary in the Clinton administration Over the course of the yea r a program like that can make a dramatic difference because air conditionin g consumes nearly onethird of Californias peak energy supply Instead Reicher noted Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency standards for air conditioners a move that critics say will require the country to build new power plants Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California were clouded by doubt Bush for example directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to relieve a key transmission bottleneck known as Path between Northern and Southern California But he specified that the upgrade which requires building a mile line at an estimated cost of million be funded by nonfederal contributionsmeaning the financially strapped utilities migh t be expected to bear the cost Gov Davis who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from Washington said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an d criticized the president for allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of which reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said the state is doing everything possible to build and conser ve our way out of the problem but it desperately needs federal price control s on energy costs In California energy users spent about billion this year even with consumption down the bill could top billion But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney who led the task force that prepared the plan are opposed to price caps preferring to let market forc es reign Davis said that laissez faire approach puts Californias economy in peril Just saying over the long haul everything will work out is turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state Davis said Small businesses literally will go out of business because the y cant afford these rates Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California Bush recommends building power plants over the next yearsabout eight plants a month But California is already on a plantbuilding spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year s The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi ng for a renewed commitment to nuclear power The California governor however has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive order issued in February There is little evidence meanwhile that Californians are eager to approve an expansion in nuclear power Nationwide not one new nuclear plan t has been licensed in more than years And a Times Poll in February found that of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state You can barely build cleanburning gas plants here let alone nuclear plants said Edward Kahn a San Franciscobased energy consultant with Analysis GroupEconomics Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines Currently the US governments power to forcibly acquire private property applies only to highways and gas pipelines Expanding that power is likely to enrage property owners and propertyrights advocates who typically expect backing from Bushstyle conservatives Im just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the states authority over its own land said Lynch of the PUC The issue is already heated in California Communities in southwestern Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas Electrics attemp ts to use eminent domain to obtain private land for miles of transmission lines The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energ

connected to state grid LA not among them say their customers should not be deprived to aid others By SCOTT GOLD Times Staff Writer A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the federal government today to exempt them from blackouts Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in California and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled outjust as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages Most Californians pay large investorowned utilities like Southern California Edison Co for power But about a quarter of households from th e tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital are billed for electricit y by cities counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit utilities There are municipal utilities Four of themserving Los Angeles Burbank Glendale and the Imperial Valley east of San Diegoare independent of the state power grid and do n ot face any outages But the others are required by contract to give electrici ty back to the California Independent System Operator which runs the grid by participating in rolling blackoutsalthough they have plenty of power to serve their customers It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs said California Municipal Utilities Assn attorney Tony Braun These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions behind the deregulation of Californias electricity market and the power shortage We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and that we dont have the rightnor does anyone elseto take it away from th em when they need it said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans Our customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t o Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts Vernons public utility has customers all but of which are industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants T he city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state said Jorge Somoano Vernons assistant director of resource management FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the campaign Up to half including Riverside are expected to either file thei r own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon said Washington attorne y Bonnie Blair who represents municipal utilities in Azusa Banning and Colt on Even the campaigns supporters are unsure whether it will succeed Bla ir acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal challenge to FERC which is expected to decide on the issue by midJune An d she said municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don e enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis Some cities with municipal utilities such as Anaheim are not plannin g to join the campaign Marcie Edwards general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities said the relationships between municipal utilities and CalISO are too complicated t o make a clean break She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed entirely on the large investorowned utilitiesincluding this summers energy crunch And until that can be proved she said municipal utilities still have an obligation to support Californias power grid Its not right to go either way she said The fact remains th at municipals still have an obligation to serve Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through agreements with CalISO that call for them to share electricity in an emergency Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for natural disasters such as earthquakes or other sudden and monumental problems such as a plane running into a transmission line The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient supplies Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC does not constitute an emergency The obligation to share in rolling blackouts did not contemplate situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to provide resources to serve their customers Blair said If they are force d to participate in rolling blackouts the effect is that the ISO is taking energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it Jim Detmers CalISOs vice president of operations said the organization plans to fight the campaign He said emergency provisions of CalISOs agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy crunch Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha ve their own electricity distribution He compared the exemption request to a homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbors because he wants to kee p his water for himself What were dealing with is an overall shortage Detmers said We wa nt to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyones lives are at risk Ronald Nunnally Edisons director of federal regulations and contract s said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the power grid to which they are connected The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole if you will under all circumstances he said Blair said those arguments dont hold up Indeed she said the municip al utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits giving public property such as electricity bought by a municipal utility to a private enterprise such as investorowned electric companies Our customers are paying for it she said Thats the bottom line A United Defense The big bad wolf of Californias electric power crisis is the private power generators accused of manipulating the market to drive wholesale pow er rates into the stratosphere out of pure greed Their pricing is insane but only the federal government can fix wholesale prices The Bush administrati on refuses to do that leaving the state virtually helpless to deal with what many are now calling an energy cartel Gradually however the state is arming itself in other ways to do battle with the big power bullies who appear more and more to have acted i n concert to affect prices Not as blatantly as the oil producers cartel OPEC but with even more dramatic results What is California considering A new state power agency could build and run its own plants Lawmakers might as they are threatening impose a windfall profits tax The state could join with other Pacific states in a buyers cartel th at would simply refuse to purchase power if the price got too high The idea seems a bit desperate but it has a Star Wars allure to it and just might work The focus is on six big private companies They produce only about onefourth of the states electricity but they are the ones that have powe r available when it is needed the most as the heat rises air conditioners g o on and blackouts are threatened The private and municipal utilities naturally use their own power first then turn to the outside generators to meet additional demand The state has forked over billion to keep the lights on since the biggest private utilities went broke The cost of power has hit an obscene peak of nearly a megawatthour charged by Reliant Energy of Houston during a recent hot spell This price more than times the going rate a year ago prompted a furious Gov Gray Davis to threaten to use his emergen cy powers to commandeer Reliants power or even seize one of its power plants No one is eager for the state to take over private power plants That smacks of dictatorship But if the generators can get away with charging so much during a brief hot spell in May what will the cost be in August The state is continues to investigate allegations that the six produce rs colluded to control the market or that they shut down plants to create a false shortage The state may take legal action next month However even that may not force prices down The buyers cartel has possibilities California would get Oregon and Washington to join in deciding the highest rate they are willing to pay for power this summer a price still providing the producers a generous profit If the generators wouldnt sell at that level the states would refuse to buy This would mean more blackouts for a time but the generators would be left with power they could not sell This extreme action would not be necessary of course if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted its responsibility under federal law and imposed a reasonable temporary cap on wholesale power prices That is n ot likely If the states are left to their own devices they can at least join forces Then for a change let the seller beware Search the archives of the Los Angeles Times for similar stories You will not be charged to look for stories only to retrieve one Cheney blames Davis for crisis They knew over a year ago they had a problem Zachary Coile Chronicle Political Writer Monday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Vice President Dick Cheney in his most blunt and partisan assessment yet of Californias energy crisis faulted Democratic Gov Gray Davis for failing to act quickly enough and called the states purchase of nearly billion worth of energy a harebrained scheme Cheney the administrations point man on energy issues went on a pair of Sunday morning news shows to help sell a national energy plan that Presiden t Bush proposed last week The discussion inevitably turned to California Theyve bankrupted the biggest utility in the state destroyed the states credit rating and squandered a significant portion of the states financial surplus in a harebrained scheme to try to use the state to purchase power the vice president told Tim Russert of NBCs Meet the Press A spokesman for Davis responded that the vice presidents remarks yesterday were grossly misinformed and meant to divert attention from the administrations neglect of the state and its power woes The Bush administration has refused to address Californias problem and n ow theyre washing their hands of it Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said The titfortat remarks culminated a week that has seen an escalation in th e war of words between the Democratic governor and the Republican White House The two administrations are increasingly engaging in a blame game as they confront a worsening crisis with enormous political stakes for both sides Responding to critics including Davis who say the White House has don e little to help California the vice president pointed the finger back at th e states top Democratic official They knew over a year ago they had a problem and Gray Davis refused to address that problem Cheney said They kept putting it off and putting it off and putting it off with the notion that somehow price caps could be maintained Now today where are they in California Well rates are having to go up The PUC just had to increase the rates themselves in California Theyve go t rolling blackouts theyve had some already Theyll have them across the state this summer Cheney said Cheneys remarks referred to the states purchases of almost billion wor th of energy which began after the major utilities could no longer afford skyrocketing wholesale prices for energy Earlier this month the Democratcontrolled California Legislature approved a bill opposed by GOP lawmakers to issue billion in bonds to repay th e states general fund to avoid making deep cuts in other state programs KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON Thats the governor keeping the lights on Maviglio said Because of the failure of the federal government to act to impose price controls the state had to move to keep the lights on Cheneys comments came just days after Davis sharply criticized Bushs ener gy plan saying it wouldnt help California consumers facing rising energy bills Mr President you didnt create this problem but you are the only one wh o can solve it Davis said in a letter released to the press With all due respect Californians want to know Mr President whether youre going to be on their side Davis also suggested that by refusing to ask federal regulators for price caps Bush was effectively allowing pricegouging by oil and gas producers in his home state of Texas Cheney dismissed the allegation last week as goofy CALIFORNIA A BAD EXAMPLE In speeches on his energy plan the president has mostly used California as an example to the nation of what not to do He warned last week that the states blackouts were a preview of what other states could face if the country doesnt boost energy supplies Some California Republican leaders have warned Bush who will visit Souther n California later this month to soften the administrations rhetoric on the energy crisis to avoid being seen as unsympathetic to the states plight Cheney explained yesterday that the administration opposes even shortterm price controls because they could discourage energy suppliers from selling energy into California and building more plants in the state In the final analysis its going to be the private sectors response that generates the power were going to need longterm Cheney said The vice president did offer an olive branch to Davis noting that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers approved the states deregulation legislation precipitating the states energy problems In fairness to Governor Davis the screwy regulatory scheme they put in place was supported on both sides of the aisle out there Cheney said Bu t he was the one who was in charge when it went haywire Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif who followed Cheney on CBS Face the Nation yesterday morning put the blame back on the White House She recalled that President John F Kennedy called steel company executives into his office when they were accused of price gouging She urged Bush and Cheney to do th e same with energy suppliers You have the vice president sitting there sounding like an oil man Boxe r said The energy companies are blameless here he says And the truth is that the

equivalent of numerous nuclear power plants since the last Were running out of energy freakouts of the s The next time your smug friends and relatives back east mock California as an energy hog you can inform them that in fact we only use half as much electricity per capita as the rest of the United States A major reason prescient energyconservation rules developed under thenGov Jerry Brown t wo decades ago according to veteran energyconservation scientist Art Rosenfeld Widely ridiculed as Governor Moonbeam Brown and the California Energy Commission thought it was wiser to develop tough energyconservation standards for buildings and appliances than to build new nuclear power plan ts and it turns out it was says Rosenfeld a current member of the Energ y Commission and former czar of energy conservation science at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which is funded mainly by the US Energy Department Undaunted by the changing political winds of the past three decades scientists at the lab have continued designing energyconserving technologies even though at first glance the new technologies dont look that exciting NEW LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES Witness for example the lamps being tested at the post office in Rodeo T he lamps are long thin tubes that aim light directly onto each carriers mailsorting station rather than wastefully spreading it all over the plac e Its a simple innovation yet it reduces energy costs for lighting by up to percent Lawrence Berkeley researchers have calculated Likewise they have recently invented a new type of highperformance energyefficient table lamp that could greatly reduce the current power problems we have in California while increasing the quality of the lighting says researcher Michael Siminovitch of the Berkeley lab The lamp consists of compact fluorescent lights that can be manipulated to direct light in different directions toward the ceiling for example Th at allows the users to finetune lighting conditions to their precise needs overcoming common complaints about the dimness and poor design of first generation powersaving lights The new lamps use only onefourth as much energy as a watt incandescent table lamp or a watt halogen lamp Unveiled in March they are being field tested by the lab in collaboration with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric LIGHTEMITTING DIODES Looking farther into the future the oldfashioned incandescent light bulb may be challenged by electronic LEDs or lightemitting diodes commonly us ed for VCRs and alarm clocks Those dim little lights may eventually be made bright enough and white enough to begin replacing traditional lighting sources One problem the refraction or bending of light Everyone has seen what happens when one inserts a straw into a glass of water the submerged portion of the straw appears to bend In the semiconductor materials used i n LEDs much of the internally generated light is bent so much that it reflec ts back into the LED that is it cant escape Hence present LEDs dont em it enough light to attract a large commercial market However engineers at Lawrence Berkeley and elsewhere are designing new LED s that would emit far more light One of them is physicist Steve Johnson who is confident that LEDs can eventually be made brighter than ordinary light bulbs He points out that colored LEDs are already used in some traffic lights By mixing together LEDs that emit different wavelengths of light one could create a white lightemitting LED Johnson says White light is a mixture of all other optical wavelengths Johnson maintains LEDs could make a difference to the energy bill Onethird of our energy used in commercial buildings goes into lighting those buildings So anything we do to reduce the lighting bill is going to help the energy crisis SUPEREFFICIENT APPLIANCES All sorts of strategies are being tried in labs all over the country Forget to turn off the iron

methods to replace the compressed gases deployed by typical refrigerators Physicists have long known that some materials get hotter when magnetized and cool off when demagnetized Even todays refrigerators consume energy far more efficiently than they on ce did Federal energy standards for refrigerators that took effect in July require that they burn only onefourth as much energy as did their predecessors years ago Rosenfeld notes Even better he adds modern refrigerators are bigger and dont use chlorofluorocarbons chemical compounds that are believed to damage the ozo ne layer which

Janine DeFao Chronicle Staff Writer Monday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Oakland Already seeing red over rising utility bills Oakland residents have found themselves mired in red tape when they have sought energy alternatives such as solar power It can take up to eight weeks and cost more than to get the required city permits to install solar panels But the City Council is expected to change that tomorrow when it considers an emergency ordinance proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown to eliminate design review requirements for renewable energy installations including solar pane ls and wind devices Energy is an issue on everybodys plate these days We want to make it easy for people to get their permits and get their panels said Gary Patto n the citys deputy planning director Oakland officials said they know of no other city taking similar steps to promote alternative energy generation although cities throughout the Bay Area and the state are increasingly looking to renewable energy sources San Francisco for instance is considering placing solar energy bonds on t he November ballot that would fund installation of solar panels on municipal property and could provide lowcost loans for homeowners and businesses to do the same Berkeley also is working on a loan program for renewable energy sources for residences The Oakland measure which would remain in effect for two years also would apply to businesses interested in pursuing alternative energy generation As Californians already hit by the states energy crunch face the prospect of more rolling blackouts this summer Oakland city officials are receiving a growing number of inquiries from residents interested in installing solar panels Patton said The city also has heard complaints about the cost and time it now takes to get systems approved Gary Gerber president of Sun Light Power in Berkeley said he complained when he learned that it would cost more than to install a solar syst em on a home in the Montclair area The project is on hold awaiting the new ordinance The process didnt really fit our situation Its pretty cumbersome and is the same type of process you might go through for a major remodel Gerber said City officials responded beautifully in drafting a solarfriendly polic y he added Calvin Wong director of building services said the city has received a dozen applications for solar panel installations in the last month up fr om only a few applications before the energy crisis hit We anticipate a lot more he said Gerber said he gets five to calls a day from interested customers He ha s done as much business in the first three months of this year as he did all of last year he said I dont think solar panels have been a significant issue for Oakland up to now said Councilman Dick Spees who backs the proposed change We want t o encourage it by making it simple direct and less costly Oakland also is exploring installing solar panels on city buildings A household solar unit which can heat water or produce electricity directly can cost to although state rebates can reduce the price by half President Bushs energy plan released last week propos es a percent tax credit for residents who install solar panels Patton said the main target of Oaklands emergency ordinance was solar panels but it would apply to other renewable energy production facilities including those using wind and water Currently design review for such installations can cost between and and take between three and eight weeks depending on a propertys location Under the proposal design review would be waived once an owner submits drawings to the city showing that the equipment installation meets certain requirements such as matching the pitch of a sloped roof or if freestanding being no taller than feet For certain structures such as designated landmark sites design review still would be required but at no cost and lasting no more than five days Building permits and inspections costing between and still would be required to make sure the additions are safe Patton said Brown has long been considered an alternative energy

headquarters of the Independent System Operator monitorinchief of Californias energy grid they have a new job responding to more than detailed subpoenas The data the ISO keeps on electricity transactions are central to the half dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various parts of the states energy mess including possible criminal activity by power generators Theyre asking for everything and then some a spokeswoman for the ISO Stephanie McCorkle said sighing The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state Public Utilities Commission the Assembly the Senate the state attorney general and a phalanx of state and federal auditors all are boring into Californias ener gy mess The main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the electronstarved state Although most investigators say the ISOs logs and bid records show the various generators used their market share to drive up prices the issue is whether they did so acting collaboratively either directly or indirectly Generators deny any manipulation of the market They say their prices simpl y reflect a lack of supply plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas But that hasnt stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong Attorney General Bill Lockyer has been probing the actions of the generator s since August to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair business practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior We all feel weve been taken advantage of been gouged Lockyer said Th e question is whether its legal greed or illegal greed Theres no question its greed Lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like Reliant Energy Inc and Dynegy which have refused to disclose internal company information that Lockyer subpoenaed Feb The power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents Lockyer wants will be kept confidential Lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this summer The PUC also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices On Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said investigators found patterns of plant shutdowns that created artificial shortages Lockyer insisted that no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or criminal suit But were probably further along than any other investigativ e effort Generators say they are cooperating with the investigations except for worries about proprietary information becoming public and flatly reject the notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert We naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations sai d Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston It doesnt compute because we all compete against each other We dont cooperate shar e information or anything of that nature Its not only illegal but unethical to do so Said Chuck Griffin a Mirant Corp spokesman Any patterns would exist because of the rules they established long before Mirant was in California A new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market It too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over documents they consider confidential Discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing and right now were at an impasse said Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committees chairman Dunns committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws if it uncovers some kind of anticompetitive activity not already covered b y the law So far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the only entity to impo se any economic pain on generators After a probe of Californias power market last summer the commission issu ed an order in December that created a mechanism by which generators would hav e to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission In March the commission said generators had to justify million in charges or reimburse the money It also reached an million settlement with AES Southland and Williams Energy Marketing Trading over power plants that were supposed to be runni ng but werent Critics from Gov Gray Davis down say that generators owe many millions more in refunds Several other investigations are either under way or completed The PUC is investigating whether the holding companies of Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy in San Diego violate d

insinuating that Bushs close ties to the oil industry are behind his unwillingness to regulate prices Davis in delivering the Democratic response to Bushs weekly radio address called on Bush to place a cap on wholesale energy prices which he said a re imperiling Californias economy I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal governments exclusive responsibility to ensure energy prices a re reasonable said Davis California consumer advocates and utility officials alike endorsed the call for rate caps Bush has rejected such caps although in his radio address yesterday he noted that the average family energy bill has climbed by percent over th e past three years Thats a hardship for every family he said We need to act to protect family budgets His prescription however was not for restricting how much energy producer s can charge but for increasing energy production by building more power plants and drilling for oil in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Yesterday Bush put into action by executive order two of his recommendations including ordering federal agencies to speed permit approvals for new plant and pipeline construction Still other proposals such as tax credits for hybrid vehicle purchases will require congressiona l action Its time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new consensus Bush said in the radio address With new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment Last spring Davis said California was paying an average of for a megawatt of power By last week the price had spiked to nearly per megawatt Whats going on here pure and simple is unconscionable pricegouging by the big energy producers most of them incidentally located in Texas he said Davis criticized Bushs argument that limiting energy prices will deter producers from increasing the supply of energy Thats as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies a gallon to motivate them to produce milk he said Pacific Gas and Electric Co officials said they are pleased with Bushs emphasis on increasing electricity and natural gas generation and his call for improving energy efficiency But a prepared statement by PGE went on We continue to believe that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must stabilize the Western market thi s summer through circuit breakers price caps or costbased rates Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network a San Francisco based consumer advocacy group said Davis must realize Bush is not going to implement price caps In the absence of federal action the governor needs to take action himself said Spatt He could take plants by the power of eminent domain impose an excessprofits tax on energy producers or start a buyers carte l where Western states get together and refuse to pay over a certain price fo r electricity Davis should take his own advice to the

they intend to begin airing television advertising in California beginning tomorrow that accuses Bush a nd Republican lawmakers of failing to combat the rising cost of energy It is unusual for a campaign committee such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to air political advertising more than months before elections But the move was clearly intended to exploit consumer anger

Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of May to September when electricity usage normally grows by a third Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission sai d last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns And the California Independent System Operator which manages th e states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only wer e generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition We suspected it said Jim MacIntosh the manager of grid operations for t he ISO It was a sure factor in driving up prices Such swings in unit outpu t he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something Otherwise why would they do that Theyre tearing their units up Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy In c say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in Houston According to the accounts of three plant operators Reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt Etiwanda plant This happened as many as four or five times an hour Each time the units were ramped down an d electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up They would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men w ho only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired Afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston rather than the reliability needs of the ISO said Carl Wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism t o game the California energy market They and other power companies includin g AES Corp and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc and Dynegy Inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet Californias needs While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supplydemand balance As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design we are required to do that said Kevin Frankeny an operations official with Reliant When the ISO issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis It can go up and down many times within an hour Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the gr id managers ISO was not calling Reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators Not for an individual unit Officials with the California attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair busines s practices laws Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators When power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certa in amount of electricity over the given hour Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour By driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after thei r output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO Then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electrici ty rose in response to the reduced output By the time the ISO measured again the output was back at the expected level Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that i f the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right Other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston with some being more aggressive than others What they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said Then mysteriously the price woul d go up Then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output they d say Go up to That would cause the price to tank And theyd say Bring it down again Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said Moreover they were typically run at constant levels whi ch also reduced wear and tear They were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators They were increasing the fatigue on the units ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list o f plant shutdowns Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage los t among those companies Plants owned by Reliant AES Mirant Corp and Duke Energy Inc accounted f or more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capaci ty from all sources Reliant one of Californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in March and April It was followed by Mirant Corp of Atlanta AES Corp of Arlington Va and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte NC Reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough powe r for million homes for one hour Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts However an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair They are old At Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliants five California plants And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand But the operators said the issue is not so clearcut One problem at Etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previousl y reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem Moreover at the time of the shutdown the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online the operators said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations A nd an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant coowned by NRG and Dyne gy said the practice was used there although less frequently The scheduling calls came from Dynegys trading floor in Houston rather than NRG in Minneapolis he said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market In a May report the California Energy Commission cited Reliants Etiwanda plant as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants as some of t he major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring One way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met On one occasion one operator said Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to b e shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was The operator said Its

Press Writer SACRAMENTO AP Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast Its not out of the question say some lawmakers I actually think its a thoughtful plan to give folks an opportunity to understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the Assemblys point man on energy Keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts The Independent System Operator keeper of the states power grid is expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work The idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer Keeley said Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the stat e set a price limit on what theyll pay for power And if generators dont lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers Action Network says the states current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and f or a certain duration Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said I think w e would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell the ir unused electricity to other states or trim back production to keep supplie s short Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said I f businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the states power use and drive down prices Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices Bowen said California power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cashstrapped privately owned utilities Gov Gray Davis said the state paid per megawatt hour at one point last week The state has dedicated billion since midJanuary to purchase power fo r Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues billion in revenue bonds The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over years Planning ahead for blackouts Business services plan for summer crises By LOIS EVEZICH Aliso Viejo News No sooner did Aliso Viejo become the newest city in Orange County than California was hit with an energy crisis threatening rolling blackouts across the community Energy issues have already taken a priority with the councilelect and the city manager Weve had some meetings to familiarize ourselves with the situation said Interim City Manager William Woollett Weve hired an engineering firm to take a look at what kind of organization we need and what kind of budget we must have for this issue Woollett added that they havent done anything specific yet as Aliso Viejo is not a formal city until July Hilary McAllister head librarian at the Aliso Viejo branch of the Orange County Public Library said All the branches have a plan We plan to continue checking out books only doing the work by hand as long as it is safe Safety is the main issue and if that is a concern we might have to close Branches in the library system received instructions said McAllister and much of what they decide will have to do with how much warning time they have Were hoping the power company will warn us she said The library at Journey has been exempt from blackouts so far even when other areas in Aliso Viejo were hit McAllister isnt sure if that has anything to do with their location right across the street from the fire station Fluor Corporation with a large facility in Aliso Viejo which houses employees in its corporate headquarters and the fivebuilding campus a block away is well prepared for a blackout according to Lorie Serrato media representative We even have blackout kits for the elevators said Serrato They include bottled water snacks and flashlights She didnt know if there were also tranquilizers included for those who are claustrophobic Were getting used to taking the stairs she said And were learning to save our work on computers more often Thats important Barnes Noble experienced a blackout this winter For safety reasons customers were asked to gather at the front of the store and business went on though not as usual Customers who knew what books they wanted to buy asked employees to find them and sales were registered on calculators For safety reasons customers were not allowed where there was not adequate light Barnes Noble has cut lights in the back room to save energy and set the air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures Wendy Mortensen skating school director at the Ice Chalet at Journey said Weve been told that we are on the same power grid as the Sheriffs Substation and the Fire Department and that we wont lose power Mortensen said that in minutes not much would happen to the ice and if there is a blackout there is enough light during the day We are only running half the lights said Mortensen And we keep the offices and the hallways dark to conserve energy United Parcel Service is tightlipped about conservation measures They consider it proprietary information as the measures give them a competitive edge Overall the company said they can work during blackouts though it takes a little longer The facility does not have much activity during the peak energy hours but if it should happen during heavy work loads the facility can transfer the work to other shifts or to another UPS facility UPS in Aliso Viejo is part of the Edison Beat the Peak program designed to help companies conserve and prepare The facility has motion sensors in the offices and all employees have flashlights and other equipment as a safety precaution Kmart was awarded a million grant from the California Energy Commission in February It used some of that money to retrofit the Aliso Viejo store with energyconserving store lights that reduce consumption by percent The project is still under way with expected completion in the next severa l weeks Kmart also has uninterruptible power sources it uses as backups in case there is a blackout These backups provide minutes worth of energy used for the pharmacy and the cash registers In the event of a blackout t he store would close for new customers but could still service the customers already in the store Is price gouging root of crisis The president is allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of whom reside in Texas to get away with murder Gov Gray Davis said on Thursday in response to a George W Bush energy plan that doesnt call for caps on t he price of electricity sold by outofstate generators to California This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy problems Blame everybody else call for government price controls even though they historically have reduced the supply of energy and use divisiv e and even conspiratorial rhetoric On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan his appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission Loretta Lynch told a newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack up prices Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of wha t Ms Lynch called artificial shortages Were interested in seeing the evidence of course But it looks suspicious ly like politicians are using the powergouging theory as a way to bluster rather than come up with concrete solutions It also is a way for those who are ideologically hostile to deregulation perhaps cynical of business and capitalism in general to demonize merchant generators and pave the way fo r a government takeover No doubt wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed Prices zoomed from a megawatt hour late last year to nearly last week according t o the San Francisco Chronicle The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a cause of the price spike Yet a number of analysts have found the pricegouging theory to be dubious A Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dat a on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers Yes there were nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big producers in summer than in summer But as writer Mark Golden pointed out outages for all plants including municipally owned ones and small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system wer e percent higher in summer than in summer The writer notes tha t four of the Big are either constructing big new generators in California or have applied for permits to do so That would seem to fly in the face of a withholding strategy An April paper coauthored by William Hogan a professor at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University could not prove there wasnt manipulation but explained it is unlikely to be the dominant fact or and may not even be significant The bigger issue the Hogan paper argued is the seriously flawed restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse The principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown Other analysts argue that to whatever degree pricegouging has taken place it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules that have distorted the market The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy th e power generators say but the result of needed maintenance on facilities th at have been overworked Many of these are older plants that require more shutdowns for maintenance than new ones People can invest money in various different markets Jan SmutnyJones to ld us he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Associatio n in Sacramento which represents QFs and merchant generators With political ly charged hearings demonization of power generators proposals for excessprofits taxes and threats of seizing property made by California Democrats he said generators may conclude that California is a dangerous place to invest Gov Davis said the Bush plan wont add any new electrical power But neith er will Davis grandstanding about pricegougers In fact it may even dissuade electricity investment The governor needs to apply his will it create new power standard to his own rhetoric then ge t busy leading the state out of this mess Generator could help during future energy shortages City is the first fieldtrial customer for lowemission device By ANNALISA BURGOS Anaheim Bulletin Anaheim has taken several innovative measures to secure reliable power sources for its customers One such measure approved unanimously by the City Council on April is to be the first field trial customer for Indianabased Cummins Inc and Vancouverbased Westport Innovations Incs joint venture megawatt lowemissions natural gas power generator The Anaheim Convention Center will test the Westport natural gas fuel injection technology on a Cummins QSK litre diesel engine generator The technology allows diesel engines to operate on natural gas reducing emissions and allowing longer hours of operation up to hours per year compared to hours per year from other generators Public utilities is always looking for new environmentally efficient technologies spokeswoman Melanie Nieman said The generator will not be installed until this fall which means it will no t be available to help during this summers power crisis But officials belie ve it will be a valuable asset The CumminsWestport generator provides muchneeded electricity that meets environmental regulations and during peak periods can produce power for les s than the market cost of power general manager Marcie Edwards said The use of such onsite generators enables us to respond to customer needs while reducing Californias system demand The generator will provide offsite distributed generation that will be ab le to supplement Anaheims utility grid with power that may be called upon during state power emergencies or when the cost of wholesale market power i s high Anaheim gets percent of its energy supply from longterm power generati on contracts and percent on the daily wholesale market In addition the generator can provide about percent of the centers energy load and will serve as a source of backup emergency power Westport spokesman Alan Bayless said Californias energy shortage made it an ideal location to test the new technology Nieman said the city chose the Convention Center because it needed extra backup for its expansion Energysaving measures implemented By THERESA SALINAS The Orange County Register Stanton City Manager Terry Matz said that energysaving measures have been implemented at City Hall including the installation of light sensors that turn the lights on when people enter a room The city also has received a grant from Southern California Edison to replace current traffic signals with energysaving diode lights Matz said the city is also looking at the possibility of equipping major intersection s with battery backup systems to keep signal lights functioning Matz said that he is requesting be set aside in the budget to purchase new emergency generators for the Civic Center Calif Utilities Make Accusation LOS ANGELES AP via NewsEdge Corporation There is evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase energy prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission said An energy official called the allegation idiocy PUC President Loretta Lynch told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that her agency and the state attorney generals office are probing plant outages that she said created artificial shortages that contributed to skyrocketing power prices There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce She said that happened even when plants were obligated to do so under special contracts with utility companies and the state Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum dismissed Lynchs allegations as the height of idiocy Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting within the rules of the states deregulation system The reason many plants have been down in recent months Ackerman said is that power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer demand My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman who represents a trade association of large power producers But Lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the PUC and attorney general to take legal action next month against some power generators She did not identify them and the exact nature of the legal action is still under review she said Investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed records obtained after legal battles with the power companies to gather evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns Lynch said Power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were visited to examine operations and maintenance records Lynch said Power prices have gone from a megawatt hour in December to as much as last week and plant shutdowns have been a key factor in the soaring prices I would argue its no accident Lynch said That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel Lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged When operators of the states electricity grid declared a Stage alert which means that electricity reserves had dipped below percent plants that didnt need repairs were suddenly pulled offline PGE Targets Business Customers for Energy Reduction Utility Steps Up Efforts to Encourage Conservation Awaits More State Funding SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREMay via NewsEdge Corporation In conjunction with its customer education campaign called The More You Know About Conserving Energy the Less Energy You Need Pacific Gas and Electric Company has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely The utility is also working with state officials to determine how best to use the additional funding for conservation and energy efficiency which is contained in SBx signed into law by Governor Davis on April The California Independent System Operator has forecast power shortages of to megawatts between now and the end of summer Shortages that significant may result in blackouts for millions of Californians With little new generation available in time for summer peak use along with a continuing reduction of hydroelectric power from the Pacific Northwest Californians must adopt rigorous energy conservation habits if outages are to be minimized The energy crisis has taken its toll on all of us with higher energy costs and blackouts but we recognize that our business customers are especially hurt because they use a lot of electricity and outages not only mean a loss of productivity but can damage expensive sensitive equipment said Bev Alexander Pacific Gas and Electric Company vice president over energy management programs Since businesses account for about half of customer electricity consumption their efforts to conserve have a great impact on statewide energy use So we want them to utilize all the tools available to reduce their energy use Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers advice and incentives to help consumers make their businesses more energy efficient Rebates are available for installing more efficient lighting HVAC refrigeration and other mechanical equipment The utility has budgeted million for business energy management programs in The funding comes from ratepayers via the Public Purpose Programs charge on all customers utility bills and is not impacted by the companys Chapter proceedings In addition Pacific Gas and Electric Company has proposed to the CPUC how it could spend approximately million to support businessrelated energy efficiency programs from SBx funds which set aside million in taxpayer dollars to encourage residential and nonresidential energy conservation The utility also is encouraging customers to take simple steps such as turning off lights and equipment and adjusting thermostats to reduce the air conditioning load On a hot summer day percent of Californias energy use is air conditioning and commercial lighting Alexander said For example if commercial office buildings turned out every other light and set their thermostats to degrees we could save roughly megawatts or the equivalent of seven large power plants Measures like these could virtually prevent blackouts this summer To educate business customers on the energy crisis and steps they can take the utility holds informational workshops throughout its service area sends newsletters includes bill inserts utilizes paid advertising the Internet and news stories Business customers can obtain information about energy efficiency programs by visiting wwwpgecom or calling the Business Customer Center at PGE The business outreach program is just one element of Pacific Gas and Electric Companys customer education campaign called The More You Know About Conserving Energy the Less Energy You Need Note to reporters and editors for details on the available programs please also see the fact sheet entitled Energy Efficiency Programs for Business Customers ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS FOR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS In March Pacific Gas and Electric Company launched a customer education campaign entitled The More You Know About Conserving Energy the Less Energy You Need Along with advertising the Internet and news stories staff from the utility are holding workshops throughout the service area to educate business consumers on the seriousness of the problem and what they can do to conserve With demand for electricity expected to climb in the coming months and little new generation available the California Independent System Operator is forecasting severe power shortages that will likely result in blackouts for thousands of Californians The only way to reduce the threat of blackouts is for all consumers to reduce their electricity usage Because Pacific Gas and Electric Companys commercial customers account for about half of the power used the business community has the ability make a big impact with its conservation efforts Programs Available for Business Customers For Pacific Gas and Electric Company has enhanced its energy efficiency programs for business customers to achieve both energy savings

Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc PITTSBURGH The list of victims of Californias botched powerderegulatio n plan keeps growing When Californias electricity shortage surfaced last fall it caused spot prices of electricity to skyrocket all along the West Coast Some aluminum companies profited by temporarily closing their massive smelters in the Pacific Northwest and selling back their electricity to the spot market or to the Bonneville Power Administration the regions biggest power provider The aluminum industry which produces nearly of the nations output in the states of Oregon Washington and Montana commands a huge amount of electricity enough to power Seattle daily Closing the smelters freed up a lot of power and significantly reduced Bonnevilles reliance on the electricity spot market But Bonneville now wants the smelters in the region to stay closed for t wo years business executives economists and union leaders are just now assessing the economic impact of the plan And for the most part things dont look good for the small Pacific Northwest towns whose livelihoods revolve around aluminum For the aluminum companies closing plants isnt such a bad thing at least in the short term Besides getting a big chunk of cash from Bonneville the closures will cut nearly of the worlds aluminum smelting capacity Alco a Inc Pittsburgh the worlds leading aluminum producer says its closing its Ferndale Wash smelter idling metric tons or of its annu al capacity With that much aluminum off the market prices once expected to drop amid a slowing economy have instead firmed and are expected to rise Pechiney SA of France the worlds thirdlargest aluminum maker expects prices to jump at least by the end of the year as a result of supplyside bottlenecks Current spot prices for aluminum hover around cents a pound Alcan Inc of Montreal the secondlargest aluminum maker in the world says it expects more growth and better profits from many of its operations including its specialtypackaging business rolling mills and production of primary aluminum Meanwhile producers in India said they plan to take advantage of the bottleneck in the US by boosting exports Outside the Pacific Northwest existing smelters in the US are pretty mu ch operating at capacity says Michael F Gambardella metals analyst for JP Morgan Securities Inc The problems in the Pacific Northwest have kept aluminum prices relatively stable despite the current period of weak demand for aluminum The icing on the cake will be when the US economy starts to recover You will see aluminum prices skyrocket For companies using aluminum as a raw material rising prices may become another burden just as labor and energy costs and dwindling revenue damp profits But the biggest victims will be the rural towns in the Pacific Northwest whose economies have relied on aluminum since after the Great Depression when the US government supplied cheap power to run smelers in hopes of easing high unemployment Economists believe that if aluminum plants close for two years they will likely stay closed Operating aluminum smelters isnt like opening or closi ng a Eleven It costs a lot of money to shut the metalmaking operations dow n and then even more money to reboot the entire operation This is why alumin um smelters and similar factories run hours a day Additionally the way that the smelting operations are configured aluminum companies rack up losses if the plants operate at low capacities And remaining open isnt much of an option after Bonneville signaled that power rates will rise sharply in October when current contracts with the aluminu m companies expire Sharply higher rates will make aluminum production unprofitable For now Alcoa said it will not immediately lay off the employees at th e shuttered Ferndale plant primarily because Bonneville agreed to reimburse Alcoa for employee wages and benefits Still the news of plant closings is sending shock waves through communitie s such as Goldendale Wash a small town on the banks of the Columbia River Together Goldendale Aluminum Co and Northwest Aluminum Co employ about people more than onethird of the immediate areas working populatio n Those aluminum jobs pay about a year in salary and benefits The jobs created by these industries are the lifeblood of our communities say s Mark Sigfrinius Goldendales mayor They cannot be written off To ease the pain Bonneville is hoping that it can strike a deal so that th e aluminum makers in the region will take payments received for shutting down and use that money either to retrain the work force or to provide a lumpsu m payment to help them make it through the two years But the United Steelworkers of America representing workers in the affected Oregon Montana and Washington region says that its skilled work force would probably just leave the region and find work elsewhere under the BPA plan The union is jumping up and down about this says David Foster a negotiator for the union We intend to make absolutely sure that money com es to the union workers Two years is a long time

Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers Published May Gov Gray Davis on Thursday declared President Bushs newly unveiled power plan an inadequate proposal that turns a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state The Democratic governor who addressed reporters in Sacramento after Bush formally unveiled his proposal in St Paul Minn said California will not conquer its power crisis unless the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission temporarily caps the price of wholesale electricity The Bush plan which calls for opening more public lands to oil and gas exploration and tax credits for the purchase of fuelefficient cars woul d do little for the state in the short term when it needs help the most Dav is said For those of us who are already in immediate peril it offers no relief he said If those federal commissioners dont do anything to solve the problem then there will be a lot of blood on the floor and a lot of corpses along the way In Washington DC GOP congressional leaders vowed to speed key parts of the energy package to Bushs desk But the strong and conflicting response to the page report crafted over four months by a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney presaged an extensive debate on Capitol Hill Were going to have a crisis on our hands in the next two or three months said Rep Robert Matsui a Sacramento Democrat I just wish the president had attempted to address that If he doesnt like our idea of rate caps and price stability then at least he should come up with an alternative to try to get us through the next months But Republicans like North Carolina Rep Richard Burr vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee were quick to praise the package This is the most aggressive longterm energy policy our country has seen from an administration in a generation Burr said As in Washington California lawmakers split down party lines in response t o the presidents energy plan Democrats said the proposal would do little to help California in the short term while Republicans applauded its focus on increasing the power supply through expanded reliance on nuclear energy and other sources While environmentalists found several aspects of the blueprint troubling utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric Co and power generating companies said they were encouraged by the presidents call to speed the process of building new power plants transmission lines and natural gas pipelines It appears at first glance to be a very balanced document with combination s of conservation as well as the need to create new sources of energy said Keith Bailey chairman of Williams Co which markets electricity from Southern California power plants owned by AES PGE however which is mired in bankruptcy proceedings because of runaway wholesale power prices repeated its call for federally imposed price caps on wholesale electricity something Bush has specifically rejected On that one point at least the utility has found allies in Davis and othe r California Democrats Im calling on you Bush to find some creative way to give us temporary price relief while our new plants come on line Davis said State Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey and chairwoman of the Senate Energ y Committee echoed the governors plea We cant just focus on the long term here she said The patient will be dead before we get the lifesupport systems in place Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones who is running for governor also commended the president for proposing a comprehensive plan with longterm vision What President Bush understands that Gray Davis does not is that the time to propose solutions is not in the middle of a crisis but before when you see the warning signs and have time to plan a thoughtful course of action he said In one of more than specific proposals Bush urged the FERC to strength en its role in electric grid reliability partly through new laws that would l et it oversee mandatory industry standards Such a move could strip away some of the benefits of Davis proposal to buy the states transmission grid because it could extend federal control to transmission lines owned by public agencies said Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network It could also threaten the autonomy of municipal utilities such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Los Angeles Department of Wat er and Power and would face a vigorous fight in Congress Shames said Other specifics of the plan such as its recommendation to reassess offshor e oil drilling troubled environmental groups The president is probably too realistic to move immediately to reinstate drilling off Californias coast but opponents will have to stay vigilant t o prevent it said Warner Chabot a vice president of the Center for Marine Conservation The plan was also blasted by the California Public Interest Research Group for overreliance on new power plants drilling on public lands and increas ed subsidies for coal and nuclear power while the Sierra Club faulted the lac k of proposals to raise fuel economy standards for cars and sportutility vehicles Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said such standards are the biggest single step President Bush could have taken to cut our oil dependence and curb global warming The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or James Rosen of The Bees Washington Bureau contributed to this report Judge dims PGE producers shot at relief By Claire Cooper Bee Legal Affairs Writer Published May SAN FRANCISCO US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali delivered a sharp blo w to a large number of small energy generators signaling in an opinion released Thursday that hell probably require them to continue selling powe r within California and at stateregulated rates The tentative ruling in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co bankruptcy case denied most of the relief requested by the first four generators to have their cases decided The Central Valley powergenerating plants have warned that financial pressures may force them to shut down in June cutting into the power needed to avoid rolling blackouts this summer They asked to be released from their contracts with PGE or for higher pric es for the power they sell to the utility Montali responded by sweeping beyond the technical confines of bankruptcy law saying The court cannot and will not ignore other considerations such as the need to keep the generators online producing power for California While the four facilities provide less than percent of the utilitys electricity the tentative opinion sent out a broad message to scores of small power producers which together provide more than percent of PGEs electricity that Montali will give them just enough relief to kee p them generating Montali however said he isnt likely to release them from contracts to PG E that stand in the way of selling their electricity on the spot market possibly to the state Department of Water Resources at potentially extreme prices Montalis decision posted Thursday was dated Wednesday the same day the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order ensuring energy producers the right to sell to the highest bidder if they can get out of their contractual obligations Montali also declined to raise the price PGE must pay under current contracts While conceding the energy producers are entitled to a reasonabl e rate he cited FERC findings that under certain conditions spot market rat es in the California market have been unjust and unreasonable Instead Montali held out the likelihood of far more modest relief He ordered immediate negotiations to increase the cash flow sufficiently at th e four Central Valley power facilities Midset Cogeneration Coalinga Cogeneration Salinas River Cogeneration and Sargent Canyon Cogeneration with the goal of ensuring they will be able to perform when needed The four generators had warned in court documents of June shutdown scenario which would have cut into the power needed to avoid rolling blackouts this summer They are owed million out of a total billion PGE debt to producers of wind and solar energy cogeneration and biomass that provide roughly percent to percent of the electricity distributed by the utility Most including a plant that generates energy from rice hulls are small or midsized but several are owned by some of the nations largest corporations including Texaco Theyre paid on the basis of various formul as set by contracts or a formula set by the Public Utilities Commission Ed Feo a lawyer representing the creditors committee which will be included in the negotiations said Montalis tentative ruling will probabl y be the template for the way he deals with all of the small producers operating at PUCapproved rates that dont cover their costs The committee represents thousands of businesses and individuals who are ow ed money by PGE It had asked in a hearing a week ago that all of the small generator cases be consolidated for a single ruling because of the likely impact Montali refused saying the complications would be more than I can comprehend because each case presents different facts About two dozen facilities have petitioned Montali for relief so far including that have curtailed or ceased operations at times this spring claiming PGEs payments were insufficient to keep them online Several have hearings scheduled within the next three weeks but at least t wo Berry Petroleum and Crockett Cogeneration have reached settlement agreements with the utility In response to Montalis tentative ruling on the four Central Valley generators PGE spokesman Ron Low said only that the utility will meet wi th them and try to resolve the issues Lawyers representing the generators did not return phone calls Politicians try to stay plugged in Fear that the power crisis will shortcircuit their jobs pushes leaders to foster an active image By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol

filed suit against five energy generators Attorney General Bill Lockyer offered rewards of at least million to informants who could help prove market manipulation by power sellers And state Treasurer Phil Angelides has aggressively pushed for a staterun powe r authority Were seeing among a range of officeholders on the Democratic and Republic an side that they want to be seen as being out front of this issue said Mark Baldassare a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California As they go through this reelection year coming up they dont want to be accused by people who are competing for office of not doing anything Since January legislators have introduced at least energyrelated bill s including a proposal to finance the construction of an Auburn dam and anoth er to exempt farmers from paying sales and use taxes on diesel fuel during the last half of this year Whenever possible Gov Gray Davis schedules news conferences at power plants which provide optimal backgrounds for photo opportunities Power plants also are the focus of the states latest television and radio ads encouraging energy conservation which boast that California is workin g aggressively to build major new plants Although Davis chief political adviser Garry South says its a coincidence the Democratic governors political consultants recently teste d a spot that also touts the states record on power generation The energy crisis has led lowerprofile politicians to increase their visibility Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones who is running for governor and Democratic state Controller Kathleen Connell who ran for Los Angeles mayor have both used the crisis to criticize Davis leadership As lieutenant governor Bustamante generally remains out of the public eye and struggling for attention But the Democrat sponsored a bill that would make energy price gouging a felony and filed a civil lawsuit against five outofstate generators alleging a pricefixing conspiracy Bustamante said he is merely stepping up to calls from constituents who are clamoring for him to act Political consultant Richie Ross who works for Bustamante and other Democrats is convinced the energy crisis will have political consequences and could ultimately ruin careers He believes those lawmakers who take action to defend the public will hav e a better chance of political survival than those who dont The public is looking for who is on their side he said Theyre not interested in all the complexity Republican political consultant Wayne Johnson recommends that all politicia ns who want to be reelected engage themselves and get to know the power issue backward and forward Consultants say pollsters are busier than usual as politicians rush to determine their standing and that of their opponents with voters So far those who have seen the results say Republicans and Democrats are taking an equal beating Every politician in the states popularity rating is lower than it once was said Davis pollster Paul Maslin Though lawmakers like to say they inherited the crisis from the previous administration and Legislature that explanation doesnt resonate with Californians who are more interested in solutions Many voters are saying they dont care who was in power at the time deregulation was conceived and they dont care who is in power now South said They just want it to be over This is not a partisan thing Its a pox on everybodys house said David Townsend a Democratic political consultant People are basically saying Fix it The publics level of frustration is expected to escalate in the coming months when the effects of the power crisis multiply Baldassare is in the midst of surveying Californians on the energy crisis a nd has dropped in on a number of focus groups Many participants reported that theyre generally unhappy with the situation but still arent sure whom to blame According to Sherry Bebitch Jeffe a political scientist at the University of Southern California politicians are doing what they can to make sure its not them Each legislator out there is trying to insulate himself or herself from th e worst blame for the energy crisis she said Theyre attempting to inoculate themselves from inevitable attacks from opponents The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Bushs mixed message Fossil fuels tomorrow dont solve crisis now Published May President Bush seeks to focus public attention on tomorrows energy challen ge while doing little to prevent a looming electricity crisis that may start i n California this summer and spread to other parts of the country The existing crisis is so serious and so neglected by the president it wi ll be hard for Californians to focus on his glossy new energy blueprint which he unveiled Thursday with campaignstyle fanfare Documents such as these this one has more than specific recommendations when successful end up serving the broader purpose of launching public discussion and political debate This time though the president has no choice but to enter this debate in the present not the future California waits wonders and bleeds as billio ns of dollars in excess electricity profits go to generating companies and traders Whats so perplexing about this president is the emerging philosophical inconsistency between how he sees the energy future and the present Line b y line recommendation by recommendation Bushs longterm energy strategy proposes to fully insert the government as a guiding hand of tomorrows energy marketplace Rather than leave the market to itself Bush seeks to shape it via direct subsidies tax incentives or new fossilfuel opportunities on public lands Yet today for California the president sticks to a handsoff approach rejecting intervention in a horribly distorted electricity marketplace Why Viewed as an alacarte menu Bushs energy strategy offers something for everyone Appetizers range from tax breaks to fuelconscious motorists who want to buy hybrid cars to billions of dollars in new research to burn coal more cleanly The main course however is more fossil fuels and more nucle ar power plants And some cuttingedge stuff such as new funds for alternativ e fuels research are tied to one controversial source royalties from new gas and oil development in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge The charts and graphs all speak to matching future supply with demand as i f the challenge is two dimensional It is not The third piece barely mentioned by Bush is global warming Energy policy must address not avoid the compelling evidence that our fossilfuel consumption is dangerously warming the planet Bushs plan doesnt mandate improvements in any vehicle s fuel efficiency by a single mile per gallon Viewed by other countries that take global warming more seriously Bushs energy plan will be the equivale nt of political gasoline We need to have a serious discussion about the nations longterm energy future Bushs plan whatever its shortcomings started the debate But eve n more than talk California and the West need federal action to curb runaway wholesale electricity prices this summer Bush yesterday failed to step up to the challenge Bush energy plan greeted with avalanche of praise criticism By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON Battle lines hardened Thursday over President Bushs energy policy leaving little apparent room for compromise House Democrats began the day with a hightech assault on the plan that featured three San Diegoarea residents pleading via satellite for immediat e relief from soaring utility bills and blackouts An environmental group staged a more lowtech stunt dumping five tons of coal in front of Vice President Dick Cheneys residence Republicans meanwhile embraced the plan But some cautioned that its legislative elements were likely to be tinkered with and that some relief f or consumers may have to come quicker than Bush envisions Much of the Democratic criticism centered on Bushs failure to offer immediate help for the power crisis rocking California and the high gas prices plaguing motorists They also repeated their accusation that by stressing more use of oil coal and nuclear power Bush was sacrificing the environment for the sake of energy industry profits To dramatize those arguments Reps Susan Davis and Bob Filner both San Diego Democrats used a satellite broadcast to beam three constituents into a packed news conference on Capitol Hill The lawmakers have been pressing fo r price controls on wholesale power sold in California a strategy Bush has rejected We need help now said Patti Finnegan who runs Niederfranks Ice Cream i n National City I understand that we need more supply but in the meantime I dont think thieves should be out legally taking our money like this Finnegan said the business power bills had quadrupled and that rolling blackouts have the potential to put me out of business by melting her inventory Michael Brucker executive director of San Diegos Jackie Robinson YMCA an d San Diego resident Jaime Salazar told similar tales of soaring power bills and sacrifice Its a really great plan if youre a seller of energy But if youre a consumer of energy this is not a good energy plan said Davis It was crafted behind closed doors with a lot of input from energy executives and in a highly secretive way that doesnt serve the public interest added House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt DMo It real ly looks like the ExxonMobil annual report and maybe thats really what it is Republicans countered that the proposal was balanced They cited Bushs cal l for tax credits for energy conservation and efficiency and his promise to take environmental impacts into account as domestic oil drilling is expande d Rep Randy Duke Cunnigham REscondido called the blueprint comprehensi ve and mindful of the environment While Bush didnt talk about it in the plan the administration has taken several steps to aid to California Cunningham said including expediting permits for new power plants Weve got to throw out the extremists on both side of this and solve the problem he said Republican leaders said they would start hearings on the plan as early as next week and hope to have a bill finished by midsummer Fearing a voter backlash if they appear to be ignoring consumer complaints about high energy costs some GOP lawmakers are advocating shortterm measures like immediate tax incentives for home energy conservation and suspension of the federal gasoline tax Congress will be working with the president to enhance his plan I wil l be offering some amendments said Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison RTexas Despite the heated rhetoric from the Democrats Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle DSD refused to declare the Bush plan deadonarrival Obviously there is a lot there that we can work together on Were hopeful that we can do that Daschle said Outside interest groups will have a big influence on how the debate unfolds and on molding public perceptions of the Bush plan Environmentalists vowed to join Democrats in a sustained attack that includ es rallies advertising and attentiongrabbing stunts like the coal dumping at Cheneys residence which was orchestrated by Greenpeace Cheney led the White House task force that developed the energy policy We are going to continue keeping up the pressure on the BushCheney administration over the summer because we think this is going to be a hot issue said Greenpeace spokesman Gary Skulnik Supporters of the Bush plan in the business community including energy companies have organized the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth to counter the environmentalists message and lobby for the Bush plan What this country needs to do is diversify its energy portfolio Weve got a huge challenge in front of us said Bruce Josten executive vice president for government affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce Bush warns country about California By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May ST PAUL Minn President Bush took to the road Thursday to sound dire warnings about a darker future for the nation if it fails to follow his path of more oil drilling and nuclear plants After touring a power plant fired with new technology the president urged the country to rally around his justunveiled energy plan or risk seeing power problems now plaguing California spread If we fail to act this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in California he said If we fail to act Americans will face more and more widespread blackouts If we fail to act our country will become more reliant on foreign crude oi l putting our national energy security into the hands of foreign nations som e of whom do not share our interests And he added if we fail to act our environment will suffer as government officials struggle to prevent blackouts in the only way possible by calling on more polluting emergency backup generators and by running le ss efficient old power plants too long and too hard But trying to build support for the report previewed the night before by White House officials and to stay ahead of the criticism of some of it s politically controversial recommendations the president also sounded a n optimistic note that stressed technology and conservation as the keys to avoiding Californias missteps Bush called for a new harmony between our energy needs and our environment al concerns arguing that energy development and environmental protection wer e not at odds He made only passing references to the reports proposals to drill in an Arctic wildlife refuge bury the nuclear power industrys waste and commandeer private lands in order to expand interstate electricity transmission grids Proposals such as those have aroused the ire of many Democrats and environmentalists who charge Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney the reports main author with using the energy situation as a pretext to give an economic boost to the energy industry that made them wealthy Meanwhile Bush cited his own roster of villains President Clinton Ir aqs Saddam Hussein and California He noted pointedly that the nation beginning in the early s made strides in energy efficiency but declared that this improvement slowed in the s during the Clinton administration He also defended his proposal to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by noting that doing so would produce barrels a day for the next years He added That happens to be exactly the amount we import from Saddam Husseins Iraq Bush started his visit here by dropping by a power facility that combines innovative heat and power technologies to burn coal natural gas oil and renewable wood biomass to provide lowcost heating to large buildings a nd singlefamily residences in downtown St Paul Minn and adjacent area s In his speech Bush referred to the facility and noted other technological advances that have led to a solar powered house that produces more energy than it uses and to hybrid cars that can convert to battery power to redu ce emissions and get up to miles per gallon These are our early glimpses of a future in which Americans will meet our energy needs in ways that are efficient clean convenient and affordable That future is achievable if we make the right choices now Later he praised the state as an impressive conservation leader but added California has not built a major new power plant in a decade And n ot even the most admirable conservation effort could keep up with the states demand Bush argued that his plan will speed up progress on conservation where it has slowed and restart it where it has faltered At the same time he described the report as an effort to cut through the federal governments regulatory regime to make it possible for Americans to reap conservations rewards Warning that the countrys growing dependence on foreign oil sources poses a national security threat Bush described technology as a way out of the dilemma and added New technology makes drilling for oil more productive a s well as environmentally friendly than it was or years ago Bush argued that the renewal and expansion of existing nuclear facilities can generate tens of thousands of megawatts of electricity at a reasonable cost without pumping a gram of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere Reprising one of his signature campaign promises Bush said Just as we ne ed a new tone in Washington we also need a new tone in discussing energy and the environment one that is less suspicious less punitive less ranco rous Weve yelled at each other enough Gov Davis attacks Bush energy plan By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS May SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis attacked President Bushs energy plan Thurs day accusing the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state The Democratic governor said Bushs pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities offers no shortterm relief for Californias rolling blackouts and record power bills By not doing anything Bush is allowing the price gouging energy companies many of whom reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said Californians wants to know if Bush is going to be on their side Davis said Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others on the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal tha t the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer With little notice the outages have swept through the state snapping off power to home s and businesses from San Francisco to San Diego Bush announced his longterm energy plan Thursday in St Paul Minn and h e has yet to visit California the state in the grips of the nations worst energy crisis But shortly into the speech Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on t he light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his page energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of t he good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Davis agreed that California is likely only the first state to experience a power crisis Were the first one in line to suffer We want to look out for the interes ts of other states that could be affected in a year or two he said He urged the president to look at creative solutions such as ordering th e power generators to refund some of the recent high wholesale power prices His long term approach is basically ontrack but for those of us who are in immediate peril it offers no relief Davis said California is in danger of spiraling into a recession because of the high wholesale energy costs are literally dragging down our economy he said California Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte said he thinks the president s plan will help California particularly in helping to speed construction of new power plants Brulte said its a mistake for California to blame Bush and the federal government for its problems Gov Davis and his administration made significant mistakes on this energy issue and rather than trying to find a solution hes playing the political blame game Brulte said Carter recalls an energy crisis that was far worse By Calvin Woodward ASSOCIATED PRESS May WASHINGTON Less than two weeks into his presidency Jimmy Carter donne d a sweater and went on TV to tell Americans they should turn down their thermostats and learn to live thriftily Now nearly a quarter century after the energy crisis that dogged him Cart er says Thursdays problems are not so bad No energy crisis exists now that equates in any way with those we faced in and Carter said Thursday in an article in The Washington Post He noted that world energy supplies are adequate and stable and automobil es arent waiting in line at service stations President Bush released his energy plan Thursday emphasizing the need to increase production and proposing incentives for energy to be used more efficiently He is not proposing the tough efficiency standards or penalties for energy waste that Carter fought for But the former Democratic president said Bush does not have as big a problem on his hands Two major oil crises struck the US economy in the s first in and then in the late s during Carters presidency as major oil export ers reacted to the Iran hostage crisis causing gas station lineups and high prices Carter was defeated in partly because of fallout from the energy crisis Now he says Bush should seek a balance between conservation and new energy production just as he did Although Carters plan was known mostly for its push to curb demand he als o acted to spur coal production and speed the approval of nuclear power plant s as well as encourage alternative energy Carter in his column also renewed his opposition to Bushs plans to drill in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge In Carter signed a law that protected the refuges millionacre coastal plain where the oil i s while opening percent of Alaskas coastal areas to oil exploration Carter wrote that some officials are using misinformation and scare tactic s to justify such environmental atrocities as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge He added that drilling advocates are careful to conceal the facts that almost none of the electricity in energytroubled California is generated from oil In his February address to the nation Carter said the energy shortage s could be dealt with if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifices if we learn to live thriftily and remember the importance of helping our neighbors Then in April he declared the moral equivalent of war on the energy crisis and outlined tough measures including a tax on gasguzzling cars Governor signs bill on energy authority Legislation allows state to build plants By Bill Ainsworth and Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS May SACRAMENTO Declaring California at war with pricegouging energy producers Gov Gray Davis signed legislation yesterday that he said would allow the state to fight back by building its own power plants Were retaking control of our own energy destiny Davis said The power will be generated here It will stay here and it will be made available to the people of California at reasonable prices The bill is the most farreaching legislation sparked by the energy crisis Many cities including Los Angeles and Sacramento have publicly owned utility districts but the state has never owned or operated plants on a large scale The legislation which takes effect in days creates a state power authority that can finance build or seize plants and is controlled by four appointees of the governor and the state treasurer Its modeled on a New York agency that operates power plants Californias new authority could issue up to billion in bonds to pay for the construction of new plants The bonds would be paid off by revenue from the power produced by the plants The goal of the new state authority is to break the states dependence on electricity imports controlled largely by outofstate companies Californi a imports percent of its electricity Davis said he believes the authority could start building peaker plants by September Such plants operate when power demand is at its highest Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco who authored Senate Bill X said it would have the longest and most lasting impact on Californias ability to reduce electricity prices and end rolling blackouts State Treasurer Philip Angelides who sponsored the bill said it will hel p ensure that California is never again held hostage by an unregulated privat e energy market run amok Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks has derided the plan as socialism Davis said he was disappointed that no Republicans supported the bill sayi ng its a sign that they have retreated to their ideological point of view an d refuse to be problemsolvers At the news conference Davis said a California Energy Commission report shows huge increases in the number of power plants out of service in the first four months of over a similar period last year To me this is strong evidence that people are manipulating the market by withholding the power to drive up prices he said Energy producers have denied withholding power saying they are maintaining their aging plants because they have to operate them longer and harder to provide California with more power Davis called on power companies to run their plants during the summer when blackouts are expected routinely or face the penalties If they dont act responsibly and do everything in their power to help us get through the summer which means operating at full capacity then Ill have no choice but to sign a windfall profits tax and seize a plant he said To curb soaring power costs two Assembly members introduced a resolution urging Davis to form a buyers cartel with Oregon and Washington to limit t he price the three states will pay for power Assemblymen Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek and Paul Koretz DWest Hollywood said the buyers of power must act because federal regulators have refused t o cap the wholesale prices that generators can charge We will pay these power generators a fair price but we will no longer all ow ourselves to be cash cows Koretz said Davis said he would consider the plan The formation of a buyers cartel was proposed last month by a San Diego consumer group the Utility Consumers Action Network which also said the state should consider planned blackouts to give consumers time to prepare A generator spokesman said state officials should have begun planning earli er for choosing between paying high prices for power and more blackouts In a crisis I think this kind of decision has to be made said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum Its economic triage Meanwhile federal energy regulators whose reaction to Californias proble m has been criticized by state officials waded into the dispute over the rol e of smallcapacity generators yesterday The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed operators of the plants to sell electricity to third parties if they have more power than they need to meet their contracts But FERC did not approve a plan releasing the generators known as qualifying facilities from longterm contracts with the states two biggest utilities which have had trouble paying their bills California Governor Gray Davis had urged FERC to stay out of the issue saying state officials were working with small power producers and cogeneration plants to solve the problem State to review Escondido power plant plan UNIONTRIBUNE May ESCONDIDO The California Energy Commission was expected to start the day review period today for a megawatt power plant proposed for Enterprise Street Jonathan Brindle the assistant planning director told the City Council yesterday that CalPeak Power of San Diego had supplied all the necessary paperwork to the commission The commission has scheduled a public hearing for pm May in the City Council chambers To the dismay of Escondido officials CalPeak withdrew its application with the city recently and is seeking a state permit Escondido officials maintain that CalPeak will still have to obtain city approval but the commission has said it will have final say under an executive order signed by Gov Gray Davis PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion Power She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create artificial shortages An industry spokesman calls the accusation idiocy By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ Times Staff Writers State investigators have uncovered evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency working with the state attorney generals office is probing patterns of plant outages that have created artificial shortages particularly when the state has issued emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said in an interview at The Times And it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce even when they were obligated to do so unde r special contracts with the state and utility companies Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough information for the PUC and attorney generals office to take legal action against the generators next month The exact nature of that action she sai d is still under review Lynch who is an attorney did not name specific suppliers or provide documentation of her assertions She said that information will remain confidential until court proceedings are undertaken Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark et in any unlawful way including orchestrating plant shutdowns They say the facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha t breakdowns are a recurring problem Lynch and Gov Gray Davis who has been particularly critical of outofstate generators have not suggested that every plant shutdown has been unwarranted In fact the governors top advisor on power plants released a stateme nt last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was justified and that the companys officials were accommodating State Atty Gen Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi nt investigation with the PUC A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyers office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wideranging probe of possible civil and criminal violations So far the attorney generals office has subpoenaed documents in categories from generators including records of plant operations pricing practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another about Californias power market Were looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair business practice laws Lockyer has told The Times Although he has not provided details of his offices findings he recently said the inquiry is beginning to get interesting Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass ed during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous subpoenaed records obtained after intense legal battles with the power companies In addition investigators have been entering plants where unplanned shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records Lync h said At times the investigators have been denied access and have had to exert legal pressure to get in she said The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices whic h have gone from a megawatthour in December to as high as last week I would argue its no accident Lynch said of the high prices That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the rules of Californias flawed deregulation program which allowed them to bu y power plants formerly run by the states three largest utilities Gary Ackerman a spokesman for a trade association of large power producers said Lynchs allegations were the height of idiocy The reason many plants have been down in recent months he said is th at power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe r demand He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman executive director of the Weste rn Power Trading Forum State analysts have argued however that power traders can reap extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power that is sold are so high According to Lynch investigators have found that some companies were more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat e the states power market She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern When operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage alertmeaning th at electricity reserves have dropped below plants that do not need repairs suddenly are yanked offline That she said aggravates the shortages and the cost of wholesale electricity soars Before December state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up prices primarily through bidding At the time the market was designed to p ay all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the states grid operato r That changed in December when new federal regulations restructured Californias wholesale power market to loosen price controls Lynch said Since then a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emergednot coincidental ly in my view she said Now she added the state has endured historically high levels of unplanned plant outages The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by utility companies because they have not been going off line at record levels Lynch said The California Energy Commission reported last week that the states electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several times higher than in the last two years A Times analysis of state data found that throughout the last two months about megawatts of production was offline more than a third of the peak power used in California on a typical day That has been about evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns By contrast shutdowns in the same period of and took only to megawatts offline Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electrici ty supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise prices The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any wrongdoing However FERC released a study in February of closures at three other California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcit y of power After talking to plant operators by telephone reviewing documents and visiting the three plants federal inspectors concluded that the companies appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generatin g facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and incurring additional expenses Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this story Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark Effect Presidents energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the powerdeprived Golden State By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS Times Staff Writers California lawmakers analysts and others waistdeep in the states power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House energy plan By the time many of President Bushs proposals kick in it will be too late to do the Golden State much good This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the next critical months groused state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey You cant focus just on the long term here Because the patient will be de ad before we get the lifesupport systems in place Gov Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are draining Californias treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases Instead the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil increased reliance on nuclea r power and more than billion in tax credits for conservation and energy development Most of Bushs proposals however are slowacting remedies and many others already are being applied in California which was hit by energy woe s far ahead of other states The plans dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices experts say Overall the message in this plan is Drop dead California said Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation a San Franciscobased research and advocacy group I dont think it delivers another megawatt to California added Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the power crisis as an ongoing emergency rather than a temporary one Californias supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer once new power plants of them licensed in the pipelinestart churning Its not that we dont have longterm problems said Stephen Levy director of the Palo Altobased Center for Continuing Study of the Californ ia Economy Its just that energy isnt among them Others including many environmentalists say Bush could have made a noticeable impact by for example beefing up energy efficiency programsa quick clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand Why not provide aggressive incentives rebates to get people to purchase more efficient air conditioners asked Dan Reicher assistant Energy secretary in the Clinton administration Over the course of the yea r a program like that can make a dramatic difference because air conditionin g consumes nearly onethird of Californias peak energy supply Instead Reicher noted Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency standards for air conditioners a move that critics say will require the country to build new power plants Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California were clouded by doubt Bush for example directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to relieve a key transmission bottleneck known as Path between Northern and Southern California But he specified that the upgrade which requires building a mile line at an estimated cost of million be funded by nonfederal contributionsmeaning the financially strapped utilities migh t be expected to bear the cost Gov Davis who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from Washington said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an d criticized the president for allowing the pricegouging energy companies many of which reside in Texas to get away with murder Davis said the state is doing everything possible to build and conser ve our way out of the problem but it desperately needs federal price control s on energy costs In California energy users spent about billion this year even with consumption down the bill could top billion But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney who led the task force that prepared the plan are opposed to price caps preferring to let market forc es reign Davis said that laissez faire approach puts Californias economy in peril Just saying over the long haul everything will work out is turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state Davis said Small businesses literally will go out of business because the y cant afford these rates Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California Bush recommends building power plants over the next yearsabout eight plants a month But California is already on a plantbuilding spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year s The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi ng for a renewed commitment to nuclear power The California governor however has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive order issued in February There is little evidence meanwhile that Californians are eager to approve an expansion in nuclear power Nationwide not one new nuclear plan t has been licensed in more than years And a Times Poll in February found that of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state You can barely build cleanburning gas plants here let alone nuclear plants said Edward Kahn a San Franciscobased energy consultant with Analysis GroupEconomics Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines Currently the US governments power to forcibly acquire private property applies only to highways and gas pipelines Expanding that power is likely to enrage property owners and propertyrights advocates who typically expect backing from Bushstyle conservatives Im just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the states authority over its own land said Lynch of the PUC The issue is already heated in California Communities in southwestern Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas Electrics attemp ts to use eminent domain to obtain private land for miles of transmission lines The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energ y officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for priva te acreage Bush also proposed a unified private national electricity grid an id ea that seems at odds with Southern California Edisons effort to sell its transmission lines to the state But Edison officials said they hope to hav e their deal worked out long before the presidents idea comes to fruitioni f it ever does Unveiling his energy program in St Paul Minn Bush said he is deep ly concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good peop le of the state of California But S Davis Freeman the former Los Angeles Department of Water and Power chief who is now the governors

customers should not be deprived to aid others By SCOTT GOLD Times Staff Writer A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the federal government today to exempt them from blackouts Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in California and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled outjust as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages Most Californians pay large investorowned utilities like Southern California Edison Co for power But about a quarter of households from th e tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital are billed for electricit y by cities counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit utilities There are municipal utilities Four of themserving Los Angeles Burbank Glendale and the Imperial Valley east of San Diegoare independent of the state power grid and do n ot face any outages But the others are required by contract to give electrici ty back to the California Independent System Operator which runs the grid by participating in rolling blackoutsalthough they have plenty of power to serve their customers It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs said California Municipal Utilities Assn attorney Tony Braun These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions behind the deregulation of Californias electricity market and the power shortage We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and that we dont have the rightnor does anyone elseto take it away from th em when they need it said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans Our customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t o Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts Vernons public utility has customers all but of which are industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants T he city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state said Jorge Somoano Vernons assistant director of resource management FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the campaign Up to half including Riverside are expected to either file thei r own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon said Washington attorne y Bonnie Blair who represents municipal utilities in Azusa Banning and Colt on Even the campaigns supporters are unsure whether it will succeed Bla ir acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal challenge to FERC which is expected to decide on the issue by midJune An d she said municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don e enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis Some cities with municipal utilities such as Anaheim are not plannin g to join the campaign Marcie Edwards general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities said the relationships between municipal utilities and CalISO are too complicated t o make a clean break She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed entirely on the large investorowned utilitiesincluding this summers energy crunch And until that can be proved she said municipal utilities still have an obligation to support Californias power grid Its not right to go either way she said The fact remains th at municipals still have an obligation to serve Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through agreements with CalISO that call for them to share electricity in an emergency Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for natural disasters such as earthquakes or other sudden and monumental problems such as a plane running into a transmission line The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient supplies Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC does not constitute an emergency The obligation to share in rolling blackouts did not contemplate situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to provide resources to serve their customers Blair said If they are force d to participate in rolling blackouts the effect is that the ISO is taking energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it Jim Detmers CalISOs vice president of operations said the organization plans to fight the campaign He said emergency provisions of CalISOs agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy crunch Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha ve their own electricity distribution He compared the exemption request to a homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbors because he wants to kee p his water for himself What were dealing with is an overall shortage Detmers said We wa nt to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyones lives are at risk Ronald Nunnally Edisons director of federal regulations and contract s said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the power grid to which they are connected The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole if you will under all circumstances he said Blair said those arguments dont hold up Indeed she said the municip al utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits giving public property such as electricity bought by a municipal utility to a private enterprise such as investorowned electric companies Our customers are paying for it she said Thats the bottom line Californians fault Bush energy proposal GARY GENTILE AP Business Writer Friday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT LOS ANGELES AP Government officials environmental groups and many energy consumers found little comfort in President Bushs national energy plan released Thursday The plan which includes a pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities was sharply criticized by Gov Gray Davis who accused the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others to the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal tha t the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer Customers of t he states two largest private utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison will see unprecedented rate increases soon In announcing his plan Thursday Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on t he light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of t he good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Some consumers didnt see the presidents sympathy I dont really think he has my concerns as his priority said Jodi Reynolds a Culver City legal secretary I can already see that I need to conserve energy I dont need the president to tell me that Others gave Bush credit for addressing the nations longterm energy needs but faulted the president for not doing more for California now We give him kudos for addressing the supply issue said Brian Bennett vi ce president of external affairs for Southern California Edison one of the states cashstrapped electric utilities However when it comes to addressing the California crisis the Bush administration has chosen to ignore what they could have done to help lesse n the crisis here impose on a shortterm basis costbased pricing on the wholesale market That theme ran through some of the comments by the states environmental an d consumer groups In the last energy crisis a handful of nations in the Middle East had us over a barrel said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Now its a handful of energy companie s in the Southern United States The only solution is to bust the Texasbased OPEC Environmentalists said Bushs energy policy lacks proposals that could offe r shortterm relief from higher electricity and gasoline prices such as powe r price controls incentives for more efficient appliances and tighter fuelefficiency requirements for vehicles The Bush plan also steps away from assurances he made during the campaign that he would not rescind a moratorium on new offshore oil leases created b y his father and extended until by President Clinton The plan calls for the secretaries of commerce and the interior to reexamine the moratorium We are concerned what he is stepping toward said Allison Detmer manager of the ocean and resources unit of the state Coastal Commission which is suing the federal government over the existing leases This might be the first step toward opening up the coast again Some utility and government officials said Bush correctly focused on expanding the nations energy infrastructure building more natural gas pipelines and strengthening the electricity transmission grid But the presidents support for new nuclear power plants won little support The political realities in California are were not going to see an increased reliance to nuclear power in the near future said Carl Wood a member of the California Public Utilities Commission Perhaps predictably state Democrats found little to like in Bushs plan while Republicans found much to praise The presidents plan will help California this summer by expediting new power plants and ordering state agencies to conserve said Rep

power plants shut down to drive u p prices Friday May Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT LOS ANGELES AP There is evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase energy prices the head of the Californ ia Public Utilities Commission said An energy official called the allegation idiocy PUC President Loretta Lynch told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that her agency and the state attorney generals office are probing plant outages th at she said created artificial shortages that contributed to skyrocketing power prices There are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to Lynch said And it is clear that there are instances that plants whe n called to produce chose not to produce She said that happened even when plants were obligated to do so under special contracts with utility compani es and the state Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum dismissed Lynchs allegations as the height of idiocy Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting within the rule s of the states deregulation system The reason many plants have been down i n recent months Ackerman said is that power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer demand My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said Ackerman who represents a trade association of large power producers But Lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the PUC and attorney general to take legal action next month against some power generators She did not identify them and the exact nature of the legal action is still under review she said Investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed records obtaine d after legal battles with the power companies to gather evidence of alleged ly unnecessary plant shutdowns Lynch said Power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were visited to examine operations and maintenance records Lynch said Power prices have gone from a megawatt hour in December to as much as last week and plant shutdowns have been a key factor in the soaring prices I would argue its no accident Lynch said That in fact its due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel Lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged When

years into the future including one to allow the government to seize private lan d to build transmission lines and another to speed the permit process for pow er generators That will be cold comfort to millions of Californians whose lights and laptops go dark this spring as they confront staggering increases in utilit y bills TOUGHLOVE APPROACH As California faces the prospect of a long energydeprived summer the administration has clung to a toughlove approach insisting that shortter m fixes like the price limits advocated by Democrats will compound the problem down the road Warned by California Republicans that such an approach could have political ly disastrous consequences the administration in recent days has softened its language speaking more sympathetically about Californias plight Bush aides suggest that some immediate price relief might come from the psychological effect of knowing that more energy supplies are on the way The quicker you implement this policy the quicker were going to get rid of some of the problems like California is experiencing a senior administration told reporters at a briefing Pressed specifically on what recommendations would ease the states current troubles the official pointed to a plan to speed the permit process for power plants something he acknowledged has been going on for months Youve got to look at this from the perspective that its been neglected f or a long time the official said of Californias problems Its going to ta ke some time DEMOCRATS SPEAK OUT California Democrats some who feel the outrage of their

the White Houses laissez faire attitude carries a human toll The president can say the problem will correct itself and thats true but there will be a lot of blood on the floor along the way Davis said I do not think he wants Californians to suffer however by doing nothing Many Democrats have hinted that Bushs handsoff policy toward California might be different if it wasnt benefiting oil interests from his home stat e of Texas This lengthy document will not provide one more kilowatt to California thi s summer prevent one less minute of blackouts or keep one less dollar from being transferred

to take legal action bu t she declined to say what penalties the power generators could face Thats not within the PUCs bailiwick Lynch said last night Lockyer could not be reached for comment Although

credits for biomass energy development could be boon for tw o of the states thriving industries Tom Abate Chronicle Staff Writer Friday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive B UDTLtypeDnews Included in the Bush administrations page energy plan is a call for ta x credits to spur the development of biomass a form of energy generation tha t spans everything from oldstyle wood burning to futuristic processes such a s extracting ethanol from agricultural waste Although Bush envisions biomass playing a tiny role in solving the nations immediate energy woes highlevel support for the technology could be important for two California industries biotechnology and agriculture Sharon Shoemaker director of the California Institute of Food and Agricultural Research at the University of California at Davis is a proponent of using biotechnology to reinvent biomass as an industry The ai m is to extract clean energy and mineral byproducts from plant waste while giving distressed farmers a new market for harvest leftovers Theres no commercial biomass plant like this out there yet but were just on the verge of making it happen said Shoemaker who will hold a biomass conference at Davis in June Californias biomass industry which contributes about percent of the states electricity is based primarily on burning waste wood from sawmills forests and orchards The keys to reinventing biomass are genetically engineered bacteria and bioengineered enzymes that can turn cellulose the material that gives plants their strength into ethanol in a process similar to fermenting grain or grapes into alcohol In addition to producing ethanol to blend with gasoline new biomass breweries would extract valuable minerals from plants and even convert the cellulose in plant waste into plastic substitutes Some of our members are making shirts that feel like polyester but theyr e made from corn not oil said Megan Smith with the American Bioenergy Association a Washington DC lobby whose members include the Palo Alto biotech firm Genencor International After ethanol and mineral byproducts have been extracted from plant waste biomass plants would burn the remaining material called lignin the substance found in peat bogs Left alone over geologic time lignin would compress and turn into coal Evidence of Bushs interest in biomass surfaced earlier this year when the administration slashed research budgets for alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power but barely touched biomass research Some of that money came to Northern California biotech firms Genencor and Novozymes Biotech in Davis each recently won competing million research contracts to cut the expense of turning cellulose into ethanol Today the enzymes used in the process cost cents per gallon of ethanol produced Novozymes President Glenn Nedwin said We want to get it down t o cents a gallon From political and policy viewpoints Bushs affinity for biomass is clear Gregg Morris director of the Green Power Institute a Berkeley nonprofit that performs alternative energy research recalled a recent ethanol conference in Las Vegas One of the agricultural lobby guys said that whenever he visits administration officials he brings a map that shows which states voted for Bush Morris said The map showed solid Republican support in the farmbel t states that would benefit most from biomass techniques that provide new markets for field waste The policy rationale for biomass energy was laid out in a article titl ed The New Petroleum that appeared in the influential journal Foreign Affair s The authors Sen Richard Lugar RInd and former CIA Director James Woolsey warned that America was headed for economic disaster and another Gulf War unless it reduced oil imports The vehicle they said was to use biotechnology to turn abundant farm waste into ethanol If genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced processing technologie s can make a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels affordable the worlds security picture could be different in many ways they said making anothe r oil embargo or Mideast war less likely The nation annually consumes about billion gallons of gasoline and produces about billion gallons of ethanol The new biomass fever must be tempered by recognition that todays biomass industry is controversial and subsidized and the futuristic processing plants envisioned by boosters exist only in the pilot stage California for instance has biomass plants in operation fueled primarily by wood waste Morris said An equal number of biomass plants has been idled or dismantled for a variety of reasons including a lack of wood for fuel The fastest way to ramp up the wood supply would be thinning the states forests but that could stir environmental opposition Morris said In the Midwest biomass has a different though no less controversial meaning In the grainproducing states biomass means turning corn kernels into ethanol The same kernels that might get popped in the movie theater o r fed to the livestock are instead put through an ethanol conversion plant Two factors make this possible First corn kernels are rich in starch whi ch is relatively easy to ferment The stalks and the cobs which contain the cellulose so valued in biomass dreams are thrown away because they aren t economical to convert Second and steeped in controversy is a centpergallon federal subsidy that helps put it on par with competing petroleum products Free market groups such as the Cato Institute in Washington DC have attacke d this as a handout to the corn belt that primarily benefits one company Archer Daniels Midland the nations leading ethanol producer Backers of the new biomass are counting on that subsidy to help support the challenging task of taking ethanol from cellulose waste Without the cent agallon subsidy the corn ethanol industry wouldnt be here today said Mike Bryan of BBI Associates a Colorado firm that conducts feasibilit y studies for ethanol plants The cellulose ethanol industry will need simil ar support for a while Although much of the talk about biomass centers on futuristic applications the newest aspect of the Bush energy plan benefits the oldest form of bioma ss burning waste to generate power Smith the Bioenergy Association lobbyist said Bush has proposed giving biomass power generators access to an existing but unused tax credit of cents per kilowatt hour When Congress enacted the credit in it was intended for biomass generators who burned plant matter specifically grown to harvest as fuel This has cost the treasury nothing because nobody does it said Morris the Green Power expert in Berkeley Bush has proposed making this credit available to biomass furnaces that bur n waste wood something that would benefit California biomass generators Seeking a renewable resource President Bushs energy plan calls for tax credits to promote the developme nt of biomassbased fuels Biomass systems use bacteria or heat to convert far m waste into energy and products The Iowa Energy Center project is using cornstalks Heres a look inside the demonstration

Tom Abate at Todays energy shortages far less ominous than in frantic s Posted at pm PDT Thursday May KEN MORITSUGU WASHINGTON As President Bush unveiled his energy plan Thursday nearly new power plants were under construction across the United States and drilling rigs were burrowing for new sources of natural gas Todays high energy prices and shortages are driving massive energyindustr y investments that over time with or without government intervention wi ll bring supplies up and prices down To call the current situation a crisis is an exaggeration with the excepti on of the severe electricity shortage in California that all but guarantees temporary blackouts this summer and possibly next It pales in comparison with the s crises that forced motorists to line up for limited gasoline supplies and drove the US economy into recession Theres an electricity crisis in California said Paul Krugman a Princeton University economist Nothing else out there justifies talking about a crisis Energy demand surged in the late s and the capacity for delivering and refining the stuff didnt keep up basically because produce rs were caught by surprise So we have high prices by recent standards but al l that will solve itself That does not mean there are not serious energy issues facing the nation including bottlenecks in making gasoline from crude oil and delivering electricity over heavily burdened transmission lines and natural gas throug h nearly full pipelines But even todays high gasoline prices when adjusted for inflation are percent lower than their historic peak in Consumers enjoyed a period of extremely low energy prices for most of the s Such depressed prices wont return anytime soon Instead homeowners and drivers are likely to be saddled with higher prices for gasoline heati ng oil and natural gas for months and maybe a few years While higher energy costs always pose a threat to the overall economy its a much more distant one today than in the s Then oil prices soared percent in a year and the impact rippled through gasoline and electricity markets By comparison energy costs rose percent last year and are projected to rise an additional percent this year according to DRIWEFA a Lexington Mass economicforecasting firm Were better off today because we have a much more diversified energy supply said Jim Osten chief energy economist at DRIWEFA The country is much less dependent on oil particularly for electricity generation where the use of coal nuclear and more recently natural gas ha s expanded Also conservation has helped contain though it hasnt stopped the growth in energy use The one risk is California In the end disaster probably will be avoided but its going to be nasty Krugman said Outside California the outlook is much less bleak Power companies have built or significantly expanded power plants in the past months according to Resource Data International a Boulder Colobased energyinformation and consulting firm An additional are under construction up from this time a year ago That pace of construction is enough to meet the upper end of the Bush administrations estimate that the country will need to new pow er plants over the next years We are on the right road and we are building up front a lot of what is needed over the year period said Judah Rose managing director of wholesale power at ICF Consulting a Fairfax Vabased energyconsulting firm Richmond Vabased Dominion sees no power shortages in its markets in Nort h Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia said Thomas Capps the companys president Likewise the naturalgas market is adjusting to recent supply shortages th at drove up prices last winter when the weather turned unusually cold As of last week there were rigs drilling for gas in the United States up fr om up from a year ago and two years ago according to a weekly survey by Baker Hughes Inc a Houstonbased maker of drilling equipment As the price rises theres economic incentive to drill more said Gary Flaharty director of investor relations for Baker Hughes Eventually youll drill to the point where there is enough gas on the market and the price will come down Still future gas supply will have to keep up with new demand from the construction boom in power plants the vast majority of which are powered b y natural gas To meet that expected demand most analysts support construction of a proposed pipeline to bring in new supplies of natural gas from Alaska Bush also has proposed opening previously restricted federal lands in the Rockies to exploration for natural gas While environmental concerns surrou nd these areas economists say there is enough of a projected need for natural gas that they should not be written off without review We need a coherent set of policies for deciding on when and how access to federal lands will be opened up to gas and oil exploration and development said Paul Joskow director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Polic y Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology This inevitably involves a careful assessment of the environmental consequences of exploration and development in particular areas and research and developmen t on ways to minimize environmental damage Ultimately the problem may not be finding natural gas or generating electricity but getting those products to where they are needed New pipelines and electric transmission lines need to be built to keep up with the nations growing appetite for power In many cases local oppositi on has blocked construction Also uncertainty surrounding what the rules will be for electricity deregulation has reduced the incentives to build transmission lines while increasing the risks I think the power plants will get built but moving the power around and moving the gas to them is going to be problematic Dominions Capps said Seth Borenstein contributed to this report Contact Ken Moritsugu at Bush points to California as

blackouts skyrocketing fuel costs and more dependence on foreign oil unless the nation follows his energy strategy America cannot allow that to be our future And we will not Bush said as he formally presented his energy program at a fuelefficient plant in St Paul The presidents page plan seeks to increase supplies of virtually all fuels by easing federal regulations and encouraging production It also encourages energy efficiency and calls for constructing more and better energydelivery systems such as pipelines power lines and refineries In California Democratic leaders criticized Bush for doing little to furth er regulate an energy market that is daily sucking up tens of millions of dollars from the states treasury I want to commend President Bush for facing up to Americas energy crisis I agree with him that we need more supply Gov Gray Davis said Thursday in Sacramento But I fault the president for not providing California with a ny immediate relief Davis has asked the federal government to cap wholesale electricity prices We are literally in a war with energy companies who are pricegouging us and the only person who can give us relief is the president Davis said I have no legal authority none over the price of wholesale electricity The Bush administration has consistently opposed price caps and the energy policy announced Thursday offered little to deal with Californias immediat e electricity crisis Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif called the energy plan a bible for longterm energy production and not even a pamphlet for the urgent shortte rm actions needed to help us get out of the crisis in her home state She particularly criticized Bushs refusal to call for price caps on electricit y in California Stage set for battles Congressional leaders promised swift action to turn Bushs proposals into law but hard fights lie ahead Democrats and environmentalists condemn the plan as a sellout to Big Oil Many of the proposals pit powerful interest groups against each other along lines they have fought over bitterly for decades And energy politics typically split the nation by region as fuelproducing Sun Belt states are often in conflict with pricesensitive consumers in Frost Belt states Even Bushs allies concede that Congress is likely to reject his proposal t o drill for oil and gas in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Other flash points of controversy include his proposals To give the federal government authority to erect power lines on private land To consider easing cleanair restrictions on old coalfired electric plant s To possibly pursue energy exploration in federal lands in the Rocky Mountains and coastal waters that are now off limits To boost reliance on nuclear power The president said his recommendations would head off a potentially ble ak future by seeking a new harmony between our energy needs and environmenta l protection But if we fail to act this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in California Republicans blame Democratic neglect in the Clinton years for the nations energy woes If you look

promote his plan today during a visit to a Pennsylvania hydroelectric plant that has taken steps to protect fish If the Bush plan were implemented in full it would potentially double what the administration had planned to spend over years for renewableenergy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energyefficient products like hybrid cars But the estimated billion commitment over that period is below what the Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some

groups and many energy consumers found little comfort in President Bushs national energy plan released Thursday The plan which includes a pledge to speed up power plant permits and conserve at federal facilities was sharply criticized by Gov Gray Davis who accused the administration of turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state Davis repeated his plea for the federal government to impose caps on wholesale energy prices that he says have driven the states largest investorowned utility into bankruptcy and two others to the brink of collapse If he wants to be helpful to California he could send a strong signal th at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should grant some kind of relief he said California has been struck by six days of rolling blackouts since January and officials predict more as temperatures rise this summer Customers of t he states two largest private utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison will see unprecedented rate increases soon In announcing his plan Thursday Bush warned that California is previewing the power troubles the nation could face if it doesnt boost its energy supply and cut demand Californians are learning regrettably that sometimes when you flick on the light switch the light does not come on at any price Bush said He said his energy plan provides solutions that will help ease the states power woes Im deeply concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good people of the state of California and my administration is committed to helping California Bush said Some consumers didnt see the presidents sympathy I dont really think he has my concerns as his priority said Jodi Reynolds a Culver City legal secretary I can already see that I nee d to conserve energy I dont need the president to tell me that Others gave Bush credit for addressing the nations longterm energy needs but faulted the president for not doing more for California now We give him kudos for addressing the supply issue said Brian Bennett vice president of external affairs for Southern California Edison one of t he states cashstrapped electric utilities However when it comes to addressing the California crisis the Bush administration has chosen to ignore what they could have done to help lesse n the crisis here impose on a shortterm basis costbased pricing on the wholesale market That theme ran through some of the comments by the states environmental an d consumer groups In the last energy crisis a handful of nations in the Middle East had us over a barrel said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpaye r and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Now its a handful of energy compani es in the Southern United States The only solution is to bust the Texasbased OPEC Environmentalists said Bushs energy policy lacks proposals that could offe r shortterm relief from higher electricity and gasoline prices such as powe r price controls incentives for more efficient appliances and tighter fuelefficiency requirements for vehicles The Bush plan also steps away from assurances he made during the campaign that he would not rescind a moratorium on new offshore oil leases created b y his father and extended until by President Clinton The plan calls for the secretaries of commerce and the interior to reexamine the moratorium We are concerned what he is stepping toward said Allison Detmer manag er of the ocean and resources unit of the state Coastal Commission which is suing the federal government over the existing leases This might be the first step toward opening up the coast again Some utility and government officials said Bush correctly focused on expanding the nations energy infrastructure building more natural gas pipelines and strengthening the electricity transmission grid But the presidents support for new nuclear power plants won little support The political realities in California are were not going to see an increased reliance to nuclear power in the near future said Carl Wood a member of the California Public Utilities Commission Perhaps predictably state Democrats found little to like in Bushs plan while Republicans found much to praise The presidents plan will help California this summer by expediting new power plants and ordering state agencies to conserve said Rep Randy Cunningham REscondido Theres nothing in there for California Nothing said Rep Brad Sherma n DLos Angeles The headline is Bush to California drop dead Bush says the right stuff Published Friday May in the San Jose Mercury News PRESIDENT Bush may tour innovative power plants and put conservation first in his energy speeches but until the money and the regulations back up the rhetoric well suspect him of being a fossilfuel kind of guy Bush covered the spectrum of energy options in the muchawaited plan he released Thursday more conservation more supply more wires and pipes to get the power to the people All must play a part But Bushs background in the oil business and the rol e of energy producers in drafting the plan foster the impression that hes mo st enthusiastic about loosening the environmental leash on the oil coal and nuclear industries A failure to act Bush repeatedly implied would leave the nation in the sa me straits as California now finds itself The comparison is inexact California would have benefited from better ener gy planning five years ago But the current shortage has little to do with environmental obstacles to new plants or a lack of fuel Its caused by a dysfunctional market On that score Bush continued to reject the one federal action wholesale price controls that might help California get through the summer without paying a kings ransom for electricity California would benefit in the years to come from Bushs call for improvements in the transmission system for gas and electricity Retrofitti ng and expanding an aging network would provide both more energy and greater flexibility in its distribution Underlying Bushs plan is the thesis that fossil fuels will remain central to Americas energy supply for decades to come That may be true But the role of national energy policy is not primarily to augment the supply of fuels t he free market already easily provides Burning fossil fuels creates smog and global warming The government ought to be leading the search for ways to squeeze more energy from fossil fuels and for alternatives to them Whether from conviction or from the backlash over Vice President Cheneys recent disparagement of living with less Bush offered some plans to improv e efficiency and conservation Hed spend billion on tax credits for the purchase of gasolineelectric hybrid cars In all billion in tax credi ts would stimulate conservation Drafting the federal budget for next year however Bush cut research on energy efficiency by a third and on renewable fuels by half On one obvious target for greater efficiency mileage standards for cars Bushs energy plan is far too timid proposing only to study them America has been backsliding on fuelefficiency stricter standards are overdue Bush seeks instead to find more fuel to put in the tank Hed drill in th e Arctic Wildlife Refuge a needless environmental insult that Congress thankfully is unlikely to countenance With revisions in a host of environmental regulations Bush would make it easier to extract oil or natural gas from public lands or under coastal waters Exploitation of natural resources is last centurys energy policy The domestic resource Bush should be exploiting more energetically is Americas ingenuity to use energy more wisely FTCR Bush Energy Plan Will Make California Crisis Worse Taxpayer Boondoggles More Deregulation Equals Higher Prices Taxes LOS ANGELES May US Newswire via COMTEX via NewsEdge Corporation The BushCheney energy plan will make things worse for beleaguered Californians who are facing an economic and public health catastrophe this summer as a result of deregulation a Californiabased citizen group said today Californias facing a catastrophe because a handful of energy companies ha ve seized control of our electricity supply under deregulation and have been manipulating the supply of electricity to create artificial shortages and maximize their profits said Harvey Rosenfield president of the nonprofi t Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights The federal government could stop this assault and order rate reductions and refunds of overcharges Instead the BushCheney plan calls for more deregulation massive tax breaks for energy companies and the construction of multibillion dollar boondoggles like nuclear power all of which will benefit the same energy companies that are holding California hostage With BushCheney Plan Crisis History Repeats Itself FTCR noted that the last energy crisis to strike America was inspired not by supply shortages but by greed of the OPEC nations which in the s us ed their control of petroleum supplies to create shortages and massive price hikes American energy companies took advantage to profit from their resources as well In response the US Congress passed a thenstaggering multibillion dolla r billion package of tax breaks and grants to the energy industry to build po wer plants that would manufacture synthetic fuels These plants ultimately became taxpayerfunded boondoggles while nuclear power hailed by the energy industry as a source of clean energy turned out to be prohibitively expensive and a public health threat Ironically Californias deregulation law required ratepayers to pay o ff over billion of the California utility companies bad debts most of wh ich were incurred by the utilities as costoverruns in construction of nuclear power plants in the s Californias economy health and safety and the quality of life in the Golden State are threatened by the skyrocketing energy prices inspired by deregulation The BushCheney plan not only does nothing to protect us against the energy cartel it calls for more deregulation higher taxes and prices said Rosenfield In the last energy crisis a handful of nations in the Middle East created a cartel to exploit their control over energy supplies two decades later a handful of energy companies from the Southern United States have created a cartel to exploit their control over our electricity supply

summer Power Politics In Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Avidly Than Ever CEO Lay Leaves an Imprint On Bush Energy Plan Seeks Friends at FERC An Interstate for Electricity By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhou r with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among othe r things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled yesterday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says h e sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energ y companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and ga s monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they nee d the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensu re that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it want s those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annua l stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy a nd you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwat er overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market powe r of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he cal ls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout a nd riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owne d by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesal e energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quick ly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a frien d of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened the ir networks to competitors For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utilit y regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aide s Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any M s Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathit t through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but tha t she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restauran t in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendl y with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford He s been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enro n according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In Apr il when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won th e presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr L ay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishin g or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged i n March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House politic al adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reduction s in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White House officials Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison In both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all The Cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity As Enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them An effort to make the grid national would enhance FERCs power as Enron has urged The report is mum on some Enron concerns such as requiring utilities to jo in regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utilit y industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involve d in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western stat es and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevad a repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states o r perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the t wo chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framewo rk the governors might want to consider Though Mr Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr Racicot had joined the Washingto n DC lobbying firm Bracewell Patterson Mr Racicot didnt disclose that he was on retainer to Enron and the star of Enrons Western states advocacy team For his part Mr Racicot says he was working not at Enrons direction but with their knowledge to advance positions that he too feels are important Jeffrey White contributed to this article National Desk Section A THE ENERGY PLAN THE OVERVIEW BUSH PUSHING ENERGY PLAN OFFERS SCORES OF PROPOSALS TO FIND NEW POWER SOURCES By DAVID E SANGER with JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company NEVADA Iowa May President Bush began an intensive effort today to sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the American people arguing that the country had a future of energy abundance if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between energy producers and environmental advocates Mr Bushs plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals many that he can impose by executive order for finding new sources of power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies His critics swarmed over the specifics noting that the plan set no targets for improved energy efficiency offered no shortterm relief for outofcontrol electricity prices in the West and provided only modest financing for research into clean energy technology The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near St Paul that burns a variety of fuels including oil coal and waste wood to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day The parties in the energ y debate have yelled at each other enough Mr Bush said Now its time to listen to each other Excerpts Page A Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and environmental protection Mr Bush added before flying here to a farmin g town north of Des Moines to continue his argument at a small biomass plant that makes power by burning materials derived from animal waste and plants As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about Americas energy future as if the people who produce Americas energy do n ot care about the planet their children will inherit Mr Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political thread arguing that if America failed to act now this great country could face a darker future a future that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California Mr Bush also said rising energy prices had put an intolerable burden on families and farmers But some of the statistics in his own report seemed t o undercut that claim One chart showed that the share of disposable househol d income spent on energy had declined to less than percent today from percent during the early days of the Reagan administration That percentag e has begun to rise again but only to the levels of the mids before a sharp drop in energy prices Mr Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail raising the specter of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreig n oil suppliers He argued for example that the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve which he wants to open to drilling can produce barrels of oil a day for the next years That happens to be exactly the amount th e United States now imports from Iraq he said Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention wit h Democrats and some moderate Republicans many of whom argue that the Bush administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuel s at the expense of the environment Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced approach it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and conservation America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies said Senator Joseph I Lieberman Democrat of Connecticut The energy crisis i s not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis Republicans offered far more support for the president Senator Frank H Murkowski of Alaska chairman of the Senate Energy Committee said he plann ed hearings next week to begin consideration of recommendations in the Bush report that require legislative action Not everyone is going to like this plan Mr Murkowski said but at least now we have a plan to kick around He said the previous administration had failed to grapple with the nations energy sources through a comprehensive plan Clinton administration officia ls disputed the assertion and blamed Congress for failing to enact energy legislation Yet even Mr Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Mr Bushs approach He said the report offered few immediate remedies for Californias electricity crisis or for rising gasoline prices He said Republicans might have to consider a gastax rollback or the temporary suspension of some environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks Mr Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a longterm energy polic y His report contained initiatives although many of them are endorsements of actions already in place And while in his public comments he always started with talk of conservation the report itself was much more specific when it came to tapping new supplies No matter how much we conserve were still going to need more energy he said here this afternoon The State of California is the second best stat e at conservation and yet they are still running out of energy Among those who took a different view was former president Jimmy Carter wh o wrote in The Washington Post this morning that the United States did not confront an energy crisis comparable to those of and World supplies are adequate and reasonably stable price fluctuations are cyclical reserves are plentiful he argued Mr Carter said exaggerate d claims seem designed to promote some longfrustrated ambitions of the oil industry at the expense of environmental quality Some chapters of the energy plan resemble the annual reports issued by ener gy companies with color photos of bears living happily in the wilderness forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and flyfishermen wading in pristine water practicing the favorite sport of the reports main author Vice President Dick Cheney While the report clinically assessed all the available sources of energy an d promised to encourage development of those that do the least environmental damage it fell far short of describing the moonshot approach to efficienc y and renewable energy that was an ambition of the Carter years In fact federal spending on research and development of wind solar geothermal and biomass energy sources as well as on energy efficiency technology has never equaled the billion spent in Mr Carters final year in office even after adjustments for inflation If the Bush plan were fully put into effect it would potentially double wh at the administration had planned to spend over years for renewable energy research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase energyefficient products like hybrid cars But the estimated billion commitment over that period is below what the Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some cuttingedge energy technologies commonplace Americans spend billion a year on energy said John Holdren an energy and environmental policy expert at Harvard who helped draft a Clinto n administration study of clean energy sources The Bush people are proposi ng to change habits by incentives that amount to about onetenth of one percen t of that amount each year Its not very significant Though the report devotes more chapters and more recommendations to measure s related to the environment conservation and renewable energy than those related to traditional sources the impact of what the administration intend s to do to increase traditional energy supplies greatly outweighs what it aspires to do to diminish demand The report notes that efficiency in homes and offices could help reduce the need for new power plants which it says must total at least by But it adopts no goal for such improvements In the same manner addressing auto efficiency standards the report review s how Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates improved the performance of combustion engines in the s But it puts off any decision on whether t o raise those standards now saying the administration would wait for a study to be completed The report is far less tentative in the area regulations it identifies as hindering the oil gas nuclear and utility industries It mentions about a dozen areas including landuse restrictions in the Rockies lease stipulations on offshore areas attractive to oil companies the vetting of locations for nuclear plants environmental reviews to upgra de power plants and refineries that could be streamlined or eliminated to help industry find more oil and gas and produce more electricity and gasoline California where soaring electricity prices and rolling blackouts have bee n the main contributor to the idea that the nation faces on energy crisis ge ts little in the Bush plan The report notes that federal agencies have been asked to reduce peak power use in California in coming months but that is far less than California officials want Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California called the plan a bible for longterm energy production and not even a pamphlet for the urgent shortterm actions needed to help us get out of the crisis in her home state She particularly criticized Mr Bushs refusal to call for electrici ty price caps in California In what seems likely to be one of its most contested recommendations the Bush team recommends creating a national electricity grid akin to the interstate highway system and giving federal agencies the right to take la nd for electricity transmission by eminent domain That proposal has already come under attack by Western governors and is sure to be a battle in Congress Photos President Bush Christie Whitman head of the Environmental Protection Agency and Mayor Norm Coleman of St Paul second from right with officials of a power plant that burns

Washington Post FINAL Page A Copyright The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved ST PAUL Minn May President Bush unveiled his muchanticipated energy policy to the nation today from the banks of the Mississippi River warning of widespread misery if Congress resists his plan to increase the countrys power production Bush flew to a convention center here to announce his proposals after fo ur months of deliberations winning acclaim from Republicans and the energy industry which stands to make billions of dollars from his ideas and complaints from Democrats and environmentalists who hope to exploit the policy as a way to portray the president a former Texas oilman as a captive of industry If we fail to act Americans will face more and more widespread blackouts Bush said America cannot allow that to be our future and we will not The president adding a tone of urgency to his longterm proposals said a future without new sources of energy is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and rolling blackouts in t he great state of California In California Gov Gray Davis D accused the administration of turnin g a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exists in this state He excoriated Bush for refusing to cap wholesale energy prices We are literally in a war with energy companies many of which reside in Texas Davis said The White House today released the full page report which provides more detail but follows closely the outline Bush advisers introduced Wednesday night Bush seeks reduced regulations to encourage more oil gas and nuclea r production tax incentives to boost coal output and other tax incentives aimed at conservation and renewable fuels The president said the nation needs to new power plants over the next years and additional miles of natural gas pipelines and miles of distribution lines Some of the proposals notably the call to drill in Alaskas Arctic Nati onal Wildlife Refuge are considered nonstarters in Congress where the plan is likely to be amended with more shortterm solutions to the California energ y squeeze But the bulk of the recommendations are in executive orders and regulatory changes which the administration can do with little resistance Bush plans to sign an order next week directing federal agencies to expedit e permits for new energy plants The presidents allies in Congress vowed swift action House Resources Committee Chairman James V Hansen RUtah said his panel would work quick ly to accommodate the plan by opening up protected areas for oil drilling and coal mining The thrust of the energy recommendations could be seen today in the init ial reactions satisfaction from industry consternation from conservationists Its balanced I think it has something for everybody and it addresse s the problems that should be addressed said Thomas E Capps chairman of Dominion Resources Inc the Richmond energy company that is Virginias largest electricity supplier California has an energy crisis now The res t of the country is going to have one unless something is done Industry representatives voiced few if any objections at a White House briefing an administration official took a lengthy pause when asked if any part of the report would disappoint industry Thats a good point he sai d noting tax credits that go to conservation rather than oil and gas Leading environmental groups held a joint news conference in Washington to denounce Bushs proposal which they said would spoil natural resources but do little to ease the shortterm energy shortage They unveiled a televisio n ad featuring a mock auctioneer selling the nations resources to the highes t bidder And they argued that Bushs plan by increasing reliance on fossil fuels would increase global warming emissions by percent over years Environmentalists were particularly miffed that the plan ties the few benefits conservationists sought to more controversial elements such as expanding drilling on public land In what is a truly cruel joke the Bush plan would also use oil revenues from the Arctic refuge to pay for land protection and renewable energy programs said William H Meadows preside nt of the Wilderness Society Thats like burning your furniture to heat your home Objections came from government watchdogs too The libertarian Cato Inst itute argued that the administration is simply positioning itself to take credit for what the market is already busily accomplishing Cato analyst Jerry Taylor said the nation is in a power plant construction boom with megawatts of new capacity to be available by and as much as megawatts by This will not only burst the electricity price bubble b ut will probably produce an electricity glut in the near future Taylor said He decried a smorgasbord of handouts and subsidies for virtually every energy lobby in Washington On Capitol Hill reactions to Bushs proposals fell predictably along pa rty lines House Speaker J Dennis Hastert RIll pledged to start hearings immediately on the plan which he praised as wellbalanced I believe it meets the goals most important to the American people by increasing our energy supplies providing price stability and protecting our precious environment he said in a statement House Minority Leader Richard A Gephardt DMo on the other hand he ld an elaborate news conference in the Capitol with other Democrats that featured a satellite connection to three San Diego residents facing rising energy prices We think the presidents plan makes the wrong choices for America and the American people Gephardt declared in front of projected images of a gas pump and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge It was crafted behind closed doors with a lot of input from energy executives and in a highly secretive way that doesnt serve the public interest Democrats say they view the issue as one of the GOPs top vulnerabilities in the months to com e Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss said he wants to begin heari ngs on one big energy policy bill next week House Energy and Commerce Committe e Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa whose panel will move much of the energyrelated legislation predicted his committee would take up conservation measures first and then move to the question of supply In the coming months Tauzin said Congress will take steps to allow consumers to sell power back to their local energy grids urge the auto industry to adop t stricter fuel efficiency standards and promote better transmission technologies Bush is the first president since Jimmy Carter in to ask Americans to think about their energy supply and the tones were as different as the times Carter proposed a windfall profits tax for oil companies and asked citizens to follow the speed limit drive fewer miles a week and carpool once a week Bush declared Conservation doesnt have to mean doing withou t Thanks to technology it can mean doing better and smarter and cheaper The plan leaves many issues to be hashed out For instance it directs E nergy Secretary Spencer Abraham to propose comprehensive electricity legislation that promotes competition while protecting consumers It directs Transportation Secretary Norman Y Mineta to consider higher fueleconomy standards for new vehicles but said they must increase efficiency without negatively impacting the US automotive industry Before Bushs speech he toured a power plant that

Bush drew applause from the crowd which had been selected by a local business group when he called on his critics to work with him Just as we need a new tone in Washington we also need a new tone in discussing energy and the environment one that is less suspicious less punitive less rancorous he said Weve yelled at each other enough Now its time to listen to each other and act Still Bush could
