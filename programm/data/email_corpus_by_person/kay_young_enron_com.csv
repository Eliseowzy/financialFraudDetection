received this communication in error please notify us immediately by email and delete the original message TravisMcCullough enroncom To cc PM Subject Debbie I appreciate the point on the damages issue New York law is fine as the governing law for this agreement I have discussed the section with our outside counsel and left a voicemail for the commercial team I am generally comfortable with the effect of that provision with respect to patents that have not been issued however we feel that a cause of action for willful violation should still be available with respect to patents that have been issued In other words it makes sense that you should not be found to have willfully violated a patent that you didnt know existed but if it is brought to your attention and there is subsequently a willful violation I dont want to have to explain why we waived our right to pursue that Our outside counsel has suggested the following language as an alternative In connection with its due diligence review or otherwise each party and its affiliates may obtain Confidential Information regarding pending patent applications of the other party or its affiliates the Patent Applications In the event of a patent infringement suit based on a patent issuing from any such Patent Application against the party receiving Confidential Information regarding such Patent Application the party that disclosed the Confidential Information and entities controlled by the disclosing party hereby agrees that it will not raise as evidence in support of willful patent infringement of any patent issuing from such Patent Application the fact that the party received the Confidential Information regarding such Patent Application under this Agreement This agreement shall not be construed to preclude the offering of any other evidence in any such patent infringement case including evidence that the party receiving such Confidential Information learned of any such issued patent after the date of issuance and evidence of the actions of the party receiving such Confidential Information after learning of the issuance of such patent issuing from the Patent Application If this is not acceotable one alternative that would allow the Friday meeting to proceed would be to sign the CA without this provision since it is highly unlikely that the teams will be able to disclose a lot of information regarding intellectual property that might be subject to patent protection during the course of a one to two hour meeting We could then try to work this issue out before the next substantive meeting that the businesspeople have Ill actually be able to discuss this in the morning before I leave in case we need to work something else out before the meeting Ill try to call you first thing Travis McCullough

received this communication in error please notify us immediately by email and delete the original message TravisMcCullough enroncom To cc PM Subject Debbie I appreciate the point on the damages issue New York law is fine as the governing law for this agreement I have discussed the section with our outside counsel and left a voicemail for the commercial team I am generally comfortable with the effect of that provision with respect to patents that have not been issued however we feel that a cause of action for willful violation should still be available with respect to patents that have been issued In other words it makes sense that you should not be found to have willfully violated a patent that you didnt know existed but if it is brought to your attention and there is subsequently a willful violation I dont want to have to explain why we waived our right to pursue that Our outside counsel has suggested the following language as an alternative In connection with its due diligence review or otherwise each party and its affiliates may obtain Confidential Information regarding pending patent applications of the other party or its affiliates the Patent Applications In the event of a patent infringement suit based on a patent issuing from any such Patent Application against the party receiving Confidential Information regarding such Patent Application the party that disclosed the Confidential Information and entities controlled by the disclosing party hereby agrees that it will not raise as evidence in support of willful patent infringement of any patent issuing from such Patent Application the fact that the party received the Confidential Information regarding such Patent Application under this Agreement This agreement shall not be construed to preclude the offering of any other evidence in any such patent infringement case including evidence that the party receiving such Confidential Information learned of any such issued patent after the date of issuance and evidence of the actions of the party receiving such Confidential Information after learning of the issuance of such patent issuing from the Patent Application If this is not acceotable one alternative that would allow the Friday meeting to proceed would be to sign the CA without this provision since it is highly unlikely that the teams will be able to disclose a lot of information regarding intellectual property that might be subject to patent protection during the course of a one to two hour meeting We could then try to work this issue out before the next substantive meeting that the businesspeople have Ill actually be able to discuss this in the morning before I leave in case we need to work something else out before the meeting Ill try to call you first thing Travis McCullough
