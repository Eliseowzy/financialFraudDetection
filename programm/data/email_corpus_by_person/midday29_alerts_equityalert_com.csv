BRCM follows from E quityAlertcom Broadcom Simplifies Gigabit Ethernet System Designs Wit h New Micron QuadSquadTM Gigabit TransceiverDIndustryStandard RGM II With Broadcoms Unique Builtin Timing Adjustment Reduces System Layout Complexity by More Than Percent IRVINE Calif Oct PRNewswi re via COMTEX Broadcom Corporation Nasdaq BRCM the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications today announced the latest member of its QuadSquadTM family of Gigabit Ethernet quad tran sceivers optimized for highport density Gigabit Ethernet switches and rout ers The BroadcomR BCM quad transceiver features the Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface RGMII which reduces system design complexity by over percent as compared with the traditional GMII interface The BC M and other members of the QuadSquad family facilitate deployment of Gi gabit Ethernet bandwidth to the desktop by increasing port density and lowe ring system cost Utilizing advanced micron process technology Broadc oms Gigabit transceivers also achieve the industrys lowest power consumpt ion of less than one watt per port With the introduction of the BCM we have reduced design complexity lowered system cost and accelerated ti metomarket for our customers said Marty Colombatto Vice President and General Manager of Broadcoms Networking Business Unit Our transceiver in cludes a unique builtin timing delay mode to eliminate the timing delay tr ace called for in the RGMII specification By accommodating this timing del ay onchip the BCM can save up to square inches of layout space for a port blade simplifying board design and reducing the number of layer s required RGMII is a reduced pin count interface that simplifies board design by lowering the number of interface pins from pins used in the G MII interface to It also lowers system cost compared to the older GMII or Ten Bit Interface TBI interfaces by reducing the number of layers requ ired to route highdensity networking solutions Using RGMII fewer pins ar e also required for the MACswitch ASICs lowering their cost To illustr ate RGMII saves pins in a port switch blade To achieve that the RGMII specification calls for a timing delay on the receive and transmit s ignals for each port Each timing delay must be implemented in a boardleve l trace These trace lengths are typically arranged in a spiral on the boar d that takes approximately one square inch of board space per trace Broadc oms alternative timing solution provides a DLLbased delay for the receive and transmit clocks thus eliminating the need for the timing delay traces Given the space requirement for each of the transmit and receive signal t iming delays on ports eliminating the timing delay traces can save s quare inches of layout space In addition to the RGMII interface the BCM also supports the RTBI interface which is a reduced pin count version of the TBI interface The BCM incorporates Broadcoms fourthgenerat ion Gigabit Ethernet transceiver technology implemented in the advanced micron process already proven in production in Broadcoms quadport BCM and used in BCM Gigabit Ethernet transceivers and the companys sing le port BCM copper and BCMS copperplusfiber transceivers Broadco ms Ethernet transceivers are the most widely deployed and fieldproven in the industry with over million Gigabit Ethernet ports and over milli on Fast Ethernet ports shipped to date The BCM is manufactured using t he advanced micron process technology developed by Taiwan Semiconducto r Manufacturing Company TSMC one of Broadcoms foundry partners Collabo ration between Broadcom and TSMC drawing on Broadcoms advanced communicat ions IC expertise and TSMCs process technology knowledge led to a broad f amily of mixed signal devices that achieve superior performance lower cost and slash power requirements by percent The BCM incorporates all three Ethernet speeds and Megabits per second Mbps w ith standardsbased autonegotiation to ensure compatibility with all exis ting Ethernet network equipment operating over legacy Category copper cab le plants Unique irespeedTM technology enables equipment manuf actured using the BCM to autonegotiate to the maximum speed possible o ver an impaired cable plant regardless of the maximum speed advertised by the endequipment The BCM incorporates the industrys most powerful transceiver DSP engine delivering over one Teraop one trillion operations per second performance combined with highspeed precision mixedsignal circuits This processing power ensures robust operation at Gigabit speeds over the broadest range of existing cable plants In addition the BCM is designed to exceed the IEEE specifications for noise cancellation and tr ansmission jitter providing consistent and reliable operation even over ma rginal cable plants The BCMs cable diagnostic capability allows use rs IT managers and networking equipment manufacturers to remotely analyze the quality and attributes of the cable thereby avoiding unnecessary equip ment returns and service calls Builtin diagnostics help pinpoint the caus e of network malfunctions without deploying field support personnel or brin
