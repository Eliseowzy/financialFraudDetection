Chris Nerney Senior Analyst In May he predicted the company would be profitable within months With only five months to go it now looks like Ask Jeeves is falling somewhat short of CEO Robert Wrubels bold proclamation But Wrubel wont be at the helm when next May arrives for he is stepping down from the chief executives post and relinquishing his seat on the board of directors Many current Ask Jeeves employees also may find themselves in other jobs come May as heavy layoffs loom for the reddrenched natural language search portal and technology company None of which should be surprising to anyone looking beyond the prodigious hype that has accompanied the marketingsavvy firm for most of its brief existence Among those ignoring the warning signs for too long were the halfdozen or so analysts who rushed to downgrade ASKJ shares late last week after the company warned that fourthquarter losses already expected to be bad cents per share would be even worse cents per share Some had cut their ratings for Ask Jeeves earlier in the year though not enough while at least a couple First Union and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray each had rated ASKJ a strong buy by late July I wont have to lower my assessment of Ask Jeeves because Ive always been skeptical about the companys business model technology claims and longterm prospects even before its July ticker debut Since its moonshot IPO Ask Jeeves has consistently turned in quarterly reports showing deep operating losses and revenues that failed to justify the companys previously lofty valuation Shares reached absurd heights a year ago closing at on Nov and have been unraveling ever since After Thursdays Q warning ASKJ plunged to by early Friday afternoon a price that leaves the stock with a loss for the year Put that in the Macys Day parade and see if it floats The company insists it can make a profit by Q or a year from now Given the Q preview thats a tall order First softness in spending on online advertising is expected to continue through the first two quarters next year and perhaps beyond In fact fourthquarter sales are forecast to be about million less than the previous two quarters So Ask Jeeves may have trouble increasing revenues even as it tries to move further away from dependence on ad dollars and toward business services Net loss for Q is expected to be million or cents per share which may be worse than street estimates but still is a big improvement over Qs net loss of million or per share If a companys revenues are flat and its losing money theres only one way to erase the operating deficit Cut costs That might be accomplished in part through increased efficiencies However the traditional and surer method is an employee bloodletting Thats what Ask Jeeves will be looking forward to next year if its lucky If its notwell we all know the answer to that one GUINNESS FLIGHT internetcom TM INDEX FUND Access the Internet with the Guinness Flight internetcomTM Index Fund Created to

<6566581.1075857093909.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,listsupport@internet.com,2000-12-12 23:13:00,Morning Report for Wednesday December Morning Report December Bouncing On Bad News By Chris Nerney Internet ad services market leader DoubleClick wasnt the biggest gainer Tuesday among members of internetcoms Internet Stock Index that honor belonged to PSINet which soared after announcing another round of layoffs and on rumors that Sprint may be interested in buying the beleaguered access provider But the fact that DCLK gained at all after issuing a warning for Q after Mondays market close is almost shocking given the current bearish outlook for online advertising growth Surely no other Internet company is more vulnerable to a downturn in Web ad spending than DoubleClick whose business plan from Day One was based on becoming the premiere provider of services for companies advertising on the Internet DoubleClick certainly has achieved that goal but the company still has no profits to show for it And with concerns about the future of online advertising intensifying throughout the year as one Net firm after another lowered their adrevenue forecasts DCLK has become one of the biggest losers among largecap Net players Even with Tuesdays gain to DoubleClick is down this year So why the postwarning spike Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares already have been discounted enough With a market capitalization of billion DoubleClick is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Not a bad price for a company that dominates its sector Or it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClicks Q advisory which warned that revenues will be to below expectations and that the bottom line will range from breakeven to a net loss of cents per share While those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q estimates calling for a net profit of cents per share they hardly are indicative that the sky is falling on DoubleClick Yet It looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April for evidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit Until then dont expect many days like Tuesday for DCLK shares Getting back to PSINet its nearly gain or cents on Tuesday helped slash its yeartodate loss to from The layoff of workers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale In November PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options As a group

<16769198.1075857096656.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,listsupport@internet.com,2000-12-11 23:21:00,Morning Report for Tuesday December Morning Report December columnarticlehtml Cheap Tickets Cheap Shares By Chris Nerney Its an etailer that still derives most of its revenue from nonInternet sources which along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner might explain why it has gotten less publicity or notoriety than chief competitor pricelinecom But though Cheap Tickets may have no highprofile celebrity pitching its low air fares and hotel rooms the Hawaiibased company does have one thing for which pricelinecom and its investors would no doubt pay dearly profits In fact CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters the most recent Q showing net income of million or cents per share on revenues of million In contrast pricelinecom with much higher revenues of million in the third quarter turned in a loss of million or per share Last Thursday the troubled name your price etailer announced yet another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its services And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among Net stocks this year down through Mondays trading despite surging up after last weeks news Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about onethird since Dec closing Monday at Which could mean theres more downside coming for CTIX However the companys highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to prevent much more stockprice erosion With a market capitalization of million Cheap Tickets is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Thats the best revenuemultiple valuation Ive ever seen among profitable Internet companies Of course as mentioned earlier Cheap Tickets really isnt a pure Internet play Begun in the companys prime business which accounts for of sales is to purchase nonpublished air fares from the carriers and resell them at a discount to consumers Up until all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail outlets This changed in when CTIX launched its cheapticketscom Web site By last years third quarter of sales came via the Internet That increased to or million in the recent third quarter Further while Internetbased revenues are rising both on a dollar and percentage basis call center and retail revenues actually are declining on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web a strategy shift that has been accompanied by higher gross margins All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise Now heres why I dont expect them to rise too far The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth Sales in the recent third quarter were just above last years Q down from Qs yearoveryear revenue increase which was way below the increase in firstquarter sales Granted the increase in Internetbased revenue for Q was over the yearago period but even that number isnt eyecatching among Net investors Then theres the threat of competition including Hotwirecom a discount travel Web site startup that is being supported by a six major airlines Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in selling unsold and unpublished air fares a trend will put even more pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources With viable options for Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily basis Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look It is profitable and its shares affordable which bodes well should a larger player eventually scoop up the company MAKE WSRN YOUR SOURCE FOR WALL STREET RESEARCH WSRNcom is the

sponsored by internetcom Careers Channel No Way To Treat A Trader By Paul Shread mailto June The bottoming patterns weve been tracking in recent weeks on some leading technology and Internet stocks began to break down in this weeks sharp market selloff It may just be that these stocks have come too far too fast and need time to go back and regroup After all this has been one of the steepest rallies in US market history and some sort of pullback is to be expected But if the goal of a bear market rally is to fool as many people as possible into thinking that the bottom is in the way to do it would be with bullish chart patterns that then break down As weve been saying in the daily technical commentary on the Nasdaq and on the SP are our lines in the sand Below those levels a retest of the bottom is likely Above those levels and the market looks okay JOB SECURITY CAREER GROWTH CHALLENGING POSITIONS The internetcom Careers Channel is powered by dicecom the leading online Information

great job Dont wait any longer sectionscareershtml adv Well start with the one genuinely positive chart which is Microsoft NASDAQMSFT Mr Softie is hanging on nicely right under resistance A clean break of would be bullish that inverted head and shoulders pattern would give the stock longterm upside potential to A break below would be a negative The ugliest breakdown award goes to Juniper Networks NASDAQJNPR which took out support at the level of the shoulders of its inverted head and shoulders bottom and went all the way down to fill an island reversal gap at the arrow The stock needs to get back above and a clean break of would likely take it back to about Ciena NASDAQCIEN was another tough break for the bulls The only clear break of its neckline came on an inverted hammer see arrow in chart below which was a reversal candlestick showing a strong open and weak close The stock has since broken down further out of what appears to be a symmetrical triangle or rising channel the blue lines Openwave NASDAQOPWV was one of the most promising of the patterns a nice inverted head and shoulders bottom with a clear neckline But the stock gapped back below that neckline at two days ago The stock could probably go as low as without causing significant technical damage is now resistance again Network Appliance NASDAQNTAP has struggled around the important level for some time and finally broke down on Wednesday The stock held the level of its left shoulder but it now has one cycle of a lower high and lower low a negative Netegrity NASDAQNETE is still within the realm of a normal retracement but it needs to clear the level and stay there must hold if the stock gets that low CMGI NASDAQCMGI continues to hold above support a clean break of would likely carry the stock all the way back to the neckline at The one negative is the stock set a lower high recently And finally two examples of old economy stocks that held their breakouts nicely this week Tyco NYSETYC first chart below went back to fill a breakout gap at but bounced back to close above the neckline of an inverted head and shoulders bottom And United Technologies NYSEUTX second chart held above its recent breakout to a new alltime high Again the breakdowns among some leading technology stocks do not necessarily spell doom but the stocks and the major indexes should be watched for signs of further

the month at six points lower than where it began the month And the ISDEX dropped from its May peak of to close May at four points lower than where it traded on May Under the circumstances its not surprising that there were only three ISDEX stocks out of that ended May with price changes of greater than from where they began the month But the stock that topped the index in May was a surprise financial services applications firm S NASDAQSONE soared after topping earnings estimates and predicting that it will be in the black on an EBITDA basis by the end of the year The other two big ISDEX movers were to the downside Portal Software NASDAQPRSF plunged on an earnings warning and former highflyer Ariba NASDAQARBA lost on concern about the viability of its business model The number five loser in May was also a BB stock Commerce One NASDAQCMRC which dropped The struggles of Ariba and Commerce One make i Technologies NASDAQITWO gain last month worth noting Another surprise in May was that the bottom of the list was populated by stocks that until recently were or still are thought of as leaders Palm NASDAQPALM lost in May on an earnings warning but rebounded smartly Friday on management assertions that business is improving And Juniper Networks NASDAQJNPR one of the greatest performers in also lost in May as worries about the abysmal state of telecom equipment spending began to spread to the stocks whose fundamentals are still holding up On the upside resurgent GoTocom NASDAQGOTO came in second in May with a gain of On top of the stocks gain that led all ISDEX stocks in April the payperclick search service bears watching Rounding out the rest of the top five were takeover candidate Ameritrade NASDAQAMTD up Vignette NASDAQVIGN up on optimism over new products and positive analyst comments and eBay NASDAQEBAY up the one dotcom that has not only survived but thrived Finally a quick technical look at the ISDEX The index broke out of an inverse head and shoulders bottom on April see chart below at With a head at and a neckline at the index had points of upside potential which it exceeded by points at its peak To the downside is first support and

Paul Shread mailto June Its a long way from its alltime high but GoTocom did yesterday what few Net stocks have done lately it hit a new week high GoTos NASDAQGOTO close of and intraday high of exceeded its September intraday high of when the Nasdaq closed at Before that you have to go back to May to find a higher price on GOTO Its alltime high of was reached in November The reason for GoTos resurgence is simple the company is in the right place at the right time GoTos payperclick search service is suddenly in demand as search and portal sites look for alternatives to advertising Since

Disney Internet site it had once sued for having a logo a little too similar to its own But the Gocom win also symbolizes how risky GOTOs stock is The future of Gocom has been very much up in the air with Disney threatening to shut it down as recently as January A continued shakeout among search sites could bring GOTO stock back to earth But GoTo has also diversified into other areas The ChannelFusion online auction management program allows merchants to better manage their listings on eBay NASDAQEBAY one of the very few Net companies whose fortunes have been unaffected by the market shakeout Its interesting to note that eBay and GoTo have led the ISDEX higher since the April bottom But inevitably we have to mention valuation and GOTO stock is pricey indeed The company is expected to lose cents a share this year turn profitable by the end of the year and earn cents a share in That means the stock is trading at a pricetoearnings ratio of or twice the companys longterm projected growth rate The company could exceed those targets but keep a close eye on GOTO stock which can be volatile The September close of should now be support if this breakout is for real But in an

Shread mailto June If any single Net company has the potential to be a longterm winner it is eBay It has a hugely dominant market position making it very difficult for competitors to challenge it It has one of only four genuine Internet brands the others being Yahoo Amazon and AOL Establishing a genuine brand that conjures up an image in the publics mind is one of the toughest things to do in business and probably even tougher on the Internet because no one strolls by your storefront everyday or sees your product in the display case Customers have to find you or you have to find them Having a brand name that people remember when theyre looking for something is a huge advantage on the Internet And unlike Yahoo NASDAQYHOO and Amazon NASDAQAMZN whose fundamentals have come unglued over the last year eBay NASDAQEBAY hasnt missed a beat It has even held up better than AOL NYSEAOL which is no longer a pure Internet company anyway due to its merger with Time Warner which in retrospect may have been a good move for shareholders eBay has also become something of a BB company particularly in these difficult times which also gives it some countercyclical strength For example the number of Cisco NASDAQCSCO items for sale on eBay has grown by in the last month to about items a good indicator of the state of Ciscos business It will be interesting to see what happens to eBays

times earnings estimates of cents a share It has a projected twoyear growth rate of Using the PEG ratio pricetoearnings growth ratio times gives eBay a fair value of a share Admittedly eBay will likely top those estimates But as weve seen over the last year if you overpay for a stock you usually lose money in the long run That said we last wrote about eBay on April when it was trading for a share a wild day for eBays stock that turned out to be a shortterm top We said it was overvalued then and it did dip as low as in the subsequent pullback but it never pulled back into a range where it became a reasonable longterm investment which is what the PEG ratio helps determine eBays chart however looks like it may not provide longterm investors with a buying opportunity in the near future see chart below Unlike the Nasdaq eBay has broken its main bear market downtrend line and put in a credible doublebottom to boot That range should now be support and we cant find a whole lot of upside

Shread mailto June The most significant statement to come from the Federal Reserve in recent months came not from Chairman Alan Greenspan but from Fed Governor Laurence Meyer who yesterday expressed doubt that a secondhalf economic recovery will occur While a recovery along the lines of the consensus forecast is reasonable I see some downside risks to that outlook Meyer said in a New York speech There are no signs yet that the economy is strengthening relative to its firstquarter performance and growth is likely to remain sluggish into the third quarter An assessment that blunt from a Fed official is rare Coming from Meyer it amounts to a seachange in the Feds view of the economy and investors should take notice Meyers influence on the Fed trails only that of Greenspans He is the unacknowledged leader of the Feds hawkish wing and is believed to be one of the primary reasons that the Fed took so long to begin cutting interest rates What is doubly surprising about yesterdays speech is that Meyer actually softened his tone on inflation With productivity suffering its worst drop in eight years you would think an inflation hawk like Meyer would be alarmed But because the slowdown started from a relatively low level of inflation the desirability of a significant decrease in inflation rates is not as great as it has been in the past he said In other words there is no push from the Feds hawks to shift bias or end the ratecutting cycle anytime soon For one of the Feds most hawkish members to be more worried about the economy than inflation after basis points in rate cuts speaks volumes about the risks to the economy Meyer even admitted that his inflationfighting bias may have been overdone Some including myself may have overweighted our concerns over resource utilization rates during the highgrowth period but underestimated the dangers from growing imbalances in other areas The absence of the emergence of inflationary pressures and therefore of a rise in real interest rates to contain them may have contributed to an environment in which asset bubbles and real investment excesses could develop And that last sentence is why Fed rate cuts may not do much to help this time Overinvestment takes time to work off If the problem is that businesses and individuals took on too much debt and overbuilt or overspent on the assumption that the economy and the stock market would grow indefinitely then easy credit in the form of lower interest rates isnt going to help much The recovery depends on business inventories being reduced and investment in productivityenhancing technologies and new economy opportunities rebounding Meyer said But he also said the memory of last year could restrain investment for some time All of this may not have been preventable but we would argue that the Fed should have seen it coming sooner Heres a quote from the August edition of our Market Close Recession indicator shortterm treasury bond yields rose above year bond yields last week and have stayed there since Over the last years this phenomenon occurring for two consecutive months has presaged a recession within six months of the time Shortterm yields are now threatening to rise above year yields if they do the yield curve inversion will be complete There are positive factors behind the inversion such as the governments buyback of longterm bonds due to the federal budget surplus but it is nonetheless worth keeping an eye on The indicator gave a firm signal in October about the same time that GE CEO Jack Welch reportedly told Alan Greenspan that he was seeing worrisome signs in the economy The Fed didnt begin cutting rates until almost three months later We felt compelled to mention the positive aspects of the yield curve inversion last August only because the consensus since the inversion began in January was that it was a good thing Those same economists are now predicting a secondhalf recovery for the economy We wont have to wait long to find out if theyre right but its significant that the leader of the Feds hawkish faction has his doubts Disclaimer Neither internetcom nor the writers of this newsletter makes specific trading

<19209790.1075857107415.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,listsupport@internet.com,2000-12-12 23:13:00,Morning Report for Wednesday December Morning Report December Bouncing On Bad News By Chris Nerney Internet ad services market leader DoubleClick wasnt the biggest gainer Tuesday among members of internetcoms Internet Stock Index that honor belonged to PSINet which soared after announcing another round of layoffs and on rumors that Sprint may be interested in buying the beleaguered access provider But the fact that DCLK gained at all after issuing a warning for Q after Mondays market close is almost shocking given the current bearish outlook for online advertising growth Surely no other Internet company is more vulnerable to a downturn in Web ad spending than DoubleClick whose business plan from Day One was based on becoming the premiere provider of services for companies advertising on the Internet DoubleClick certainly has achieved that goal but the company still has no profits to show for it And with concerns about the future of online advertising intensifying throughout the year as one Net firm after another lowered their adrevenue forecasts DCLK has become one of the biggest losers among largecap Net players Even with Tuesdays gain to DoubleClick is down this year So why the postwarning spike Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares already have been discounted enough With a market capitalization of billion DoubleClick is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Not a bad price for a company that dominates its sector Or it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClicks Q advisory which warned that revenues will be to below expectations and that the bottom line will range from breakeven to a net loss of cents per share While those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q estimates calling for a net profit of cents per share they hardly are indicative that the sky is falling on DoubleClick Yet It looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April for evidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit Until then dont expect many days like Tuesday for DCLK shares Getting back to PSINet its nearly gain or cents on Tuesday helped slash its yeartodate loss to from The layoff of workers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale In November PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options As a group

Chris Nerney Senior Analyst In May he predicted the company would be profitable within months With only five months to go it now looks like Ask Jeeves is falling somewhat short of CEO Robert Wrubels bold proclamation But Wrubel wont be at the helm when next May arrives for he is stepping down from the chief executives post and relinquishing his seat on the board of directors Many current Ask Jeeves employees also may find themselves in other jobs come May as heavy layoffs loom for the reddrenched natural language search portal and technology company None of which should be surprising to anyone looking beyond the prodigious hype that has accompanied the marketingsavvy firm for most of its brief existence Among those ignoring the warning signs for too long were the halfdozen or so analysts who rushed to downgrade ASKJ shares late last week after the company warned that fourthquarter losses already expected to be bad cents per share would be even worse cents per share Some had cut their ratings for Ask Jeeves earlier in the year though not enough while at least a couple First Union and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray each had rated ASKJ a strong buy by late July I wont have to lower my assessment of Ask Jeeves because Ive always been skeptical about the companys business model technology claims and longterm prospects even before its July ticker debut Since its moonshot IPO Ask Jeeves has consistently turned in quarterly reports showing deep operating losses and revenues that failed to justify the companys previously lofty valuation Shares reached absurd heights a year ago closing at on Nov and have been unraveling ever since After Thursdays Q warning ASKJ plunged to by early Friday afternoon a price that leaves the stock with a loss for the year Put that in the Macys Day parade and see if it floats The company insists it can make a profit by Q or a year from now Given the Q preview thats a tall order First softness in spending on online advertising is expected to continue through the first two quarters next year and perhaps beyond In fact fourthquarter sales are forecast to be about million less than the previous two quarters So Ask Jeeves may have trouble increasing revenues even as it tries to move further away from dependence on ad dollars and toward business services Net loss for Q is expected to be million or cents per share which may be worse than street estimates but still is a big improvement over Qs net loss of million or per share If a companys revenues are flat and its losing money theres only one way to erase the operating deficit Cut costs That might be accomplished in part through increased efficiencies However the traditional and surer method is an employee bloodletting Thats what Ask Jeeves will be looking forward to next year if its lucky If its notwell we all know the answer to that one GUINNESS FLIGHT internetcom TM INDEX FUND Access the Internet with the Guinness Flight internetcomTM Index Fund Created to

Chris Nerney Its an etailer that still derives most of its revenue from nonInternet sources which along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner might explain why it has gotten less publicity or notoriety than chief competitor pricelinecom But though Cheap Tickets may have no highprofile celebrity pitching its low air fares and hotel rooms the Hawaiibased company does have one thing for which pricelinecom and its investors would no doubt pay dearly profits In fact CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters the most recent Q showing net income of million or cents per share on revenues of million In contrast pricelinecom with much higher revenues of million in the third quarter turned in a loss of million or per share Last Thursday the troubled name your price etailer announced yet another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its services And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among Net stocks this year down through Mondays trading despite surging up after last weeks news Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about onethird since Dec closing Monday at Which could mean theres more downside coming for CTIX However the companys highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to prevent much more stockprice erosion With a market capitalization of million Cheap Tickets is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Thats the best revenuemultiple valuation Ive ever seen among profitable Internet companies Of course as mentioned earlier Cheap Tickets really isnt a pure Internet play Begun in the companys prime business which accounts for of sales is to purchase nonpublished air fares from the carriers and resell them at a discount to consumers Up until all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail outlets This changed in when CTIX launched its cheapticketscom Web site By last years third quarter of sales came via the Internet That increased to or million in the recent third quarter Further while Internetbased revenues are rising both on a dollar and percentage basis call center and retail revenues actually are declining on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web a strategy shift that has been accompanied by higher gross margins All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise Now heres why I dont expect them to rise too far The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth Sales in the recent third quarter were just above last years Q down from Qs yearoveryear revenue increase which was way below the increase in firstquarter sales Granted the increase in Internetbased revenue for Q was over the yearago period but even that number isnt eyecatching among Net investors Then theres the threat of competition including Hotwirecom a discount travel Web site startup that is being supported by a six major airlines Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in selling unsold and unpublished air fares a trend will put even more pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources With viable options for Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily basis Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look It is profitable and its shares affordable which bodes well should a larger player eventually scoop up the company MAKE WSRN YOUR SOURCE FOR WALL STREET RESEARCH WSRNcom is the

Tales By Paul Shread mailto June Yesterdays lack of an earnings warning from Intel NASDAQJNPR was good news but this mornings warning from Juniper Networks NASDAQJNPR was anything but And the news from both companies underscores just how tough the current environment is After months of not being able to lower guidance fast enough Intel gave guidance on April that is still holding up seven weeks later But lets not turn handstands over the news There were more negatives than positives in Intels firstever midquarter update For starters its one thing for business to stabilize Its quite another for it to turn up and Intel pointedly avoided providing any guidance beyond the June quarter except that to say that it expects a seasonally strong second half Intel said it sees stability in the microprocessor business although the company expects inventory to be up somewhat over the March quarter But it continues to see weakness in the communications business and Juniper drove that point home with an exclamation mark this morning Juniper said it sees earnings of cents a share this quarter well below estimates of cent earnings Revenue guidance was lowered from million to million For a genuine leader like Juniper thats a huge warning The company also announced layoffs Juniper cited a challenging service provider and global carrier business environment brought about by a capacity absorption cycle taking place currently throughout the industry In other words all those nextgeneration service providers CLECs and longdistance carriers that have sprung up in recent years are undergoing a shakeout of their own and all the equipment companies that have sprung up to serve them are suddenly seeing business drop out from underneath them This is not something that Federal Reserve rate cuts are likely to help and its likely to affect everyone from shareholders to employees to venture capitalists Oddly this is probably worse news for Ciena NASDAQCIEN which is now the only telecom equipment company whose earnings are still holding up than it is for Cisco NASDAQCSCO Junipers chief competitor in the router business Cisco focuses more on the enterprise market while Ciena has substantial carrier exposure It will be interesting to see if demand for Cienas optical equipment can withstand a shakeout in the carrier business which the Juniper warning signals is clearly underway The news could also weigh on Avici NASDAQAVCI which is focused almost entirely on the carrier market Have a FLASH Product or Service to Sell The FlashKit Classifieds provide a unique opportunity for you to reach millions of visitors per month Only for days Check it out today adv The Juniper and Intel news made for some interesting technical developments in the aftermarket and premarket trading sessions Intel had cleared resistance after its conference call but dropped back below that level on the Juniper news And Juniper fell points to support below that level the next support is in the range From a valuation standpoint neither stock is a screaming buy at these levels Intel is trading at times this years expected earnings which are predicted to fall And it is trading at times estimated earnings which are expected to be half what the company earned in For a company with an expected longterm growth rate of that is one expensive stock And well have to wait to see how far Junipers estimates come down before we can calculate a new fair value for that one But more and more telecom equipment stocks are beginning to look like a story Disclaimer Neither

could be forming either bearish rising wedges the black lines or head and shoulders tops the blue lines Our best guess is that theyre rising wedges and that those upper trendlines will be reached in the nearterm but thats just a guess based on the surprising strength in the market However at least one cycle watcher is expecting a significant peak in the June June timeframe Those patterns make on the Nasdaq and on the Nasdaq important support A look at two possible outcomes the Nasdaq s bearish rising wedge rally of last summer third chart and the Dows bullish negation of a rising wedge at in

Chris Nerney Senior Analyst In May he predicted the company would be profitable within months With only five months to go it now looks like Ask Jeeves is falling somewhat short of CEO Robert Wrubels bold proclamation But Wrubel wont be at the helm when next May arrives for he is stepping down from the chief executives post and relinquishing his seat on the board of directors Many current Ask Jeeves employees also may find themselves in other jobs come May as heavy layoffs loom for the reddrenched natural language search portal and technology company None of which should be surprising to anyone looking beyond the prodigious hype that has accompanied the marketingsavvy firm for most of its brief existence Among those ignoring the warning signs for too long were the halfdozen or so analysts who rushed to downgrade ASKJ shares late last week after the company warned that fourthquarter losses already expected to be bad cents per share would be even worse cents per share Some had cut their ratings for Ask Jeeves earlier in the year though not enough while at least a couple First Union and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray each had rated ASKJ a strong buy by late July I wont have to lower my assessment of Ask Jeeves because Ive always been skeptical about the companys business model technology claims and longterm prospects even before its July ticker debut Since its moonshot IPO Ask Jeeves has consistently turned in quarterly reports showing deep operating losses and revenues that failed to justify the companys previously lofty valuation Shares reached absurd heights a year ago closing at on Nov and have been unraveling ever since After Thursdays Q warning ASKJ plunged to by early Friday afternoon a price that leaves the stock with a loss for the year Put that in the Macys Day parade and see if it floats The company insists it can make a profit by Q or a year from now Given the Q preview thats a tall order First softness in spending on online advertising is expected to continue through the first two quarters next year and perhaps beyond In fact fourthquarter sales are forecast to be about million less than the previous two quarters So Ask Jeeves may have trouble increasing revenues even as it tries to move further away from dependence on ad dollars and toward business services Net loss for Q is expected to be million or cents per share which may be worse than street estimates but still is a big improvement over Qs net loss of million or per share If a companys revenues are flat and its losing money theres only one way to erase the operating deficit Cut costs That might be accomplished in part through increased efficiencies However the traditional and surer method is an employee bloodletting Thats what Ask Jeeves will be looking forward to next year if its lucky If its notwell we all know the answer to that one GUINNESS FLIGHT internetcom TM INDEX FUND Access the Internet with the Guinness Flight internetcomTM Index Fund Created to

<18492068.1075857110950.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,listsupport@internet.com,2000-12-12 23:13:00,Morning Report for Wednesday December Morning Report December Bouncing On Bad News By Chris Nerney Internet ad services market leader DoubleClick wasnt the biggest gainer Tuesday among members of internetcoms Internet Stock Index that honor belonged to PSINet which soared after announcing another round of layoffs and on rumors that Sprint may be interested in buying the beleaguered access provider But the fact that DCLK gained at all after issuing a warning for Q after Mondays market close is almost shocking given the current bearish outlook for online advertising growth Surely no other Internet company is more vulnerable to a downturn in Web ad spending than DoubleClick whose business plan from Day One was based on becoming the premiere provider of services for companies advertising on the Internet DoubleClick certainly has achieved that goal but the company still has no profits to show for it And with concerns about the future of online advertising intensifying throughout the year as one Net firm after another lowered their adrevenue forecasts DCLK has become one of the biggest losers among largecap Net players Even with Tuesdays gain to DoubleClick is down this year So why the postwarning spike Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares already have been discounted enough With a market capitalization of billion DoubleClick is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Not a bad price for a company that dominates its sector Or it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClicks Q advisory which warned that revenues will be to below expectations and that the bottom line will range from breakeven to a net loss of cents per share While those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q estimates calling for a net profit of cents per share they hardly are indicative that the sky is falling on DoubleClick Yet It looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April for evidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit Until then dont expect many days like Tuesday for DCLK shares Getting back to PSINet its nearly gain or cents on Tuesday helped slash its yeartodate loss to from The layoff of workers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale In November PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic options As a group

<15762640.1075857113703.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,listsupport@internet.com,2000-12-11 23:21:00,Morning Report for Tuesday December Morning Report December columnarticlehtml Cheap Tickets Cheap Shares By Chris Nerney Its an etailer that still derives most of its revenue from nonInternet sources which along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner might explain why it has gotten less publicity or notoriety than chief competitor pricelinecom But though Cheap Tickets may have no highprofile celebrity pitching its low air fares and hotel rooms the Hawaiibased company does have one thing for which pricelinecom and its investors would no doubt pay dearly profits In fact CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters the most recent Q showing net income of million or cents per share on revenues of million In contrast pricelinecom with much higher revenues of million in the third quarter turned in a loss of million or per share Last Thursday the troubled name your price etailer announced yet another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its services And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among Net stocks this year down through Mondays trading despite surging up after last weeks news Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about onethird since Dec closing Monday at Which could mean theres more downside coming for CTIX However the companys highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to prevent much more stockprice erosion With a market capitalization of million Cheap Tickets is valued at x trailing months revenue of million Thats the best revenuemultiple valuation Ive ever seen among profitable Internet companies Of course as mentioned earlier Cheap Tickets really isnt a pure Internet play Begun in the companys prime business which accounts for of sales is to purchase nonpublished air fares from the carriers and resell them at a discount to consumers Up until all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail outlets This changed in when CTIX launched its cheapticketscom Web site By last years third quarter of sales came via the Internet That increased to or million in the recent third quarter Further while Internetbased revenues are rising both on a dollar and percentage basis call center and retail revenues actually are declining on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web a strategy shift that has been accompanied by higher gross margins All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise Now heres why I dont expect them to rise too far The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth Sales in the recent third quarter were just above last years Q down from Qs yearoveryear revenue increase which was way below the increase in firstquarter sales Granted the increase in Internetbased revenue for Q was over the yearago period but even that number isnt eyecatching among Net investors Then theres the threat of competition including Hotwirecom a discount travel Web site startup that is being supported by a six major airlines Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in selling unsold and unpublished air fares a trend will put even more pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources With viable options for Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily basis Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look It is profitable and its shares affordable which bodes well should a larger player eventually scoop up the company MAKE WSRN YOUR SOURCE FOR WALL STREET RESEARCH WSRNcom is the
