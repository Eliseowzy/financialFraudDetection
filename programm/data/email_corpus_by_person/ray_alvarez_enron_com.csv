On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing longterm supply contracts Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance o n them according to the Andersen survey The full Andersen report on the Western energy crisis can be downloaded at wwwandersencom ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California Power virus Andersen analysis WASHINGTON DC April A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro w if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat e regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent pruden ce review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator y risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliabil ity and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make n ew investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases a nd demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions ha ve longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerte rm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and souther n markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading an d marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests In addition limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a criti cal valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potentia l of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemerge nce of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The surve y conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarg et for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states wil l review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California s current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models o r strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are awar e of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompte d retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RT O deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster thei r basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply wi ll better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In additi on to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decision s in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortage s companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimprovi ng upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the company s future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industr y nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal David O Jermain Simplify market design Build a continuing role for regulators Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions Couple realtime retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition Provide special incentives for RTO investment formation and development Break down regulatory and political barriers to market

<32737555.1075847616506.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-03-23 09:11:00,Re Supreme Decree Cc Our team has been working on the supreme decree for over two years and it is gratifying to finally bring this in given that it will have a significant financial benefit for EnronTransredes I have included an executive summary and detailed report below Executive Summary Through the efforts of the Transredes regulatory team A presidential Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for Bolivian gas transportation has issued and gone into effect The recovery mechanism we proposed will allow Transredes to recover over US million which was at risk This amount residing in the gas deferr ed account will be recovered over years instead of under the former regulations and will take the form of a surcharge on all gas transported b y any pipeline in Bolivia instead of being assessed only on Transredes transport volumes as per the former regulations In the future Transredes will be able to fully recover all of its prudentl y incurred costs and the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export gas concession The mechanism advanced by government to subsidize the transportation tariff of the domestic gas concession in the future will in all likelihood allow Transredes to receive the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarb on Law although the mechanism needs to be fleshed out further The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case financing prog ram and pending bond issue to move forward Detailed Report This is a significant development in the Bolivian regulatory arena The Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for natural gas transportation in Bolivia was signed by President Banzer and was published in the official gazette on Wednesday We officially learned about it yesterday upon receipt of a certified copy The new methodology and regulations are now in effect The decree provides for full recovery of Transredes gas deferred account over the next twenty years via a surcharge on ALL volumes exported from Bolivia whether transported by Transredes or not The magnitude of the ga s deferred account is much greater than anticipated due primarily to severe export shortfalls as compared to projected export volumes This is due in large part to delays in the development of the Brazilian market and to expiration of gas sales and export agreements between Bolivia and Argentina in Please see the attached graph comparing the volumes projected by the Bolivian government to set transitory tariffs prior to privatization with the actual volumes transported The gas deferred account is estimated to be approximately US million plus approximately US MM for the hydrocarbon liquids deferred account giving a total of USMM Please see attached Gas Deferred Account and Total Deferred Account graphs These amounts represent the shortfall in revenues experienced due to insufficiently high transitory tariffs plus th e cost of capital at The recovery mechanism for the gas deferred account represents the mitigati on of a significant exposure that existed at the time we acquired the company the transportation concessions are nonexclusive and producers have the explicit right in the Hydrocarbon Law to build their own bypass pipelines yet the deferred account recovery mechanism placed the burden of recovery solely on the transportation tariffs of Transredes The change in regulations not only secures recovery of these amounts in a commercially viable manner but will disincentivize threatened bypasses In the future Transredes will also be able to fully recover all of its prudently incurred costs and rate of return via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export g as concession We believe that the tariff mechanism for the domestic gas concession may require additional detail work The mechanism provides for a ceiling rate of US for transportation in the domestic concession and a surcharge on all export volumes of US These tariff components will no t be sufficient to recover the costs and rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law to be recovered by Transredes However there appears to b e no impediment to collecting the revenue shortfall in the Transredes export gas tariff The regulatory team will continue trying to firm up this mechanism The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case to move forward The rate case filing made in late January kicked off a process that will culminate in the approval of new economic rates to be effective on May The decree and rate case filing will also allow the Transredes financing program and pending bond issue to move forward These have been stalled fo r months due to lender doubts and uncertainty about rates and recovery of the deferred account Richard Shapiro PM To Ray NRON cc Steven J nron James D nron Subject Re Supreme Decree Congrats Ray Alvarez PM To Richard nron cc Subject Supreme Decree Rick I heard from my Bolivia regulatory team that the supreme decree is a reality and that it is very positive including full recovery of the MM gas deferred account that we were hanging out on I will provide more details as soon as I receive them Ray

distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing longterm supply contracts Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance o n them according to the Andersen survey The full Andersen report on the Western energy crisis can be downloaded at wwwandersencom ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California Power virus Andersen analysis WASHINGTON DC April A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro w if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat e regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent pruden ce review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator y risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing

and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the

contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a criti cal valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potentia l of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemerge nce of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The surve y conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarg et for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states wil l review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California s current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models o r strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are awar e of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompte d retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RT O deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster thei r basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply wi ll better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In additi on to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decision s in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortage s companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimprovi ng upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the company s future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industr y nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal David O Jermain Simplify market design Build a continuing role for regulators Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions Couple

finally bring this in given that it will have a significant financial benefit for EnronTransredes I have included an executive summary and detailed report below Executive Summary Through the efforts of the Transredes regulatory team A presidential Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for Bolivian gas transportation has issued and gone into effect The recovery mechanism we proposed will allow Transredes to recover over US million which was at risk This amount residing in the gas deferr ed account will be recovered over years instead of under the former regulations and will take the form of a surcharge on all gas transported b y any pipeline in Bolivia instead of being assessed only on Transredes transport volumes as per the former regulations In the future Transredes will be able to fully recover all of its prudentl y incurred costs and the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export gas concession The mechanism advanced by government to subsidize the transportation tariff of the domestic gas concession in the future will in all likelihood allow Transredes to receive the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarb on Law although the mechanism needs to be fleshed out further The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case financing prog ram and pending bond issue to move forward Detailed Report This is a significant development in the Bolivian regulatory arena The Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for natural gas transportation in Bolivia was signed by President Banzer and was published in the official gazette on Wednesday We officially learned about it yesterday upon receipt of a certified copy The new methodology and regulations are now in effect The decree provides for full recovery of Transredes gas deferred account over the next twenty years via a surcharge on ALL volumes exported from Bolivia whether transported by Transredes or not The magnitude of the ga s deferred account is much greater than anticipated due primarily to severe export shortfalls as compared to projected export volumes This is due in large part to delays in the development of the Brazilian market and to expiration of gas sales and export agreements between Bolivia and Argentina in Please see the attached graph comparing the volumes projected by the Bolivian government to set transitory tariffs prior to privatization with the actual volumes transported The gas deferred account is estimated to be approximately US million plus approximately US MM for the hydrocarbon liquids deferred account giving a total of USMM Please see attached Gas Deferred Account and Total Deferred Account graphs These amounts represent the shortfall in revenues experienced due to insufficiently high transitory tariffs plus th e cost of capital at The recovery mechanism for the gas deferred account represents the mitigati on of a significant exposure that existed at the time we acquired the company the transportation concessions are nonexclusive and producers have the explicit right in the Hydrocarbon Law to build their own bypass pipelines yet the deferred account recovery mechanism placed the burden of recovery solely on the transportation tariffs of Transredes The change in regulations not only secures recovery of these amounts in a commercially viable manner but will disincentivize threatened bypasses In the future Transredes will also be able to fully recover all of its prudently incurred costs and rate of return via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export g as concession We believe that the tariff mechanism for the domestic gas concession may require additional detail work The mechanism provides for a ceiling rate of US for transportation in the domestic concession and a surcharge on all export volumes of US These tariff components will no t be sufficient to recover the costs and rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law to be recovered by Transredes However there appears to b e no impediment to collecting the revenue shortfall in the Transredes export gas tariff The regulatory team will continue trying to firm up this mechanism The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case to move forward The rate case filing made in late January kicked off a process that will culminate in the approval of new economic rates to be effective on May The decree and rate case filing will also allow the Transredes financing program and pending bond issue to move forward These have been stalled fo r months due to lender doubts and uncertainty about rates and recovery of the deferred account Richard

the CA team is the Andersen repo rt Energy Crisis in the Western US Reproduced below is a related article and that is followed by the text of the Andersen press release on the report Ray NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published April Andersen Warns Of Increased StateFederal Tensions The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasi ng over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets according to a new report issued Tuesday by Andersen The report Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields was unveiled by Andersens North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington DC briefing David Jermain principal with Andersens North American Energy Consultin g Practice noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis These aspects of the California virus will shape the longerterm operations of the Western grid the region al and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution he added The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Reduced investor confidence Contributing factor in economic softening Increased pressure on the Western grid Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage an d Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have been facing Jermain said If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question emerges namely whether state regulators will passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should occur Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition Jermain stated As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Wester n grid Jermain noted that Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western grid Such implications include a realistic chance that California could become an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a according to the Andersen report Also there could be increased emphasis o n security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have difficulties Along with yesterdays report Andersen also issued the results of an Andersen survey of senior executives from nonCalifornia utilities detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis fo r their companies and the industry The survey was conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation

finally bring this in given that it will have a significant financial benefit for EnronTransredes I have included an executive summary and detailed report below Executive Summary Through the efforts of the Transredes regulatory team A presidential Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for Bolivian gas transportation has issued and gone into effect The recovery mechanism we proposed will allow Transredes to recover over US million which was at risk This amount residing in the gas deferr ed account will be recovered over years instead of under the former regulations and will take the form of a surcharge on all gas transported b y any pipeline in Bolivia instead of being assessed only on Transredes transport volumes as per the former regulations In the future Transredes will be able to fully recover all of its prudentl y incurred costs and the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export gas concession The mechanism advanced by government to subsidize the transportation tariff of the domestic gas concession in the future will in all likelihood allow Transredes to receive the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarb on Law although the mechanism needs to be fleshed out further The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case financing prog ram and pending bond issue to move forward Detailed Report This is a significant development in the Bolivian regulatory arena The Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for natural gas transportation in Bolivia was signed by President Banzer and was published in the official gazette on Wednesday We officially learned about it yesterday upon receipt of a certified copy The new methodology and regulations are now in effect The decree provides for full recovery of Transredes gas deferred account over the next twenty years via a surcharge on ALL volumes exported from Bolivia whether transported by Transredes or not The magnitude of the ga s deferred account is much greater than anticipated due primarily to severe export shortfalls as compared to projected export volumes This is due in large part to delays in the development of the Brazilian market and to expiration of gas sales and export agreements between Bolivia and Argentina in Please see the attached graph comparing the volumes projected by the Bolivian government to set transitory tariffs prior to privatization with the actual volumes transported The gas deferred account is estimated to be approximately US million plus approximately US MM for the hydrocarbon liquids deferred account giving a total of USMM Please see attached Gas Deferred Account and Total Deferred Account graphs These amounts represent the shortfall in revenues experienced due to insufficiently high transitory tariffs plus th e cost of capital at The recovery mechanism for the gas deferred account represents the mitigati on of a significant exposure that existed at the time we acquired the company the transportation concessions are nonexclusive and producers have the explicit right in the Hydrocarbon Law to build their own bypass pipelines yet the deferred account recovery mechanism placed the burden of recovery solely on the transportation tariffs of Transredes The change in regulations not only secures recovery of these amounts in a commercially viable manner but will disincentivize threatened bypasses In the future Transredes will also be able to fully recover all of its prudently incurred costs and rate of return via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export g as concession We believe that the tariff mechanism for the domestic gas concession may require additional detail work The mechanism provides for a ceiling rate of US for transportation in the domestic concession and a surcharge on all export volumes of US These tariff components will no t be sufficient to recover the costs and rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law to be recovered by Transredes However there appears to b e no impediment to collecting the revenue shortfall in the Transredes export gas tariff The regulatory team will continue trying to firm up this mechanism The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case to move forward The rate case filing made in late January kicked off a process that will culminate in the approval of new economic rates to be effective on May The decree and rate case filing will also allow the Transredes financing program and pending bond issue to move forward These have been stalled fo r months due to lender doubts and uncertainty about rates and recovery of the deferred account Richard Shapiro PM To Ray NRON cc Steven J nron James D nron Subject Re Supreme Decree Congrats Ray Alvarez PM To Richard nron cc Subject Supreme Decree Rick I heard from my Bolivia regulatory team that the supreme decree is a reality and that it is very positive including full recovery of the MM gas deferred account that we were hanging out on I will provide more details as soon as I receive them Ray

Tuesday by Andersen The report Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields was unveiled by Andersens North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington DC briefing David Jermain principal with Andersens North American Energy Consultin g Practice noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis These aspects of the California virus will shape the longerterm operations of the Western grid the region al and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution he added The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Reduced investor confidence Contributing factor in economic softening Increased pressure

namely whether state regulators will passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should occur Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition Jermain stated As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Wester n grid Jermain noted that Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western grid Such implications include a realistic chance that California could become an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a according to the Andersen report Also there could be increased emphasis o n security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have difficulties Along with yesterdays report Andersen also issued the results of an Andersen survey of senior executives from nonCalifornia utilities detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis fo r their companies and the industry The survey was conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started

formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the

delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into

triggered a reemerge nce of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The surve y conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarg et for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will

the CA team is the Andersen repo rt Energy Crisis in the Western US Reproduced below is a related article and that is followed by the text of the Andersen press release on the report Ray NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published April Andersen Warns Of Increased StateFederal Tensions The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasi ng over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets according to a new report issued Tuesday by Andersen The report Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields was unveiled by Andersens North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington DC briefing David Jermain principal with Andersens North American Energy Consultin g Practice noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis These aspects of the California virus will shape the longerterm operations of the Western grid the region al and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution he added The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Reduced investor confidence Contributing factor in economic softening Increased pressure on the Western grid Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage an d Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have been facing Jermain said If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question emerges namely whether state regulators will passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should occur Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition Jermain stated As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Wester n grid Jermain noted that Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western grid Such implications include a realistic chance that California could become an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a according to the Andersen report Also there could be increased emphasis o n security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have difficulties Along with yesterdays report Andersen also issued the results of an Andersen survey of senior executives from nonCalifornia utilities detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis fo r their companies and the industry The survey was conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing longterm supply contracts Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance o n them according to the Andersen survey The full Andersen report on the Western energy crisis can be downloaded at wwwandersencom ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California Power virus Andersen analysis WASHINGTON DC April A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro w if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat e regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent pruden ce review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator y risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliabil ity and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make n ew investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases a nd demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions ha ve longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerte rm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and souther n markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading an d marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the

<28417702.1075848280415.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-03-23 09:11:00,Re Supreme Decree Cc Our team has been working on the supreme decree for over two years and it is gratifying to finally bring this in given that it will have a significant financial benefit for EnronTransredes I have included an executive summary and detailed report below Executive Summary Through the efforts of the Transredes regulatory team A presidential Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for Bolivian gas transportation has issued and gone into effect The recovery mechanism we proposed will allow Transredes to recover over US million which was at risk This amount residing in the gas deferr ed account will be recovered over years instead of under the former regulations and will take the form of a surcharge on all gas transported b y any pipeline in Bolivia instead of being assessed only on Transredes transport volumes as per the former regulations In the future Transredes will be able to fully recover all of its prudentl y incurred costs and the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export gas concession The mechanism advanced by government to subsidize the transportation tariff of the domestic gas concession in the future will in all likelihood allow Transredes to receive the full rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarb on Law although the mechanism needs to be fleshed out further The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case financing prog ram and pending bond issue to move forward Detailed Report This is a significant development in the Bolivian regulatory arena The Supreme Decree establishing a new tariff methodology for natural gas transportation in Bolivia was signed by President Banzer and was published in the official gazette on Wednesday We officially learned about it yesterday upon receipt of a certified copy The new methodology and regulations are now in effect The decree provides for full recovery of Transredes gas deferred account over the next twenty years via a surcharge on ALL volumes exported from Bolivia whether transported by Transredes or not The magnitude of the ga s deferred account is much greater than anticipated due primarily to severe export shortfalls as compared to projected export volumes This is due in large part to delays in the development of the Brazilian market and to expiration of gas sales and export agreements between Bolivia and Argentina in Please see the attached graph comparing the volumes projected by the Bolivian government to set transitory tariffs prior to privatization with the actual volumes transported The gas deferred account is estimated to be approximately US million plus approximately US MM for the hydrocarbon liquids deferred account giving a total of USMM Please see attached Gas Deferred Account and Total Deferred Account graphs These amounts represent the shortfall in revenues experienced due to insufficiently high transitory tariffs plus th e cost of capital at The recovery mechanism for the gas deferred account represents the mitigati on of a significant exposure that existed at the time we acquired the company the transportation concessions are nonexclusive and producers have the explicit right in the Hydrocarbon Law to build their own bypass pipelines yet the deferred account recovery mechanism placed the burden of recovery solely on the transportation tariffs of Transredes The change in regulations not only secures recovery of these amounts in a commercially viable manner but will disincentivize threatened bypasses In the future Transredes will also be able to fully recover all of its prudently incurred costs and rate of return via tariffs charged for transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions and the export g as concession We believe that the tariff mechanism for the domestic gas concession may require additional detail work The mechanism provides for a ceiling rate of US for transportation in the domestic concession and a surcharge on all export volumes of US These tariff components will no t be sufficient to recover the costs and rate of return contemplated by the Hydrocarbon Law to be recovered by Transredes However there appears to b e no impediment to collecting the revenue shortfall in the Transredes export gas tariff The regulatory team will continue trying to firm up this mechanism The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes rate case to move forward The rate case filing made in late January kicked off a process that will culminate in the approval of new economic rates to be effective on May The decree and rate case filing will also allow the Transredes financing program and pending bond issue to move forward These have been stalled fo r months due to lender doubts and uncertainty about rates and recovery of the deferred account Richard Shapiro PM To Ray NRON cc Steven J nron James D nron Subject Re Supreme Decree Congrats Ray Alvarez PM To Richard nron cc Subject Supreme Decree Rick I heard from my Bolivia regulatory team that the supreme decree is a reality and that it is very positive including full recovery of the MM gas deferred account that we were hanging out on I will provide more details as soon as I receive them Ray

<16772849.1075840019517.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-07-12 19:26:33,Summary Judges Recommendation re Retroactive Refundshis general perception of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

<29881213.1075840020386.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-06-12 16:16:44,CALL FOR WESTWIDE MITIGATION PLAN Cc a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday Summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC which plan should prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response Please see details below June The Honorable Curt H bert Jr Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hbert Since last summer the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in California Today the West continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West including several hearings in Washington and California we recommend that the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California We recognize the Commissions efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the California and western markets including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices While we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the West we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the entire West in the hot summer months to come To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets We strongly urge the Commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC Specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the WSCC The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power If the Commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law Aware of the danger of discouraging supply the Commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts We share the Commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply Accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution the Commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission To mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market In States where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less incentive to conserve While demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume Specifically the Commission should establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and enable consumers whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer We understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commissions previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter To ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on Friday June If you have questions please contact our staff

of Cals problem Ray Forwarded by Ray AlvarezTRANSREDES on AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should go with Plan B This involves building a really really really big kite KnightRidder Tribune

Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a Cli ff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California the y do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers b y the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opin ion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recommendations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of Californ ia believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialtype evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for a n answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period Octob er through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates associated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is lo cated in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by th e marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Financia l Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned delivery points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and holidays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the calculated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE an d SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the realtime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated t he same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergency requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount th at actual prices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

<5821449.1075858721086.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-07-12 21:26:00,Summary Judges Recommendation re Retroactive RefundsCommenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller
<29928572.1075858721181.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-07-10 21:50:00,Preliminary Comments on Judges RecommendationThe attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the Commiss ion this afternoon in order to provide FERC staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judges recommendation I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner at which Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the following high points The methodology of the June order does not work and is totally inapp ropriate for marketers If price mitigation is inevitable the Judge shoul d formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and af ter October All buyers including Enron should be entitled to refunds not just th e State of California and its IOUs Enron is a net purchaser in these mar kets Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the metho dology not bilateral contracts OOM sales or sales to the DWR The details of these points appear in the attached document The Judge was receptive to most points He understood the problems that the June met hodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this s hould be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form p art of his recommendation He agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should b e subject to the refund methodology Although he agreed that the refund me thodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he fel t that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the Commission The Judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight w ill shed some light as to the outcome I urged the Judge to recommend plac ing conditions to refunds as the Commission did in its June order with its RTO filing requirement The judge was noncommittal on this although h e did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday The Judge tol d us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday and t hat the comments would accompany the recommendation Thereafter it is lik ely that the Commission would defer to the Judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolv ed issues of material fact The scope of the hearing has not been determi ned but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle fo r marketers to recommend an alternative methodology

of Cals problem Ray Forwarded by Ray AlvarezTRANSREDES on AM Steve Hopper AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm

<30591910.1075852006879.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-07-10 11:50:00,Preliminary Comments on Judges Recommendationattached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the Commission this afternoon in order to provide FERC staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judges recommendation I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner at which Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the following high points The methodology of the June order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers If price mitigation is inevitable the Judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after October All buyers including Enron should be entitled to refunds not just the State of California and its IOUs Enron is a net purchaser in these markets Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts OOM sales or sales to the DWR The details of these points appear in the attached document The Judge was receptive to most points He understood the problems that the June methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation He agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology Although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the Commission The Judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome I urged the Judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the Commission did in its June order with its RTO filing requirement The judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday The Judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation Thereafter it is likely that the Commission would defer to the Judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact The scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology
<26760192.1075852007528.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-07-12 11:26:00,Summary Judges Recommendation re Retroactive Refundson his general perception of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a Cli ff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California the y do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers b y the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opin ion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recommendations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of Californ ia believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialtype evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for a n answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period Octob er through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates associated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is lo cated in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by th e marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Financia l Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned delivery points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and holidays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the calculated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE an d SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the realtime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated t he same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergency requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount th at actual prices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also

conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

of the settlement conference the Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday Summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC which plan should prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response Please see details below June The Honorable Curt H bert Jr Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hbert Since last summer the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in California Today the West continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West including several hearings in Washington and California we recommend that the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California We recognize the Commissions efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the California and western markets including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices While we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the West we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the entire West in the hot summer months to come To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets We strongly urge the Commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC Specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the WSCC The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power If the Commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law Aware of the danger of discouraging supply the Commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts We share the Commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply Accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution the Commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission To mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market In States where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less incentive to conserve While demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume Specifically the Commission should establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and enable consumers whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer We understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commissions previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter To ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on Friday June If you have

f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a C liff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opinio n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS Os and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O ctober through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate a nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Fina ncial Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and hol idays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

<5739757.1075843442024.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-04-25 03:18:00,Andersen releases reptort on CA crisis lessons for regulation and market Cc Attached for the reading pleasure of the CA team is the Andersen repo rt Energy Crisis in the Western US Reproduced below is a related article and that is followed by the text of the Andersen press release on the report Ray NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published April Andersen Warns Of Increased StateFederal Tensions The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasi ng over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets according to a new report issued Tuesday by Andersen The report Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields was unveiled by Andersens North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington DC briefing David Jermain principal with Andersens North American Energy Consultin g Practice noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis These aspects of the California virus will shape the longerterm operations of the Western grid the region al and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution he added The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Reduced investor confidence Contributing factor in economic softening Increased pressure on the Western grid Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage an d Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have been facing Jermain said If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question emerges namely whether state regulators will passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should occur Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition Jermain stated As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Wester n grid Jermain noted that Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western grid Such implications include a realistic chance that California could become an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a according to the Andersen report Also there could be increased emphasis o n security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have difficulties Along with yesterdays report Andersen also issued the results of an Andersen survey of senior executives from nonCalifornia utilities detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis fo r their companies and the industry The survey was conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing longterm supply contracts Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance o n them according to the Andersen survey The full Andersen report on the Western energy crisis can be downloaded at wwwandersencom ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California Power virus Andersen analysis WASHINGTON DC April A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro w if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat e regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent pruden ce review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator y risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliabil ity and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make n ew investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases a nd demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions ha ve longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerte rm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and souther n markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading an d marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests In addition limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a criti cal valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potentia l of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemerge nce of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The surve y conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarg et for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states wil l review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California s current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models o r strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are awar e of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompte d retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RT O deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster thei r basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply wi ll better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In additi on to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decision s in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortage s companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimprovi ng upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the company s future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industr y nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal

from Barton CA Bill A proposal calling on FERC to conduct a formal investigation into wholesale power rates in western markets has been stripped out of the latest discussion draft of emergency legislation that was released Tuesday by Chairman Joe Barton RTX of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Instead of proposing that the Commission undertake a Section probe to determine if prices are just and reasonable which could lead eventually to price controls Bartons latest draft provides a mix of demandmanagement incentives environmental waivers proposals to eliminate or reduce transmission constraints energy conservation measures and emergency preparedness initiatives to mitigate ballooning wholesale electricity and natural gas prices in ailing markets in California and other western states The decision to peel out the provision on the FERC price investigation did not come as a major surprise given the Republicans unyielding opposition to any federal intervention in wholesale power prices However this move could make it all the more difficult to report a bill out of the subcommittee and the full House Energy and Commerce Committee in light of Democratic members support for price caps andor costbased rates Bartons emergency legislation which seeks to provide supply and price relief in the West by this summer isnt expected to be formally introduced in the House until later this week Were shooting for sometime before the subcommittee hearing on the bill which is scheduled for next Tuesday said Barton spokeswoman Samantha Jordan Barton is expected to hold only one hearing on his legislation to be named The Electricity Emergency Act and then quickly proceed to markup Significantly the draft measure also stripped out a section that would have amended the Federal Power Act FPA to give FERC limited authority over the siting of transmission facilities Barton and subcommittee members were considering this move in an earlier discussion draft believing that such authority would help to hasten the construction of muchneeded transmission capacity Several members of the Commission also supported a move in this direction In what was seen a big blow for natural gas a section that would have required utilities to interconnect to distributed generation facilities has been taken out too Im not jumping for joy Im not upset To tell you the truth theres not much to comment on gas with distributed generation removed said a gas industry lobbyist I think that distributed generation will come back in a larger energy bill he noted But Im still unsure how far it the Barton bill will get in Congress Tuesdays discussion draft added a couple of new provisions Foremost it orders FERC to establish a program for consumers within the state Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC to resell at market prices the electricity that they dont consume but otherwise are entitled to use under contract or applicable regulation This provision is designed to give consumers a financial incentive to conserve power during peak demand The consumer could resell the unused electricity to either their utility or to a thirdparty purchaser In cases of thirdparty sales the local utility would credit the third party for the amount of power purchased Either way the local utility would receive the same amount of revenue that it would have received if the consumer had not opted to reduce consumption The consumer would benefit from conserving electricity and the resulting demand reduction would have a cooling effect on prices by bringing demand back into balance with supply according to a summary of the discussion draft The program would expire in October Another new provision directs the energy secretary to establish electric power transmission corridors across federal lands after conducting a study of the need for transmission expansion and determining that siting of transmission facilities on federal land is necessary and appropriate the summary said Barton also has added a section addressing the sale of transmission assets to the state of California In the event California acquires the transmission lines of a public utility such as Southern California Edison the draft proposes that the state be made subject to the same jurisdiction at FERC as had the public utility It further calls on the energy secretary to conduct an energy conservation educational campaign through the media to promote conservation in certain geographic regions where demand for electricity is expected to exceed available supplies in the near term Other provisions in the discussion draft which were in the earlier draft would Give state governors the opportunity to ask the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for temporary waivers of certain NOx emission requirements for newly constructed power plants for a period of two years Create a limited emergency provision for governors to submit plans to the EPA to allow natural gasfired power plants and onsite generators to exceed certain NOx limitations during power emergencies equivalent to the Stage III alerts in California and when blackouts are imminent Allow the energy secretary if requested by a governor to authorize any federal facility to generate electricity for selfconsumption or for sales to the state so long as compensation is assured by the purchasers or by the state Authorize the administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to require hydroelectric facilities that provide power to the BPA to step up their electric generation output if asked to do so by the governors of the Pacific Northwest states Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana The bill also would give hydroelectric licensees greater latitude to modify the terms andor conditions in their FERCapproved licenses to respond to power emergencies when declared by a state governor Authorize the administrator of the Western Area Power Administration System WAPA to expand its transmission system to eliminate the constraint on Path The bill would set aside up to million for this project All expansion costs would be recovered by WAPA through transmission fees or from the sale of ownership interests in transmission facilities Direct the energy secretary in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA to initiate emergency planning in states that are likely to face electricity shortages Direct FERC to establish a clearinghouse system for those who would want to auction electric energy to which they have contractual rights Allow qualifying facility QF generators to sell power to third parties when a utility is unable to pay under a purchase power agreement Prohibit the energy secretary FERC any other officer or agency of the federal government and the courts from ordering sellers to provide electricity or natural gas unless there is a guarantee that as determined by the Commission is sufficient to ensure that the seller will be paid the full purchase price when due Allow California Nevada Oregon and Washington to adjust their Standard Time if they find it can help to alleviate an electricity crisis Direct the energy secretary and FERC to do a joint study of transmission congestion and develop a plan to relieve constraints and report to Congress within six months of the legislations enactment and Direct a state governor to request an emergency reduction in energy consumption within that state Lastly Barton is considering including in the bill a provision that would require full participation in a westernwide regional transmission

served half by hydro and half by thermal the contingency reserve would be MW MW MW for a total of As a result Hebert could be right that price mitigation would be in place all the time although I dont think that was what was intended Even if you are meeting the WSCC standard precontingency in an all thermal system reserve standard every time a unit trips off line the reserve at that point drops

Than Ever By BOB DAVIS and REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhour with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among other things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energy companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market power of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout and riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesale energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a friend of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their networks to competitors Higher Profile For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aides Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any Ms Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathitt through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendly with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford Hes been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enron according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In April when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won the presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr Lay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House political adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White House officials Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison In both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all Finding the Bottlenecks The Cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity As Enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them An effort to make the grid national would enhance FERCs power as Enron has urged The report is mum on some Enron concerns such as requiring utilities to join regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utility industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involved in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevada repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states or perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the two chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework the governors might want to consider Though Mr Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr Racicot had joined the Washington DC lobbying firm Bracewell Patterson Mr Racicot didnt disclose that he was on retainer to Enron and the star of Enrons Western states advocacy team For his part Mr Racicot says he was working not at Enrons direction but with their knowledge to advance positions that he too feels are important Jeffrey White contributed to this article Write to Bob Davis at and Rebecca Smith

Chairman Hebert which appears below It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday Summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC which plan should prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response Please see details below June The Honorable Curt H bert Jr Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hbert Since last summer the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in California Today the West continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West including several hearings in Washington and California we recommend that the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California We recognize the Commissions efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the California and western markets including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices While we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the West we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the entire West in the hot summer months to come To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets We strongly urge the Commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC Specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the WSCC The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power If the Commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law Aware of the danger of discouraging supply the Commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts We share the Commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply Accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution the Commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission To mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market In States where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less incentive to conserve While demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume Specifically the Commission should establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and enable consumers whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer We understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commissions previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter To ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on Friday June If you have questions please contact our staff

Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a Cli ff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California the y do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers b y the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opin ion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recommendations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of Californ ia believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialtype evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for a n answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period Octob er through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates associated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is lo cated in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by th e marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Financia l Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned delivery points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and holidays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the calculated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE an d SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the realtime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated t he same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergency requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount th at actual prices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

CAISO to resettle all char ges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

Chie f Judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink Below is a Cli ff Notes version of the Judges report and recommendation issued at PM today Attached is the complete work The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due While the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the State of California the y do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum At the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers b y the CAISO the investor owned utilities and the State of California Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller The Chief Judge thinks not Another notable quote it is the opin ion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July which wa s summarily rejected by the State of California and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected Refund Effective Date Refund effective date of October for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX The Chief Judges recommendations do not go beyond that date Spot market sales are sales that are hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery Evidentiary Hearing The differences between what the State of Californ ia believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes Thus the Chief Judge recommends that a trialtype evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below Because of the urgent need for a n answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding However such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation In any event sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period Methodology The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he June th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISOs and Cal PXs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period Octob er through May Heat Rate The actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates associated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the June th Order provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit Gas Cost The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price In the event that the marginal unit is lo cated in NP North of Path the daily spot gas price for PGE Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour If the marginal unit is located in SP South of Path the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by th e marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour The daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in Financia l Times Energys Gas Daily publication for the aforementioned delivery points The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published weekends and holidays OM Adder An adder of MWh for OM should also be included with the calculated market clearing price Emissions Costs Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation Credit Adder The percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after January when PGE an d SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy Ancillary Services Consistent with the June th Order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the realtime imbalance energy market Adjustment bids would also be treated t he same as set forth in the June th Order Maximum Price for NonEmergency Hours Somewhat unclear The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergency requirement of the June th Order To measure the amount th at actual prices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated Offsets Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period Interest Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

<25576660.1075849448841.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ray.alvarez@enron.com,2001-06-12 09:16:00,CALL FOR WESTWIDE MITIGATION PLAN Cc obtained a copy of a letter from Representative Tauzin and others to FERC Chairman Hebert which appears below It could provide some indication of the direction FERC will take with the order it plans to issue next Monday Summarizing the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire WSCC which plan should prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms rather than imposing rigid price controls and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response Please see details below June The Honorable Curt H bert Jr Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hbert Since last summer the Committee on Energy and Commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in California Today the West continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century and California faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer After extensive review of the energy crisis in the West including several hearings in Washington and California we recommend that the Commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into California We recognize the Commissions efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the California and western markets including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices While we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the West we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in California and the entire West in the hot summer months to come To ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe the Commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets We strongly urge the Commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC Specifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the WSCC The plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power If the Commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law Aware of the danger of discouraging supply the Commission has relied upon marketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts We share the Commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supply Accordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solution the Commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission To mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge the Commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market In States where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have less incentive to conserve While demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity Such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive prices foregone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume Specifically the Commission should establish or certify a wholesale clearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and enable consumers whether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchasers We recognize that individual States and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer We understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting State laws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipant consumers We look forward to working with you to build upon the Commissions previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in California and the West this summer and thereafter To ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible We request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on Friday June If you have questions please contact our staff

controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energy companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market power of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout and riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesale energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a friend of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their networks to competitors Higher Profile For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aides Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any Ms Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathitt through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendly with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford Hes been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enron according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In April when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won the presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr Lay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House political adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White House officials Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison In both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all Finding the Bottlenecks The Cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity As Enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them An effort to make the grid national would enhance FERCs power as Enron has urged The report is mum on some Enron concerns such as requiring utilities to join regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utility industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involved in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevada repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states or perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the two chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework the governors might want to consider Though Mr Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr Racicot had joined the Washington DC lobbying firm Bracewell Patterson Mr Racicot didnt disclose that he was on retainer to Enron and the star of Enrons Western states advocacy team For his part Mr Racicot says he was working not at Enrons direction but with their knowledge to advance positions that he too feels are important Jeffrey White contributed to this article Write to Bob Davis at and Rebecca Smith

Re House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on CaliforniaWestern Electric Situation Ray Commissioner Hebert may have been more accurate than he supposed in his Freudian slip The contingency reserve standard in WSCC is the greater of the largest single contingency or of a quantity equal to the sum of times the load portion served by hydro plus for the load portion served by thermal units For MW served half by hydro and half by thermal the contingency reserve would be MW MW MW for a total of As a result Hebert could be right that price mitigation would be in place all the time although I dont think that was what was intended Even if you are meeting the WSCC standard precontingency in an all thermal system reserve standard every time a unit trips off line the reserve at that point drops below until more generation comes on line Did the FERC mean to include this contingency recovery period as any time the reserve is below These are among the problems we are proposing to address in our

from Barton CA Bill A proposal calling on FERC to conduct a formal investigation into wholesale power rates in western markets has been stripped out of the latest discussion draft of emergency legislation that was released Tuesday by Chairman Joe Barton RTX of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Instead of proposing that the Commission undertake a Section probe to determine if prices are just and reasonable which could lead eventually to price controls Bartons latest draft provides a mix of demandmanagement incentives environmental waivers proposals to eliminate or reduce transmission constraints energy conservation measures and emergency preparedness initiatives to mitigate ballooning wholesale electricity and natural gas prices in ailing markets in California and other western states The decision to peel out the provision on the FERC price investigation did not come as a major surprise given the Republicans unyielding opposition to any federal intervention in wholesale power prices However this move could make it all the more difficult to report a bill out of the subcommittee and the full House Energy and Commerce Committee in light of Democratic members support for price caps andor costbased rates Bartons emergency legislation which seeks to provide supply and price relief in the West by this summer isnt expected to be formally introduced in the House until later this week Were shooting for sometime before the subcommittee hearing on the bill which is scheduled for next Tuesday said Barton spokeswoman Samantha Jordan Barton is expected to hold only one hearing on his legislation to be named The Electricity Emergency Act and then quickly proceed to markup Significantly the draft measure also stripped out a section that would have amended the Federal Power Act FPA to give FERC limited authority over the siting of transmission facilities Barton and subcommittee members were considering this move in an earlier discussion draft believing that such authority would help to hasten the construction of muchneeded transmission capacity Several members of the Commission also supported a move in this direction In what was seen a big blow for natural gas a section that would have required utilities to interconnect to distributed generation facilities has been taken out too Im not jumping for joy Im not upset To tell you the truth theres not much to comment on gas with distributed generation removed said a gas industry lobbyist I think that distributed generation will come back in a larger energy bill he noted But Im still unsure how far it the Barton bill will get in Congress Tuesdays discussion draft added a couple of new provisions Foremost it orders FERC to establish a program for consumers within the state Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC to resell at market prices the electricity that they dont consume but otherwise are entitled to use under contract or applicable regulation This provision is designed to give consumers a financial incentive to conserve power during peak demand The consumer could resell the unused electricity to either their utility or to a thirdparty purchaser In cases of thirdparty sales the local utility would credit the third party for the amount of power purchased Either way the local utility would receive the same amount of revenue that it would have received if the consumer had not opted to reduce consumption The consumer would benefit from conserving electricity and the resulting demand reduction would have a cooling effect on prices by bringing demand back into balance with supply according to a summary of the discussion draft The program would expire in October Another new provision directs the energy secretary to establish electric power transmission corridors across federal lands after conducting a study of the need for transmission expansion and determining that siting of transmission facilities on federal land is necessary and appropriate the summary said Barton also has added a section addressing the sale of transmission assets to the state of California In the event California acquires the transmission lines of a public utility such as Southern California Edison the draft proposes that the state be made subject to the same jurisdiction at FERC as had the public utility It further calls on the energy secretary to conduct an energy conservation educational campaign through the media to promote conservation in certain geographic regions where demand for electricity is expected to exceed available supplies in the near term Other provisions in the discussion draft which were in the earlier draft would Give state governors the opportunity to ask the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for temporary waivers of certain NOx emission requirements for newly constructed power plants for a period of two years Create a limited emergency provision for governors to submit plans to the EPA to allow natural gasfired power plants and onsite generators to exceed certain NOx limitations during power emergencies equivalent to the Stage III alerts in California and when blackouts are imminent Allow the energy secretary if requested by a governor to authorize any federal facility to generate electricity for selfconsumption or for sales to the state so long as compensation is assured by the purchasers or by the state Authorize the administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration to require hydroelectric facilities that provide power to the BPA to step up their electric generation output if asked to do so by the governors of the Pacific Northwest states Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana The bill also would give hydroelectric licensees greater latitude to modify the terms andor conditions in their FERCapproved licenses to respond to power emergencies when declared by a state governor Authorize the administrator of the Western Area Power Administration System WAPA to expand its transmission system to eliminate the constraint on Path The bill would set aside up to million for this project All expansion costs would be recovered by WAPA through transmission fees or from the sale of ownership interests in transmission facilities Direct the energy secretary in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA to initiate emergency planning in states that are likely to face electricity shortages Direct FERC to establish a clearinghouse system for those who would want to auction electric energy to which they have contractual rights Allow qualifying facility QF generators to sell power to third parties when a utility is unable to pay under a purchase power agreement Prohibit the energy secretary FERC any other officer or agency of the federal government and the courts from ordering sellers to provide electricity or natural gas unless there is a guarantee that as determined by the Commission is sufficient to ensure that the seller will be paid the full purchase price when due Allow California Nevada Oregon and Washington to adjust their Standard Time if they find it can help to alleviate an electricity crisis Direct the energy secretary and FERC to do a joint study of transmission congestion and develop a plan to relieve constraints and report to Congress within six months of the legislations enactment and Direct a state governor to request an emergency reduction in energy consumption within that state Lastly Barton is considering including in the bill a provision that would require full participation in a westernwide regional transmission organization RTO if agreed to by at least of governors within the WSCC All federal facilities would be directed to participate in the RTO as would municipallyowned utilities and cooperatives owning or operating transmission facilities within the region The requirement to participate would sunset three years after the RTO is established

the CA team is the Andersen repo rt Energy Crisis in the Western US Reproduced below is a related article and that is followed by the text of the Andersen press release on the report Ray NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published April Andersen Warns Of Increased StateFederal Tensions The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasi ng over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets according to a new report issued Tuesday by Andersen The report Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields was unveiled by Andersens North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington DC briefing David Jermain principal with Andersens North American Energy Consultin g Practice noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis These aspects of the California virus will shape the longerterm operations of the Western grid the region al and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution he added The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Reduced investor confidence Contributing factor in economic softening Increased pressure on the Western grid Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage an d Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have been facing Jermain said If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question emerges namely whether state regulators will passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should occur Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition Jermain stated As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Wester n grid Jermain noted that Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western grid Such implications include a realistic chance that California could become an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a according to the Andersen report Also there could be increased emphasis o n security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have difficulties Along with yesterdays report Andersen also issued the results of an Andersen survey of senior executives from nonCalifornia utilities detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis fo r their companies and the industry The survey was conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse On the deregulation front nearly all the executives surveyed said they believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over th e next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will result in advanced states deciding to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it As to legislation at the federal level the survey found that few execut ives suggest that the California situation will spark national energy policylegislation Other executives believe that it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Turning to company strategies most of the executives surveyed do not se e any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have among other things expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing longterm supply contracts Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance o n them according to the Andersen survey The full Andersen report on the Western energy crisis can be downloaded at wwwandersencom ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California Power virus Andersen analysis WASHINGTON DC April A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go f ar beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practi ce head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely t o affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster sho ts are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must foc us on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with gover nment officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of th e Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro w if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat e regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent pruden ce review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator y risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliabil ity and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make n ew investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases a nd demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions ha ve longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to Californi a increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerte rm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and souther n markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading an d marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests In addition limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a criti cal valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potentia l of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemerge nce of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The surve y conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarg et for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states wil l review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California s current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models o r strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are awar e of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompte d retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RT O deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster thei r basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply wi ll better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In additi on to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decision s in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortage s companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimprovi ng upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the company s future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industr y nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal David O Jermain Simplify market design Build a continuing role for regulators Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions Couple
