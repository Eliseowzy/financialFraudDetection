pursue new opportunities I am leaving with regret as I have enjoyed working with all of you and I believe EBS is poised for great success in Asia To assist in a smooth transition I have prepared this report on the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions I am working on and my thoughts about next steps A list of key contacts is also provided Mark Schroeder will reassign pending actions Again many many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I have learned about broadband and EBS from each of you Singapore a SBO License Application The application was completed in draft in December Dan Arzola of EBS Asia has a copy in Houston We cannot proceed further on the application until we decide what legal entity to use We have a legal entity Enron Broadband Services Pte Ltd set up that encompasses all EBS activities including bandwidth t trading The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a annual gross turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds that the turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading revenue This is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator IDA does not want to be working at cross purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS with incentives See below b Legal Due Diligence However before pursuing a waiver from IDA we were planning to complete legal due diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a waiver Donald is of the view see his Jan email that bandwidth trading has to be licensed by the regulator In Europe bandwidth trading usually does not require telecom licensing If Donald is correct as he probably is there may be less need of further legal research on that point unless perhaps to confirm absolutely that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the turnover fee apart from a waiver or reduction of the fee For example it is possible that Jan Haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee done offshore for example Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced in the context of Korea I believe it would still be prudent to proceed as we had planned to engage a law firm here in Singapore as we have in Hong Kong and Japan for the purpose of guiding us through these sorts of questions or at least confirming our reading and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by Wayne Gardner We will likely be needing the firm anyway at some point I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms practice in Singapore EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom to send and when to engage a firm to complete Waynes questionnaire and for other purposes My advice is after the due diligence is completed or we have at least confirmed that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity probably to go to the IDA and discuss the implications of the fee for us The contacts I would suggest discussing this with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo see contact list IDA does not wish to prevent EBSs coming to Singapore and the fee was of course set up without bandwidth trading specifically in mind as a revenue source Bandwidth trading was referenced in the Code only later as a result of Enrons comment letters c Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status Application This k proposal is now with us in final form after undergoing changes by me and two by our Houston tax lawyers I was to have gone to ADL Singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to do independently without reliance on us This was a suggestion made by Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our info I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would be quantified rather than a where appropriate Assuming we proceed with this proposal someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and most other interested parties earlier this week NB Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL and explain at least our timing and process for getting back to him as a courtesy I have not replied to his final submission as of now See contact info at end of email For background the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought a consultant proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded to companies that make major dollar infrastructure and jobcreation expenditures in Singapore Our business model does just the opposite So to be awarded Pioneer Status which the EDB is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion I believe we need to help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spinoff benefits are for Singapore from our developing bandwidth trading here eg increased efficiencies of capacity utilization effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment This is a job for a development economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading To my mind if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want it might be worth it to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with them and adjust the contract accordingly to reflect what part we are providing One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual completion of the Pioneer Status Application only the supporting economic analysis That is because it is proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for Singapore rather than running that information through ADL and charging its overhead The idea is to get ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we cannot do inhouse d Direct contact with EDB on EBSs plans EDB Chelsia Lim has this week asked EBS to update her on its business plans for Singapore I have made sure Craig Clark will take the responsibility for seeing this is handled While a courtesy call is fine I would advise not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our plans are with staffing etc They have been asking for our plans for a while and are waiting for some specifics when we have them Hong Kong We have licenses IVANS value added services and ETS external telecoms services includes bandwidth trading There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be filed under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong The principal ones are a the system configuration plan b the tariff for sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license c the tariff for Mediacast services under the IVANS license and later d a tariff for VODEOD to be filed under the IVANS license a status of system configuration plan The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to whether the Lucent G equipment described in the plan will be changed to other equipment The HK lawyers Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance have said that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset we ought to just wait and send in the correct description rather than revise If we do stick with the Lucent equipment we will also need to revise our orginal license application as well says Michelle Chan to include description of related Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license application When the system configuration plan is done in final we also need to change the listed destination in the diagram from San Jose to West Coast USA Japan Singapore and Australia There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the OFTA forms I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston The other copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office When we know what equipment we are going to be using Tom Wei needs to revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred to above Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A see Dec email referenced below My successor should review the whole package once more with Michelle Chan in final Then the final package needs to be cleared by Anthony Duenner and our EBS lawyers before going to Ken Rice or another qualified Director of our Hong Kong company for signature After that it goes back to Michelle Chan for filing with OFTA NB See Michelle Chans email of Dec being repeated separately for further information b Tariffs for BWTrading under ETS License In December in Houston I worked with Bill White and his staff on a tariff plan for bandwidth trading in HK Based on a meeting I had with the regulator in Hong Kong we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an entirely new and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do Ceiling prices were developed and submitted to Michelle Chan for review Along with the prices we are required to submit our Terms and Conditions For that I used EBS General Terms and Conditions GTCs for trading obtained from Robbi Rossi and Michelle Heard Mike Grimes has a set as well Present status Right now a dialogue is under way between Michelle Chan and Robbi Rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the GTCs alone or whether certain exhibits service level agreements and confirmations referred to in the GTCs must also be filed There are other questions being discussed in that channel such as how to handle variations in the terms based on commercial dynamics All these emails will be forwarded Once these issues related to the GTCs are resolved the tariff for bandwidth trading should be filed going through Michelle Chan NB See Michelle Chan email of which being forwarded separately c Tariff for Media Cast under IVANS license I worked with Leroy Ho and Ken Wang in December and we submitted the main part of the Media Cast tariff to Michelle Chan However we still need to get the Terms and Conditions for Media Cast from Robbi Rossi or Michelle Heard and attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to Michelle Chan NB See my email to Michelle Chan of Dec which being repeated Someone needs to work with EBS legal to get the T and Cs for Media Cast to Michelle or to set up direct channel between EBS legal and Michelle Chan as in the case of the exchanges on the T and Cs for Bandwidth trading referred to above d Overall change of responsibility for EBS Regulatory HK Michael or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities should get from Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance Hong Kong a fresh copy of Alison Lindsays letter to Xi Xi of October stating that we received our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements This is the master document bible on compliance under our licenses and will catch any detail not included above For example my successor should also file a new form with OFTA the Hong Kong regulator form is included in the attachments to the letter naming himself the point of contact replacing me Michelle Chan can forward the letter to the regulator we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine reports we may need to file in future I have not started on that Korea Robbi Rossi needs to call Kim and Chang law firm we use in Korea to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to handle the apparent regulatory impediment to Bandwidth Trading in Korea that we identified during my November trip Once Kim and Chang starts work on this someone from regulatory should be made available to help guide Kim and Chang on our regulatory questions in coordination with Robbi Rossi The key emails are a one from me outlining the overall problem and some suggestions for dealing with it b one from Jan Haizmann with some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how to deal with it c two from Jae Moo Lee in Korea with additional points of view These will be forwarded Japan Our regulatory consultant is Art Yanagawa Contact info below Mike Grimes and I have been in meetings with him and Mike is fully briefed to carry on the ontheground part of contacts with Art Art also responds to Donald and Roger Estrada and relies on them for guidance and input At some point it should be thought through who should be the point person to manage this contract and approve payments or decide to leave things as they are with approvals done in Houston The present system works but it is not clear to me who is responsible for what Art has prepared the amendment to our Special Type license to add service to other destinations The latest status was that he was holding the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by Mike Grimes Someone needs to be assigned responsibility for getting the amendment through General Concern A more general regulatory concern for us in Japan is that our consultant advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading in communications with the government because it is not something contemplated in the Telecom Business Law so is prohibited if stated as we would state it elsewhere We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something else I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now and can offer nothing better for the immediate term However I would say that long term we are running some risks If we are going to make Japan one of the centerpieces of our Asia EBS strategy I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS regulatory resources to Japan exclusively The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply have to focus on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications Business Law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly This would seem important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy Digital Divide I had been giving intermittent support to helping Scott Yeager and Justin Cornett of EBS and Will Reed of Technology for All figure out how to expand the concept of Technology for All to Asia The strategy was to utilize some of Japans billion pledge of funds to support digital divide activities in Asia to support the expansion into Asia of the EBSsupported TFA model This work will cease unless it can be

concern for us in Japan is that our consultant advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading in communications with the government because it is not something contemplated in the Telecom Business Law so is prohibited if stated as we would state it elsewhere We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something else I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now and can offer nothing better for the immediate term However I would say that long term we are running some risks If we are going to make Japan one of the centerpieces of our Asia EBS strategy I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS regulatory resources to Japan exclusively The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply have to focus on immediate license amendment and operational questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications Business Law to allow bandwidth trading explicitly This would seem important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy Digital Divide I had been giving

new opportunities I am leaving with regret as I have enjoyed working with all of you and I believe EBS is poised for great success in Asia To assist in a smooth transition I have prepared this report on the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions I am working on and my thoughts about next steps A list of key contacts is also provided Mark Schroeder will reassign pending actions Again many many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I have learned about broadband and EBS from each of you Singapore a SBO License Application The application was completed in draft in December Dan Arzola of EBS Asia has a copy in Houston We cannot proceed further on the application until we decide what legal entity to use We have a legal entity Enron Broadband Services Pte Ltd set up that encompasses all EBS activities including bandwidth t trading The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a annual gross turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds that the turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading revenue This is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator IDA does not want to be working at cross purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS with incentives See below b Legal Due Diligence However before pursuing a waiver from IDA we were planning to complete legal due diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a waiver Donald is of the view see his Jan email that bandwidth trading has to be licensed by the regulator In Europe bandwidth trading usually does not require telecom licensing If Donald is correct as he probably is there may be less need of further legal research on that point unless perhaps to confirm absolutely that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the turnover fee apart from a waiver or reduction of the fee For example it is possible that Jan Haizmann or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee done offshore for example Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced in the context of Korea I believe it would still be prudent to proceed as we had planned to engage a law firm here in Singapore as we have in Hong Kong and Japan for the purpose of guiding us through these sorts of questions or at least confirming our reading and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working group headed by Wayne Gardner We will likely be needing the firm anyway at some point I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms practice in Singapore EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom to send and when to engage a firm to complete Waynes questionnaire and for other purposes My advice is after the due diligence is completed or we have at least confirmed that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity probably to go to the IDA and discuss the implications of the fee for us The contacts I would suggest discussing this with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo see contact list IDA does not wish to prevent EBSs coming to Singapore and the fee was of course set up without bandwidth trading specifically in mind as a revenue source Bandwidth trading was referenced in the Code only later as a result of Enrons comment letters c Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status Application This k proposal is now with us in final form after undergoing changes by me and two by our Houston tax lawyers I was to have gone to ADL Singapore next for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to do independently without reliance on us This was a suggestion made by Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our info I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would be quantified rather than a where appropriate Assuming we proceed with this proposal someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and most other interested parties earlier this week NB Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL and explain at least our timing and process for getting back to him as a courtesy I have not replied to his final submission as of now See contact info at end of email For background the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought a consultant proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded to companies that make major dollar infrastructure and jobcreation expenditures in Singapore Our business model does just the opposite So to be awarded Pioneer Status which the EDB is very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion I believe we need to help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spinoff benefits are for Singapore from our developing bandwidth trading here eg increased efficiencies of capacity utilization effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment This is a job for a development economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading To my mind if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want it might be worth it to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with them and adjust the contract accordingly to reflect what part we are providing One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual completion of the Pioneer Status Application only the supporting economic analysis That is because it is proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for Singapore rather than running that information through ADL and charging its overhead The idea is to get ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we cannot do inhouse d Direct contact with EDB on EBSs plans EDB Chelsia Lim has this week asked EBS to update her on its business plans for Singapore I have made sure Craig Clark will take the responsibility for seeing this is handled While a courtesy call is fine I would advise not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our plans are with staffing etc They have been asking for our plans for a while and are waiting for some specifics when we have them Hong Kong We have licenses IVANS value added services and ETS external telecoms services includes bandwidth trading There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be filed under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong The principal ones are a the system configuration plan b the tariff for sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license c the tariff for Mediacast services under the IVANS license and later d a tariff for VODEOD to be filed under the IVANS license a status of system configuration plan The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to whether the Lucent G equipment described in the plan will be changed to other equipment The HK lawyers Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance have said that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset we ought to just wait and send in the correct description rather than revise If we do stick with the Lucent equipment we will also need to revise our orginal license application as well says Michelle Chan to include description of related Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license application When the system configuration plan is done in final we also need to change the listed destination in the diagram from San Jose to West Coast USA Japan Singapore and Australia There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the OFTA forms I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston The other copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office When we know what equipment we are going to be using Tom Wei needs to revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred to above Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A see Dec email referenced below My successor should review the whole package once more with Michelle Chan in final Then the final package needs to be cleared by Anthony Duenner and our EBS lawyers before going to

keep getting deferred the Singapore license entity and a regulatory issue in Korea The deferral of the Singapore one defers our license application and our timeline for Singapore I told the commercial team we hoped to deal with it in this weeks call but that even then the license would slip to January with Singapore processing time So we need to try to decide the entity this week or next either in this call or by email or in a separate call whatever is the most efficient way Otherwise with the holidays we may lose an additional month What is the best mechanism to decide this In Singapore if we can see our way clear to go with the already established entity of course that would be simpler but I defer to the groups judgment For the Korea question perhaps all we need to do is agree to ask Kim and Chang to look at it including mine and Jan Haizmans and JaeMoo Lees thoughts and give us their advice If legal authorizes that I can get some material worked up to send I will be on the Thursday call from the beginning unless I am in the air in which case I will join around minutes into the call Thanks To Donald LassereEnron nron Communications Sue nron Michelle HicksEnron nron Communications

that we are restricted to one option the Regulatory Structure from a regulatory standpoint with respect to the trading of Japanese bandwidth Determine whether there are similar restrictions in SIngapore or Hong Kong requiring us to adopt a similar Regulatory Structure Review the tax costs and risks arising from the Regulatory Structure and describe the steps that must be taken to manage the tax risks Given the foregoing determine what specific steps are necessary to implement the Regulatory Structure and manage the concomitant tax legal accounting and credit risks Review what steps if any are necessary to permit bandwidth trading by the US and UK trading desks of bandwidth terminating in Australia Time permitting determine whether regulatory considerations require that we adopt a structure similar to the Regulatory Structure in Mexico Brazil or Argentina Time permitting review what steps if any are necessary to permit bandwidth trading by the US and the UK trading desks of

Wayne Gardner To Sue NordNAEnron cc James GintyEnron nron Communications Donald LassereEnron nron Communications David MerrillENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Japan Trading Dear Sue Because of the important role of Japan in the trading business of EBS I want to make sure I understand very clearly our regulatory options For the sake of simplicity I limit the discussion below to trading of segments between Japan and the US on the grounds that the Japanese principles that apply to any other trading of international segments would be identical The discussion is further limited to the purchase of IPLCs because that is the standard form of telecom capacity available for purchase out of Japan Finally based on input from Regulatory the discussion assumes that the purchased IPLCs are divided into halfcircuits The Japan halfcircuit terminates in Japan and in the middle of the Pacific The US halfcircuit terminates in the middle of the Pacific picking up where the Japan halfcircuit terminates and in the US I Our only option from a regulatory standpoint We understand that the only option from a regulatory prespective is as follows EBS Networks YK YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits because it has an ST license and switch in Japan through which it will route ALL trades EBS Trading LP Trading purchases the US halfcircuits only Each of Trading and YK can resell their respective halfcircuits in the form of capacity under the EBS Master Services Agreement the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers II Tax consequences of structuring trades in accordance with this option At best the tax consequences of the foregoing are that half of the earnings on Japan to US trading will be subject to immediate Japan income tax with no ability to defer the cash payment of tax with Enrons US tax loss carryforward In addition there may be significant exposure to US income tax we are in the midst of quantifying this risk and evaluating potential ways around it which would incrementally increase the effective income tax rate to If instead Trading undertook all the Trading activity virtually all of the earnings of Japan to US trading would be subject to a single rate of US income tax and the payment of such tax could be deferred for a significant period of time due to Enrons large US tax loss carryforward III The following options have been ruled out by Regulatory for the following reasons Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license Trading buys US and Japan halfcircuits directly and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even though YK has an ST license Japanese telecom regs provide that a reseller of Japanese IPLC capacity must hold an ST license directly In other words the regulations provide that no affiliate of the YK licensee may resell IPLCs unless that affiliate itself acquires a license Moreover Trading cannot claim that it is not engaged in resale activities that require an ST license Japanese telecom regulations treat the resale of capacity under the Master as a resale of the underlying IPLC Unworkable Option Trading does not acquire an ST license YK purchases the Japan halfcircuits Trading purchases the US halfcircuits YK then resells the Japan halfcircuits to Trading Trading then resells the entire circuits under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers For the reasons set forth under Option this option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint even if the sale from the YK to Trading and the subsequent resale by Trading occur in tandem one immediately after the other Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV executes a costplus contract with EBS Networks YK The costplus contract provides that SPV has the right to use and control the telecom equipment owned by EBS Networks YK in exchange for periodic payments based on the cost of the equipment SPV buys entire circuits and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master to others who may be resellers or endusers This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease the equipment through which it trades capacity Even if it were legal from a regulatory standpoint this option is NOT workable because the companies that control the Japanese capacity market would sell only to a licensed Japanese company Unworkable Option EBS Trading LP forms a whollyowned US special purpose vehicle SPV which obtains an ST license SPV establishes a local branch in Japan and controls a nominal amount of the telecom equipment in Japan through which the SPVs Japanese trading is switched or routed SPV buys Japan to US full circuit IPLCs and resells them in the form of capacity under the Master Sales Agreement This option is illegal from a regulatory standpoint because SPV does not own or lease ALL the

Japanese permanent establishment subject to Japanese income tax on the earnings attributed to it Please confirm clarify where ambiguous or correct where inaccurate Due to the extremely tax inefficient results of what appears to be our only option we need to be absolutely certain that our understanding is correct Is it clear that there are no other options here Thanks W Wayne Gardner Enron Broadband
