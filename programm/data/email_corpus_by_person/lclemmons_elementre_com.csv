image moved to file picjpg A part from an airplane that crashed in the Great Salt Lake on Sunday Danny La The Salt Lake Tribune BY NESREEN KHASHAN THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE GREAT SALT LAKE Tooele Valley Airport weekend manager Gary Parks heard the steady buzz of the KingAir Beech overhead It was pm on Sunday when he recognized the unmistakable sound of the twinengine aircraft flying over the Great Salt Lake minutes before it spiraled into the icy waters below killing all nine people on board When the plane went down snow was driving down hard and there was about a quartermile visibility around Tooele Valley Parks said While he wondered if the plane might land at a different airport having unshakable confidence in John Cashman the planes veteran pilot he didnt think the worst No I didnt have a bad feeling Parks said He was the best most competent pilot Id ever seen in my life Today federal investigators including an official from the National Transportation Safety Board are expected to begin examining the conditions that led to the crash A barge hauling a crane is scheduled to arrive around noon to recover the shattered remains of the plane which rests in about feet of water miles west and one mile north of the Salt Lake Marina Preliminary reports indicate that the plane was flying under visual flight regulations or VFR which require that minimum visibility and weather standards be met said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Michael Fergus from Seattle But federal investigators said there are no indications yet whether adverse weather played a role in the crash Investigators still dont know if the pilot used or switched to flight instruments to navigate which are most commonly used to compensate for poor visibility The plane carrying Cashman and eight skydivers was returning from a weekend of jumping in Mesquite Nev Two of the skydivers husband and wife were the owners of Skydive Salt Lake a Tooelebased company Keith Stewart the companys only other fulltime employee said the plane was used to make up to jumps in Nevada from Friday through Sunday Parks said he attempted to make radio contact with the plane immediately after he heard its engines Investigators said Cashman never signaled for help and Parks efforts to reach the pilot were fruitless he said About five minutes later the husband of one of the planes passengers arrived at the airport to pick up his wife Parks said at around pm the mans wife had called her husband to say she was boarding The yearold plane didnt have a registered flight plan with the FAA That meant airport officials didnt know it was in the air when Parks began calling around to see if the plane had landed at an alternate location So when airport officials began searching for the aircraft about two hours after it disappeared they examined several hours of radar reports to determine the planes location said Tooele County sheriffs Deputy Lt Frank Park Searchandrescue officials believe that the four women and five men died instantly as the plane hit the water fragmenting into pieces Flying in from the southwest the plane was probably making a degree turn into the Tooele airport runway when it went down airport officials say The first body was found at am Monday by the shores of the marina During the next several hours all nine bodies were recovered Seven of the bodies were also found on the shore Through the rest of Monday morning a crew of at least three dozen on three boats concentrated on recovering personal effects from the plane Brian Hall one of the rescue workers who scoured the waters with flashlights that pierced the darkness said the hardest part was not knowing what you were going to find until you got there Recovery crews retrieved foam pads helmets parachutes and other skydiving equipment Parks said he was struck more than once by the commonplace items like a single shoe floating in the water that were meticulously plucked from the scene Most backpacks duffle bags and other luggage that were floating were still zipped shut but Parks recalled one large blue suitcase that had burst open scattering articles of clothing over the water Ive been doing this for a lot of years and it never gets easy Parks commented Unfortunately any time youre involved with any tragedy like this there will always be reminders of its personal nature Mondays crash comes exactly five years after a small plane crash in Idaho in which six Utah businessmen and two pilots were killed Tribune reporter Kevin Cantera contributed to this report email List of the Victims Pilot John T
