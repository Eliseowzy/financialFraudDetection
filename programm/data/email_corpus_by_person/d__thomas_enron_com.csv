Industrialinfocom BusinessEnergy Editors HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREJan The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants which could represent part of the answer to worlds power generation needs over the next years has taken a few steps forward in the consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months However nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental groups and those involved with postChernobyl public health concerns The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor PBMR from Eskom in South Africa continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and appropriate Stakeholders in the project include the US company Exelon with Eskom with British Nuclear Fuels with Industrial Development Corporation of SA with and Black empowerment at Currently Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of PBMRs at a price of around billion USD Early in the company requested the US National Regulatory Commission to start laying the groundwork for PBMR licensing Exelon would like to see the million demonstration unit which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model to show that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety efficiency and viability are proven enough for US regulatory agencies to proceed forward with licensing The plant is to be built alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape Province of South Africa with work commencing in If approved Exelon may then start concurrent construction of US sites to bring PBMRgenerated power to market at the earliest possible date and at the best price Specifications and claims by Eskom who purchased the technology after a year development and proving period in Germany present the PBMR as small safe clean cost efficient inexpensive and adaptable The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere mm in diameter The PBMR design makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a closed cycle gas turbine and generator The design differences between the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a safe and economical power plant The annual world market for power generation is estimated at billion The PBMR if it comes through its regulatory trials would be in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action With of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black empowerment shareholders plant export orders a year could contribute nearly billion a year to South Africas Gross Domestic Product and another billion in export income An estimated direct and indirect jobs would be created These figures would double and triple for or orders annually If the demo plant achieves its targets Eskom will place an order for modules with the Exelon order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the first US plant in Eskom will sell PBMRs as a manufactured item with no rights given Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured reactor and site construction related The aim is for of the sourcing to come from South Africa Taxpayers money approximately million so far is being spent by the South African authorities in giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the project before the go decision is given With this right and proper concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of nuclear power generation The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a significant move A contract has been placed in midJanuary with the US company Stone Webster and South African construction company Murray Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project in engineering procurement construction management and project management Following this development the PBMR management at Eskom have gone on record to state that with the multinational and multidisciplinary support now providing leverage the approval hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the government Industrailinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial market place including

sometimes divided by regional differences economic disparities or linguistic snits find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon a national drought From Atlantic to Pacific from the Arctic to the US border most of the worlds secondlargest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades In many ways this drought is the same tune thats being played right across the country Its a different look different season and different impact but nevertheless everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country said David Phillips a senior climatologist with Environment Canada Whether its fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario many will remember the summer of Itll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think Too much excess and not enough normal said Phillips In parts of British Columbia water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winters record low snowfall in the mountains Weve had normal summer in terms of rain But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble said Jim Mattison Water Management Director for BCs Bureau of Sustainable Resources But the devastation is most apparent in Canadas breadbasket the Prairies Many farmers especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan have already written off their crops Ive been here since I have never in my life ever seen anything like this Norman Stienwand a farmer in Castor Alberta told Reuters ITS BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION Theres no water The grasshoppers are so bad Its beyond your imagination said Stienwand who farms hectares acres of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle It has been so sweltering in his region located about km miles west of the Saskatchewan border that some of Stienwands farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock Its just going to destroy a lot of farmers Theyre just not going to come out of it he said In June the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds and as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality Last week the Canadian Wheat Board the marketer of western Canadas wheat durum and barley crops forecast a to percent decline in exports In Ontario Canadas most populous province prime agricultural areas have received only about percent of the precipitation they would normally see You wouldnt be able to fill a sardine can with the rain theyve got since the twentysecond of June said Phillips The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontarios soybean crop I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I dont see it Its just really really really dry said Debbie Yuck a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks When they come on the radio every morning and say its a beautiful sunny day great to be at the cottage I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about hours said Yuck Canadas largest city Toronto has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog with temperatures soaring as high as C F Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling said Phillips a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer The hot dry spell could be a blow to the national economy By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops aiding farmers battling forest fires and generating more electricity it could run into the billions Quebecs multibilliondollar agricultural sector which accounts for some percent of the Canadian industrys revenues and produces percent of the countrys milk has also been hard hit since early July In southern Quebec where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sunravaged crops The farmers are on the edge of burnout they can barely stand up said David StCyr a spokesman for Quebecs powerful Agricultural Union The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that for weeks have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island growers who may lose percent of their crop Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins I think there are a majority of Canadians probably who can hardly wait for the winter And I never thought Id ever hear that said Phillips

thought we paid too much however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home The Houston Texans a very original name have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake Also they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood However home values go up and down just like the stock market Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job I prefer to do it myself I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper One day the contractor almost died in the house he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain however he did this on an empty stomach He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week He ended up returning and finishing the job Anyways I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron All in all I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors Talking about wild flowers and plants the same is true for Costa Rica Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica I recommend that on your places to go list Merry Christmas Feliz Natal and Feliz Navidad Later Paul Original Message From daarontaylor at hotmail dot com ENRON Sent Thursday December PM To Thomas Paul D Subject Re Hello Cher Paul That sounds like a nice marriage When we got married it was nothing extraordinary just a small and informal marriage celebration Yeah I know Braeswood and Buffalo Im sure you paid a pretty penny for the neighbourhood its a nice area Weve done horrendous amounts of work to our apartment We are doing something like a loft with it and we had to gut it by removing most of the walls and floors etc Soon we will be putting in a mezzanine floor its a trendy thing here We had two huge bins full of debris in front of our home for about a week Artisans in France dont like working very much and when they decide to work they do just enough of it to get by so customers are very unsatisfied when they are finished Inevitably the customer must always bargain the price down at the end because more artisans must be hired to come in and finish all that which was not done Its a hell of a mess but to be fair the same problems exist in the States its just that Ive never owned a home before In the end I decided its much easier and faster to do it yourself and bypass the contractor all together Plus you can do a much better job yourself Yes I need to go to Rio Ive been to Hawaii and to date it is the most beautiful place I have ever seen Waikiki has exotic flowers that cost a piece anywhere else growing on the sidewalks like any ordinary flower BTW I was thoroughly impressed with Yosemite Ive been trying to plan a vacation back there ever since we left Kudos Aaron Original Message From To Sent Tuesday December AM Subject RE Hello Well Aaron It is great to hear that you are doing well Yes Raquel and I the same gal I was dating at Genesis ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio We got married in small church on the Lagoa quite a beautiful place to get married Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us My parents family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank We are now considering paying it off however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there Therefore not sure if we really want to pay it off As far as children go we are still waiting for the right time I imagine we will have one in a year or so right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and due to the terrorist attacks Not such a bad place to be stuck I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there It is different from most great cities in the world For example Paris Rome London NYC are all famous for the great buildings etc however Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see as far as a city settings go The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea It is the cidade maravillosa Take care and have a great Christmas

Misra Narsimha Thomas Paul D SubjectNYISO Weekly Update Attached FYI is the weekly update prepared by the NYISO In addition sever al noteworthy actions were taken at Wednesdays Management Committee meetin g ICAP Culminating an month effort that I have been chairing the MC gave final approval to two fundamental changes to NYs ICAP market that if ap proved by FERC would go into effect on Nov with the start of the winter capability period The first changes the nature of determining the p roduct to be bought and sold from one based on tests results ICAP to one that includes as an element a units forced outage rate referred to as u nforced capacity or UCAP The design adopted by NY is very similar to the accreditation system that has been used in PJM for many years It will rew ard units that are more available than the average unit in the state and i ncent the below average units to improve their availability The second maj or change adopted moves NY to a monthly procurement requirement for loads The current requirement is six months at a time The change should facilita te customer switching under retail access programs and avoid the experience just witnessed in upstate NY for this summer capability period where MW of load were deficient and got stuck paying a huge deficiency price for the entire six month period Under the revised program load could cover t heir positions month by month This latter change was approved by the MC ov er the objections of the PSC and certain utilities who continued to argue that any change to the current ICAP rules may damage NYs reliability Penalty and Public Disclosure Provisions In a surprise vote the PSCled e ffort to get the MC to approve additions to the ISOs Market Mitigation Pla n that would add penalty and public disclosure provisions for parties whose bids are mitigated by the ISO was defeated when only voted for the mea sure A vote is required for passage An earlier version of the propo sal had been passed by the MC but had been rejected by the ISO Board becaus e it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to engage in behavior detrimental to the market The PSCled effort to respond to the Boards concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the origina l version to change their vote this time around Whether this effort is res urrected again by the PSCutilities or the Board itself may hinge on what FERC decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before F ERC The ISO Board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer to help it manage price spikes Unbundling of Schedule Charges Efforts to finalize the unbundling of the ISOs fixed schedule charges nearly million a year were sent back to a working group for further work However the direction to be taken fo r some issues appears clear TCCs We succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned to existing TCCs and that if costs are to be assigned to this market the y should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the TCCs compared to the annual auction revenues rather than on the basis of number of TCCs purchased Exports and Wheelthroughs We succeeded in getting a separate category crea ted for these transactions that will result in MWH costs that are much le ss than what is currently charged Conversely there is now likely to be a small charge on imports into NY however since all generation will be hit with this charge it should be reflected in everyones bids equally and sim ply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price The exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a nu mber of issues including whether the TOs should be assessed a portion of th e ISOs overhead right off the top Forwarded by

dating at Genesis ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio We got married in small church on the Lagoa quite a beautiful place to get married Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us My parents family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank We are now considering paying it off however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there Therefore not sure if we really want to pay it off As far as children go we are still waiting for the right time I imagine we will have one in a year or so right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and due to the terrorist attacks Not such a bad place to be stuck I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there It is different from most great cities in the world For example Paris Rome London NYC are all famous for the great buildings etc however Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see as far as a city settings go The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea It is the cidade maravillosa Take care and have a great
