M nron Subject ISU and IP Tim and Marc I have looked over Conrad Siudylas May letter to you and have the following comments First he is patently threatening the customer and Enron that if the selfgen units are parallel or regularly run as peak shavers IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the contract Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us It is imperative that we have our rights straight First that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel Second that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the ICC and Third that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its selfgen units as peak shavers Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer that the units are truly isolated The customer will need to run its units to peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the Commission now We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IPs tariffs in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customers and hence Enrons as agent rights under the tariffs

Services From Eric G Pitcher PM Phone No To Tim ES Roy ES cc Marc ES Janine nron Susan M nron David ES Subject ISU and IP Roy and Tim if we decide to go to the ICC need to brief my mgmt on the following Potential impact on our contractual obligations to ISU given the various actions that IP may take eg retroactive change of tariif Potential financial impact to EES given the various actions IP may take Ill see Bob Hurt on Mon in Houston and will brief him on the situation Thanks Forwarded by Eric G PitcherHOUEES on PM From Roy Boston on PM To Tim ES Marc ES cc Eric G ES Janine nron Susan M nron Subject ISU and IP Tim and Marc I have looked over Conrad Siudylas May letter to you and have the following comments First he is patently threatening the customer and Enron that if the selfgen units are parallel or regularly run as peak shavers IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the contract Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us It is imperative that we have our rights straight First that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel Second that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the ICC and Third that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its selfgen units as peak shavers Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer that the units are truly isolated The customer will need to run its units to peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the Commission now We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IPs tariffs in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customers and hence Enrons as agent rights under the tariffs Embedded StdOleLink
