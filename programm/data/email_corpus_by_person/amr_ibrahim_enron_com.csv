standpoint the answer is No for the reasons discussed below However as we know the PX will take a contrary position and has along with other California parties taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC to secure payment of refunds due May we replace the letters of credit with cash other collateral The answer is Yes as you note below with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX Obviously cash should be acceptable Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option What is the potential outcome if we do nothing ie we dont reup the letters of credit Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration As for additional options we could consider Further to Steves option we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head

Thanks Ray Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Tuesday November PM To Alvarez Ray Subject RE I agree Schedule section says Each PX Participant shall post collateral for of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets I would note that our requirements are currently zero and we do not wish nor is it possible to participate in the CTS and Core Markets Therefore the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral As you indicated below Schedule section says Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the DayAhead and DayOf markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled Options If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday then let

of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral the purpose of which however is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets Since these

let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX FERC Electric Service Tariff Art a summary could be prepared if needed I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art and the associated schedule of the tariff related to Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount As Steve mentioned nicely below if the security amount is zero then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund On the same theme I am investigating the requirements for maintaining ESP electricity service provider in California One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for some transactions then there is a circular flow in the argument and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX I shall keep you posted with progress Brgrds AI Original Message From Alvarez Ray

Forwarded by Amr IbrahimENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Amr Ibrahim AM To Richard nron cc James D nron Subject India Progress Report One Rick This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and short talks with the various colleagues in India Team I do have a meeting with Wade tomorrow June th to understand his requests of support from GA While I do not expect much I shall communicate to Wade the standing policy of GA namely GA shall provide the required support Notwithstanding this mandate I shall communicate it in a manner to give Houston the final say In the context of regulatory support there two important areas for GA contribution they are a Dealing with the regulatory commission MERC and b third party sales It is likely that India shall need a week per month most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA and exit India but see point below It is the understanding that there are teams in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract MSEB has to agree on the valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process It is noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in Singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want ENRON to complete phase II which we are refusing If renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to Phase II MW kit and caboodle NTPC or PTC are the likely parties to assume such responsibility Of course we are trying to avoid any commercial risks associated with marketing this power Whether we accept it or not every issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and solved The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest level that is directly from RMcDonald and JS The fact that both of them did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point Perhaps this point should be communicated to them As mentioned above GA contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission MERC and third party sales Starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally Enrons commitment in the project is between and billionwith Bdepending on what to include and exclude Ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added As for dealing with MERC it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice I shall keep you

standing policy of GA namely GA shall provide the required support Notwithstanding this mandate I shall communicate it in a manner to give Houston the final say In the context of regulatory support there two important areas for GA contribution they are a Dealing with the regulatory commission MERC and b third party sales It is likely that India shall need a week per month most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA and exit India but see point below It is the understanding that there are teams in London that

noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in Singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want ENRON to complete phase II which we are refusing If renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to Phase II MW kit and

The fact that both of them did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point Perhaps this point should be communicated to them As mentioned above GA contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission MERC and third party sales Starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally Enrons commitment in the project is between and billionwith Bdepending on what to include and exclude Ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are

very noisily Ken Ley and possibly Jeff are expected here in India in the week of July th No confirmation as of yet Perhaps you would like to consider that you and I are to be here too I expect to have

that all is well It was very nice to talk to you this morning The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining the GA needs for India and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade I look forward for your comments and advise Best regards AI Here are the salient features Meeting with Wade The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front He indicated that if GA sees and agrees he would be happy to financeon a semi full time basissuch support from Houston His major concern is to satisfy himself that a all what needs to be done on the GA front is being done b manage and maintain an effective team ie those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices just in case of need He mentioned that he is not going to be penny wise and pound foolish given the million at stake I informed him that Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete and generally speaking shall also deliver on what is needed GA Needs in India The regulatorygovernment affairs needs in India are in the following five areas a Third party Sales basically for phase II output b Dealing with the Regulatory Commission c Dealing with MSEB the customer e Government of India and f EBS The volume and intensity of work however shall differ with the following scenarios namely a EnronDPC intends to exit through arbitration b EnronDPC intends to renegotiate the contract and c Undetermined as of yet Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios Arbitration Renegotiation Third party Sales basically for phase II output lowmedium high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission medium high Dealing with MSEB the customer medium high Government of India and high high EBS medium medium It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that EnronDPC seems to be taking the arbitration route although that renegotiation in the sense of renegotiate stabilize then take hit on equity and exit is the best way It is more surprising however that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going In this context a riskaverse person shall take the undetermined scenario as equal to renegotiation while a risktaker shall take the undetermined as equal to arbitration Personal It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in the renegotiation scenario on a semi full time basis Short of that a visit every weeks may be adequate as the current team here will be working under legalcommercial Suggested Approach Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming to days If the above opinion is still the same then the suggested communication to Wade preferably from you is if there is renegotiation then GA shall send the required personpersons on a semifull time basis if arbitration then GA shall be available on as needed basis Caveat It is not clear what does RMcDonald

Rick I hope that all is well It was very nice to talk to you this morning The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining the GA needs for India and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade I look forward for your comments and advise Best regards AI Here are the salient features Meeting with Wade The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front He indicated that if GA sees and agrees he would be happy to financeon a semi full time basissuch support from Houston His major concern is to satisfy himself that a all what needs to be done on the GA front is being done b manage and maintain an effective team ie those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices just in case of need He mentioned that he is not going to be penny wise and pound foolish given the million at stake I informed him that Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete and generally speaking shall also deliver on what is needed GA Needs in India The regulatorygovernment affairs needs in India are in the following five areas a Third party Sales basically for phase II output b Dealing with the Regulatory Commission c Dealing with MSEB the customer e Government of India and f EBS The volume and intensity of work however shall differ with the following scenarios namely a EnronDPC intends to exit through arbitration b EnronDPC intends to renegotiate the contract and c Undetermined as of yet Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios Arbitration Renegotiation Third party Sales basically for phase II output lowmedium high Dealing with the Regulatory Commission medium high Dealing with MSEB the customer medium high Government of India and high high EBS medium medium It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that EnronDPC seems to be taking the arbitration route although that renegotiation in the sense of renegotiate stabilize then take hit on equity and exit is the best way It is more surprising however that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going In this context a riskaverse person shall take the undetermined scenario as equal to renegotiation while a risktaker shall take the undetermined as equal to arbitration Personal It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in the renegotiation scenario on a semi full time basis Short of that a visit every weeks may be adequate as the current team here will be working under legalcommercial Suggested Approach Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming to days If the above opinion is still the same then the suggested communication to Wade preferably from you is if there is renegotiation then GA shall send the required personpersons on a semifull time basis if arbitration then GA shall be available on as needed basis Caveat It

James D nron Subject India Progress Report One Rick This is a brief on the situation on the ground here based on observations and short talks with the various colleagues in India Team I do have a meeting with Wade tomorrow June th to understand his requests of support from GA While I do not expect much I shall communicate to Wade the standing policy of GA namely GA shall provide the required support Notwithstanding this mandate I shall communicate it in a manner to give Houston the final say In the context of regulatory support there two important areas for GA contribution they are a Dealing with the regulatory commission MERC and b third party sales It is likely that India shall need a week per month most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA and exit India but see point below It is the understanding that there are teams in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract MSEB has to agree on the valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process It is noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in Singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want ENRON to complete phase II which we are refusing If renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to Phase II MW kit and caboodle NTPC or PTC are the likely parties to assume such responsibility Of course we are trying to avoid any commercial risks associated with marketing this power Whether we accept it or not every issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and solved The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest level that is directly from RMcDonald and JS The fact that both of them did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point Perhaps this point should be communicated to them As mentioned above GA contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission MERC and third party sales Starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally Enrons commitment in the project is between and billionwith Bdepending on what to include and exclude Ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added As for dealing with MERC it an ongoing basis

progress in determining the GA needs for India and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade I look forward for your comments and advise Best regards AI Here are the salient features Meeting with Wade The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs to be done on the regulatory front He indicated that if GA sees and agrees he would be happy to financeon a semi full time basissuch support from Houston His major concern is to satisfy himself that a all what needs to be done on the GA front is being done b manage and maintain an effective team ie those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices just in case of need He mentioned that he is not going to be penny wise and pound foolish given the million at stake I informed him that Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is complete and generally speaking shall also deliver on what is needed GA Needs in India The regulatorygovernment affairs needs in India are in the following five areas a Third party Sales basically for phase II output b Dealing with the Regulatory Commission c Dealing with MSEB the customer e Government of India and f EBS The volume and intensity of work however shall differ with the following scenarios namely a EnronDPC intends to exit through arbitration b EnronDPC intends to renegotiate the contract and c Undetermined as of yet Here is an

Dealing with MSEB the customer medium high Government of India and high high EBS medium medium It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that EnronDPC seems to be taking the arbitration route although that renegotiation in the sense of renegotiate stabilize then take hit on equity and exit is the best way It is more surprising however that no one can speak with any degree of certainty on where the ship is going In this context a riskaverse person shall take the undetermined scenario as equal to renegotiation while a risktaker shall take the undetermined as equal to arbitration Personal It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in the renegotiation scenario on a semi full time basis Short of that a visit every weeks may be adequate as the current team here will be working under legalcommercial Suggested Approach Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for the coming to days If the above opinion is still the same then the suggested communication to Wade preferably from you is if there is renegotiation then GA shall send the required personpersons on a semifull time basis if

talks with the various colleagues in India Team I do have a meeting with Wade tomorrow June th to understand his requests of support from GA While I do not expect much I shall communicate to Wade the standing policy of GA namely GA shall provide the required support Notwithstanding this mandate I shall communicate it in a manner to give Houston the final say In the context of regulatory support there two important areas for GA contribution they are a Dealing with the regulatory commission MERC and b third party sales It is likely that India shall need a week per month most conducted from Houston but may include a visit to Bombay The feeling here is that the company wants to terminate the PPA and exit India but see point below It is the understanding that there are teams in London that are going through the reevaluation of assets in anticipation to transfer them to MSEB as per the contract MSEB has to agree on the valuation which shall be a lengthy and an adversarial process It is noteworthy that the transfer of these assets will not take place on market basis but rather on accounting basis As most chips are on terminating the contracts and exiting as the likely route around renegotiation is not discussed much hastily added however renegotiation is the tacit direction of the lenders as communicated in Singapore the other day in the lenders meeting they also want ENRON to complete phase II which we are refusing If renegotiation is to take place its crux will be the reduction in energy and capacity costs to both phases and finding offtaker to Phase II MW kit and caboodle NTPC or PTC are the likely parties to assume such responsibility Of course we are trying to avoid any commercial risks associated with marketing this power Whether we accept it or not every issue related to dispatch and transmission must be minutely determined and solved The decision making process here is entirely dependent on Houston highest level that is directly from RMcDonald and JS The fact that both of them did not visit India and see for themselves how things are has been mentioned as a minus point Perhaps this point should be communicated to them As mentioned above GA contribution could be in two areas namely dealing the regulatory commission MERC and third party sales Starting with the later third party sales it is perhaps the most important point in the renegotiation as it shall increase the commercial value of our commitment incidentally Enrons commitment in the project is between and billionwith Bdepending on what to include and exclude Ironing the issues for third party sales is clearly more valuable in the case of renegotiation but can also add value when assets are reevaluated and there is a disagreement and some sort of market parameters are added As for dealing with MERC it an ongoing basis particularly that MERC is seeking to expand its jurisdiction in favor MSEB at every through of the dice I shall keep you posted with progress

information Brgrds AI Original Message From Ogenyi Gloria Sent Thursday November PM To Bradford William S Kingerski Harry Hughes Evan Fite Rebecca Frederking William Tribolet Michael Gorte David Gahn Scott Wood James M Dietrich Janet Ibrahim Amr Steffes James D Shapiro Richard Nicolay Christi L Herndon Rogers Sharp Greg Merola Jeff Bertasi Ron Hetrick Nancy Dietrich Sarah Cc Buerger Rubena Barnes Lynnette Subject IMPORTANT Illinois Creditworthiness Issues Unlike TX creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers ARES in IL is not uniform accross utility lines The creditworthiness standards vary by utility and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES However the single billing option SBO has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative Enrons Credit Rating of BBBSP and BaaMoodys General Creditworthiness Under Section Subchapter C of the IL Admin Code as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement In IL EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of MW or more To secure this license EES was required to post bond in the sum of The bond is valid for one year and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES If the license bond is cancelled modified expires or is drawn upon EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount The EES license bond expired on June EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June and annually thereafter Registration Under SubPart B EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only nonresidential customers with maximum demand of MW or more Subpart B has additional financial qualifications To maintain certification under Subpart B EES needs to maintain at least one of the following longterm credit ratings of BBB SP Baa Moodys BBB Duff Phelps or BBB Fitch or Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall not be less than or of EES revenue for last fiscal year or Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in an amount not less than or of EESs revenue for the last fiscal year or Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES contractual failure This certification shall be covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in the sum of times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next months multiplied by the average of the highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year or EES maintains a line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of or of its revenue for last fiscal year from an A rated financial insitution or EES earns points on the financial ratios pretax interest coverage funds from operations interest coverage funds from operations to total debt and total debt to total capital Enrons Credit Rating and downgrades To satisfy the Subpart B requirements EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp Given our current credit rating of BBBSP and Baa Moodys that guaranty is still valid However if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness IMPACT The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EESs ability to do business in IL Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical Please note that EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP Single Bill Option Pursuant to Section Subpart F any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option SBO must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities monies that it collects under the SBO tariff To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards EES must either Post and maintain bond in the amount of of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an A rating Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings a BBB SP Baa Moodys BBBduff Phelps BBB Fitch Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings Enrons Current Rating EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings EES is not rated However given Enron Corps current credit rating of BBB and Baa a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff Further Downgrades If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings EES will need to provide a bond or LC or forego the SBO option IMPACT EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical However there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables Instrument Fund Charges akin to stranded costs Under the Illinois tariffs EES can choose annually one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges To remit IFC charges within days of receipt of customer payment or more frequently as required or within days of utility invoicing whether or not customer has paid If EES chooses the nd option it has to provide a security deposit equal to one months estimated IFC charges for all EES customers Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage and the IFC charge per KWH If the expected IFC charge for EES customers is or more this deposit amount will be revised monthly If EES chooses the nd option remittance of bills within days of utility invoicing we will be required to provide the deposit IMPACT This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd For ComEd IFC charges nets out to zero and customers do not pay those charges EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IPs service territory and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement However this may have operational implications

zero then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund On the same theme I am investigating the requirements for maintaining ESP electricity service provider in California One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for some transactions then there is a circular flow in the argument and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX I shall keep you posted with progress Brgrds AI Original Message From Alvarez Ray Sent Tuesday November PM To Hall Steve C Legal Cc Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Sager Elizabeth Ibrahim Amr Subject CalPX Collateral Issue Thanks Steve With your input my take on Elizabeths questions are Must we renew the collateral From a legal standpoint the answer is No for the reasons discussed below However as we know the PX will take a contrary position and has along with other California parties taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC to secure payment of refunds due May we replace the letters of credit with cash other collateral The answer is Yes as you note below with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX Obviously cash should be acceptable Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option What is the potential outcome if we do nothing ie we dont reup the letters of credit Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration As for additional options we could consider Further to Steves option we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head Steves original option is preferable however since it is through agreement with the PX Perhaps a compromise could be proposed for the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refund liability to the PX in the CA refund case Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the letter of credit Elizabeth please advise if this answers your questions fully Thanks Ray Original Message From Hall Steve C Legal Sent Tuesday November PM To Alvarez Ray Subject RE I agree Schedule section says Each PX Participant shall post collateral for of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets I would note that our requirements are currently zero and we do not wish nor is it possible to participate in the CTS and Core Markets Therefore the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral As you indicated below Schedule section says Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the DayAhead and DayOf markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled Options If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday then let them cash in the LC Ask the PX if we can substitute other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX in lieu of cash Schedule section We should ask them what else would be acceptable a lien on Jeff Skillings house Original Message From Alvarez Ray Sent Tuesday November AM To Hall Steve C Legal Cc Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Sager Elizabeth Subject RE Steve I believe that schedule section of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral the purpose of which however is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets Since these
