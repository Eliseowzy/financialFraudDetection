<6504646.1075862289543.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mariella.mahan@enron.com,2001-11-13 12:53:54,Confidential Decision tree on projectsSomething for us to talk about during our next staff meeting There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations these are SECLP Panama and Gaz a In the past as I suppose we have done in Dabhol we have taken the pos ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans SECLP has be en the biggest issueproblem Panama is much less a few million of floati ng of our receivables from the company would be sufficient to meet the cas h crunch in April of this year Note that in Panama the debt is fully gu aranteed by the government and is nonrecoursed to the operating company B LM In the past we have discussed letting the debt default which would c ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th e GoPanama The reason the vast majority of BLMs problems stem from acti ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPAs with pri vate parties those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues which although today have stopped or have been limited have left a mark on th e companys liquidity position Now the question is come April of should any of our actions in Panam a or decisions related thereto which we would have otherwise taken or made be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro n to preserve efforts to reestablish investorcreditor confidence The sa me could go for SECLP and Gaza This is simply an overall guidance question Lets take it up during our staff meeting next week if thats ok with you Many thanks Mariella
