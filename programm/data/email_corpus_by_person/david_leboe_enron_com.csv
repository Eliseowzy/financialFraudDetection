filing on Mondaymore stellar leadership from the administration Biggest news is that the Governor is now frantically trying to cobble together a Tx buyout deal with Edison Sempra but note that Burton in this story questions whether it makes sense to buy Tx if PGE isnt part of the deal The first hearing on the bankruptcy is today Governor Utility In War Of Words Davis furious as PGE defends bankruptcy filing David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Monday April San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchiveM NDTL Californias energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov Gray Davis and Pacific Gas and Electric Co traded barbs over who is to blame for the bankruptcy of the states largest utility In a series of titfortat statements each side laid claim to the moral high ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in response to The Chronicles report Saturday that PGE awarded million in bonuses and raises to employees just hours before Fridays bankruptcy filing PGEs management is suffering from two afflictions denial and greed Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night In a testy reply PGE countered that instead of focusing all his attention on solving the states yearlong and everworsening energy crisis the governor has launched a campaignstyle attack on our company PGE said Davis was criticizing thousands of men and women who have worked tirelessly and professionally through this crisis and concluded that California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention to the crisis at hand Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor fired back yesterday PGE waged a public relations war on Friday If theyre looking for somebody to blame they should look in the mirror Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord with Southern California Edison Co for the state to purchase the cash strapped companys power lines for nearly billion A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night There are a few remaining details to be worked out but it seems pretty close Maviglio said adding that an announcement of the deal could come as early as today The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility he said Along with the Edison deal Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PGEs bankruptcy bombshell Efforts to stabilize Californias dysfunctional electricity market suddenly have become much more complex NOT MUCH CHANGED Nevertheless while PGEs bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect of Californias longdrawnout energy mess at the end of the day it doesnt really change a thing Consider PGEs financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs That rate freeze and skyhigh electricity prices remain in place Californias energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not having built any major power plants for the past years PGEs bankruptcy does nothing to affect that precarious situation PGEs foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that electricity demand is outpacing available supply California consumers still face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer The crux of the problem is still the same said Loretta Lynch president of the state Public Utilities Commission We face the same challenges we did before PGE filed for bankruptcy She added however that PGEs bankruptcy increases the uncertainty The utility doesnt see it that way PGE spokesman Ron Low said Californias energy woes are no more uncertain now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to find an equitable solution to the states troubles California remains in an energy crisis he said As we head toward summer resources are going to be very tight WHAT COULD HAPPEN In the short run consumers will notice no change whatsoever Bankruptcy protection will allow PGE to continue operating as usual while the companys creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills Longer term there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PGE that conditions for lifting the rate freeze were met a year ago and that billion in subsequent expenses must be borne by consumers How much peoples bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is structured It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing fees but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost over a number of years The big question mark now is how PGEs bankruptcy will affect various political and legislative measures intended to keep Californias lights on The states attempt to purchase PGEs power lines is obviously finished although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court Meanwhile the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energys San Diego utility although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be determined Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra and not PGE asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco I dont know the answer to that A final accord with Edison this week would validate PGEs apparent concerns that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was unveiled The Chronicle quoted PGE insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to file for bankruptcy had been made early last week even though senior company officials said the move followed the governors Thursday night speech on solving Californias energy issues One reason PGE opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with Edison was expected at any time observers said Paul Patterson an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston noted that if PGE had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state they would be seen as a spoiler ENSUING CONFUSION In any case PGEs surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for footing in the changed political landscape Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the states political and corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said all this fingerpointing will do nothing to ensure that Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the public she said Email David Lazarus at San Francisco

more complex NOT MUCH CHANGED Nevertheless while PGEs bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect of Californias longdrawnout energy mess at the end of the day it doesnt really change a thing Consider PGEs financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs That rate freeze and skyhigh electricity prices remain in place Californias energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not having built any major power plants for the past years PGEs bankruptcy does nothing to affect that precarious situation PGEs foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that electricity demand is outpacing available supply California consumers still face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer The crux of the problem is still the same said Loretta Lynch president of the state Public Utilities Commission We face the same challenges we did before PGE filed for bankruptcy She added however that PGEs bankruptcy increases the uncertainty The utility doesnt see it that way PGE spokesman Ron Low said Californias energy woes are no more uncertain now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to find an equitable solution to the states troubles California remains in an energy crisis he said As we head toward summer resources are going to be very tight WHAT COULD HAPPEN In the short run consumers will notice no change whatsoever Bankruptcy protection will allow PGE to continue operating as usual while the companys creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills Longer term there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PGE that conditions for lifting the rate freeze were met a year ago and that billion in subsequent expenses must be borne by consumers How much peoples bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is structured It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing fees but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost over a number of years The big question mark now is how PGEs bankruptcy will affect various political and legislative measures intended to keep Californias lights on The states attempt to purchase PGEs power lines is obviously finished although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court Meanwhile the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energys San Diego utility although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be determined Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra and not PGE asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco I dont know the answer to that A final accord with Edison this week would validate PGEs apparent concerns that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was unveiled The Chronicle quoted PGE insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to file for bankruptcy had been made early last week even though senior company officials said the move followed the governors Thursday night speech on solving Californias energy issues One reason PGE opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with Edison was expected at any time observers said Paul Patterson an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston noted that if PGE had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state they would be seen as a spoiler ENSUING CONFUSION In any case PGEs surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for footing in the changed political landscape Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the states political and corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said all this fingerpointing will do nothing to ensure that Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the public she said Email David Lazarus at San Francisco
