of our office met with you a week or so ago and mentioned that we would need advice from you regarding the use of our internet trading website with customers in Japan Below is a list of initial questions regarding which we would be grateful for the benefit of your advice For your background information as you consider these questions be advised that counterparties must sign a written Password Application which provides that the counterparty intends to be bound by agreements entered into by clicking in the appropriate spaces on the website Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have I can be reached either by email at or by telephone at Have relevant regulators in your jurisdiction made any statements regarding marketing of or dealing in any of the following types of products through the internet or other electronic systems Commodity transactions relating to oil gas electricity or other energy commodities whether derivative transactions cash settled or physically settled Financial derivatives ie interest rate foreign exchange or credit derivatives Weather derivatives If so please could you provide us with a brief summary Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection with the marketing or dealing in the above types of products through the internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source We will let you know if we find any previous or future statements Do any specific laws or regulations exist in your jurisdiction which would prevent or in any way impact upon marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet In answering this question please address issues relating to contractual formation and enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet In particular if a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law will such transactions including the choice of law be enforceable in Japan We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question above through the internet Under Japanese law formation of any contract does not require any formality Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such There is no Statute of Frauds and parties may make most types of contracts orally If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered an offeror may rely on it In most simple sales contracts for consumer goods for example it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y The Sellers electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy product Y should be enough in this context In more complicated contracts the structure of the sellers Web pages should be carefully designed Having no court decisions we have no definite answer to the question of enforceability of shrinkwrap agreements in Japan However the legal implications of the Webwrap the online version of shrinkwrap may be somewhat different from shrinkwraps eg licenses for software sold over the counter Under a typical shrinkwrap license in the real world for example the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product However in an online environment a customer has a choice to click on an AccepttoBuy icon before the customer purchases the product Further with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrinkwrap license situation Unlike shrinkwrap in the real world the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon Given these differences the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrinkwrap licenses If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under US or UK law and the transactions contain a choice of such law such transactions including the choice of law will be enforceable in Japan If the answer to either of question or is yes please indicate whether the impact of any relevant statements laws or regulations will differ depending upon whether a the relevant internet site is maintained in your jurisdiction or elsewhere or b the party effecting the marketingtrading through the internet is locally licensed NA Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with counterparts in your jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory bodieslocal laws or regulations will not consider the party maintaining the relevant website to have established a physical establishmentbranch in your jurisdiction We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws regulations or court cases So long as the party maintains the relevant website with a computer server located outside Japan the likelihood of Japanese regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website established a physical establishmentbranch in Japan is negligible Thank you in advance for your attention We look forward to hearing from you Sincerely Mark Taylor
