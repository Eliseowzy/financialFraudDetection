April FERC order Implementation date is May per the FERC order not June as I indicated in the MIF meeting Gas prices will be available in the new OASIS site starting am on May See If for some reason OASIS is not able to publish the prices we will be sending out the prices via email to all market participants andor system messages display in the SI workspace Replacing the bids for gasfired generators with proxy bids during mitigation hours We will determine mitigation hours by checking system status between and minutes before the start of an operating hour The decision will apply for a whole hour We will not operate hours partially under mitigation and partially under nonmitigation A report indicating which hours are mitigation hours will be published on the new OASIS site The latest status will be posted at the top of each operating hour For generators in the control area only that we have visibility to individually scheduled unit gross metering we will be checking for available capacity and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity The bids for the additional energy will be priced on the proxy curve Extending or inserting bids for mustoffer generators by the ISO For generators in the control area only that we have visibility to individually scheduled unit gross metering we will be checking for available capacity and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity The bids for the additional energy will be priced at Units awarded regulation will not be subject to ISO capacity checking and therefore not subject to bid extending or inserting If a unit has not submitted a supplemental energy bid we will only generate a new Supp Energy bid for that unit if it appears to be available and dispatchable during realtime In order to facilitate that we are using the following criteria the unit is a combustion turbine the unit has a nonzero hour ahead schedule or the unit has been awarded ancillary services Submittal of single Heat Rate and Emission Rate points or no points For those units that have only submitted data for one operating point and are capable of generating over multiple operating ranges or in general cases where we believe the data to be inadequate we will substitute the operating points with the data from current or preexisting RMR contracts where possible If RMR data does not exist for a unit we reserve the right to use other data from other sources to replace the submitted data For those units that have not submitted any data we will assume the unit is a price taker and generate proxy bids at For those of you trying to cover your GMMs A SC asked about what happens when they have to overgenerate above their Hour Ahead schedule to cover their GMM and then we dispatch them the difference between Pmax and their HA schedule to comply with the FERC order Example SC has a MW unit Their GMM is or about MW of losses They usually submit an HA schedule of MW and generate at MW to cover the GMM The answer is that A unit that keeps the ISO apprised of its availability in realtime and performs in accordance with its bid characteristics when dispatched should not receive penalties A unit with a Final HA Schedule of MW that is dispatched for the additional MW and generates MW according to meter data will not be penalized under CT The Total Obligation for CT for a unit that is dispatched for Incremental Energy is Final HA Schedule of Instructed Incremental Energy The Total Obligation for the hour is compared to the hourly meter value for that unit and is not adjusted for transmission losses ie GMM is not taken into account Currently penalties for failure to perform are assessed on an hourly basis however CT may be assessed on an interval basis in the future So the Total Obligation for the unit is MW MW of MW MW which is less than the meter of MW For CT purposes this unit will not receive any penalties It is important to note that there is a tolerance or MW for Instructed Energy less than MW on CT penalties If the unit is instructed for less than MW MW will be taken off of the Instructed Incremental Energy instead of This means that any unit that has an Incremental Instruction for MW or less would not be flagged for CT review For other Settlement charge types such as CT and No Pay charges on Spin NonSpin and Replacement a unit is required to provide the Instructed Energy plus any transmission losses in order to receive full credit for providing the Scheduled Energy and
