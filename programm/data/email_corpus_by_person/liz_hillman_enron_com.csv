analyst at Fahnestock Co After all this are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy San Franciscobased ChevronTexaco said it has a vested interest in Dynegys success but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take The company owns percent of Dynegy a stake that has lost nearly threequarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week even

Dynegys credit rating in on review while rival credit agency Standard Poors has placed Dynegys short and longterm credit ratings on CreditWatch If Dynegy is downgraded to junk theyll have to raise

Dynegy said James Elliot a portfolio manager with Dominick Dominick Advisors Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegys board including Chief Financial Officer John Watson It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing said Gheit I
