Oil Futures Strip up Natural Gas HHUB up Month Natural Gas Futures Strip up Residual Oil on a MMBtu basis up London Crude Oil down so far this morning Energy Stocks Could See Weakness Over Next Month Present Buying Opportunity From a technical analysis standpoint the oilservice group looks like it will trade sideways to down over the next month On the fundamental analysis side there are no visible positive catalysts expected until July when we should see a rollover in API inventories lower natural gas injections with warmer weather and further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter natural gas production data While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum inventories into July it has experienced largerthanexpected builds over the past few weeks The energy market is likely to view this as a very bearish sign We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible days ago before it cut off AprilMay exports in protest to the US and Israel Bottom line The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next weeks Based upon strong longerterm to month fundamentals however we believe investors should take advantage of any potential weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of meaningful yearend upside The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased MMBbls to MMBbls for the week ended May The average consensus range called for a MMBbl draw to a MMBbl build in total inventories This build in total inventories is very bearish for the oil market Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude supplies as well as greater distillate supplies Total petroleum inventories are currently MMBbls above levels one year ago and continues to climb above the fiveyear average Motor gasoline inventories decreased by MMBbls to MMBbls last week and are now MMBbls above last year at this time Distillate fuel inventories rose by MMBbls to MMBbls last week Distillate inventories are now MMBbls above last year at this time US refinery operations were at a utilization rate which was higher than last weeks rate and much higher than expectations of an increase Total petroleum imports decreased slightly to MMBblsday OILSERVICE Nabors Reincorporation

show strength on cold weather forecastshort covering Last week Bcf was withdrawn from storage compared to Bcf last year and expectations for a Bcf withdrawal Total storage is now Bcf which is above last year This weeks report showed Bcfd less gas available for storage relative to last year on a weatheradjusted basis The nearmonth March futures contract showed some strength this week after the National Weather Service NWS forecasted colderthannormal weather in several key consuming regions during the next weeks Additionally short covering by traders probably added to the positive momentum The contract traded as high as MMBtu this week before slipping to MMBtu after the AGAs report To reach Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional withdrawal season approximately Bcfweek would have to be pulled from storage on average over the last six weeks This compares to approximately Bcfweek withdrawn during the same period last year under normal temperatures As a result of the NWSs forecast is accurate we could still hit the Bcf mark However if weather remains warmer than normal the probability of withdrawing that much gas decreases substantially Longerterm we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals will be a supply driven equation Based on fourth quarter production volumes reported so far it appears that US natural gas production will in fact show both sequential and yeartoyear declines Despite the potential for nearterm weakness in prices we remain bullish on the intermediate and longerterm fundamentals for natural gas The American Petroleum Institute API reported that total petroleum inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls for the week ended February The consensus range called for a MMBbl build to a MMBbl build This is a bullish report for the oil market Total petroleum inventories are currently MMBbls above levels one year ago Crude oil inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls last week Crude oil inventories are MMBbls above last

operations were at a utilization rate which was higher than last weeks rate Total Petroleum imports decreased to MMBblsday Despite last weeks larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum inventories the slowdown in US economic growth that was exacerbated by the September terrorist attacks has continued to weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well above our year average OILSERVICE BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition Yesterday BJ Services NYSEBJSStrong Buy announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA Inc NASDAQOSCA for per share a premium to the preannouncement stock price This allcash deal equates to a total purchase price of roughly million and is expected to close by the end of the second calendar quarter OSCA provides a full array of completionrelated products and services including completion fluids completion tools and completion services BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental products services and markets across its existing asset and customer base to yield significant pullthrough revenue opportunities down the road While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA the combination makes a lot of strategic sense Following the announced acquisition we are making slight modifications to our nearterm estimates Specifically we are shaving a nickel from our existing FY estimate bringing it down to per share This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition without significant nearterm cost savings or pull through benefits As management indicated on its conference call it expects the deal to be accretive to the FY consensus of per share by to per share Since we are already in print at we are leaving our FY estimates unchanged in order to be conservative Given the expected slight accretion to FY earnings combined with potential longerterm upside and an improving market outlook we are maintaining our Strong Buy rating and month target price of per share Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely undervalued relative to its peers Following yesterdays acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services it is even more clear now that Tetra Technologies NYSETTIStrong Buy is cheap Specifically OSCA was purchased for between x EPS or x EBITDA If we apply those multiples to TTI we come up with a value of to per share as opposed to the current price of per share The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA only perhaps not as well known Following OSCAs acquisition there remains a chance that TTI could be taken out at some point in time although we have no reason to believe it will be soon Furthermore TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of this transaction Finally the company reported fourth quarter EPS of per share a penny above consensus It will host a conference call today at am ET The dial in number is Unit Corp handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations Unit Corp NYSEUNTStrong Buy reported fourth quarter earnings of per share compared to per share in the fourth quarter of This result was ahead of the consensus estimate of per share Revenues for the quarter came in at million down approximately from last year and down from the third quarter Likewise overall operating margins were down over basis points yeartoyear to about while they were also down a like amount on a sequential basis The strong quarterly results were largely a result of strongerthanexpected dayrates utilization and margins during the quarter In fact average dayrates were down by only about to just under per day Meanwhile average realized oil and natural gas prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with declines on a yeartoyear basis of for oil and for gas Production volumes also decreased from last year by for oil and for natural gas Despite the generally strong results drilling activity has fallen dramatically over the past couple months This drop in overall rig activity has had a significant impact on Units utilization dropping from a quarterly average of nearly rigs in Q to the current runrate of pulling dayrates down another currently Due to declines in the nearterm outlook for drilling and production combined with Units current activity indicators dayrates utilization production and commodity prices we are adjusting our quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates Accordingly we are maintaining our estimate of per share and our estimate of per share Despite the lack of nearterm visibility the improving longterm outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy rating with a month target price of per share based on a blended average of three valuation techniques Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss Conrad Industries NASDAQCNRDStrong Buy reported its fourth quarter of a loss of per share compared to a profit of per share in the fourth quarter of This results missed the consensus estimate by per share Revenues for

and down almost basis points sequentially The backlog at quarterend stood at million down from the fourth quarter of but up from last quarter The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on

Futures Strip down Natural Gas HHUB down Month Natural Gas Futures Strip unchanged Residual Oil on a Mcf basis up London Crude Oil up so far this morning AGA reports inline injection gas prices surge show strength on cold weather forecastshort covering Last week Bcf was withdrawn from storage compared to Bcf last year and expectations for a Bcf withdrawal Total storage is now Bcf which is above last year This weeks report showed Bcfd less gas available for storage relative to last year on a weatheradjusted basis The nearmonth March futures contract showed some strength this week after the National Weather Service NWS forecasted colderthannormal weather in several key consuming regions during the next weeks Additionally short covering by traders probably added to the positive momentum The contract traded as high as MMBtu this week before slipping to MMBtu after the AGAs report To reach Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional withdrawal season approximately Bcfweek would have to be pulled from storage on average over the last six weeks This compares to approximately Bcfweek withdrawn during the same period last year under normal temperatures As a result of the NWSs forecast is accurate we could still hit the Bcf mark However if weather remains warmer than normal the probability of withdrawing that much gas decreases substantially Longerterm we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals will be a supply driven equation Based on fourth quarter production volumes reported so far it appears that US natural gas production will in fact show both sequential and yeartoyear declines Despite the potential for nearterm weakness in prices we remain bullish on the intermediate and longerterm fundamentals for natural gas The American Petroleum Institute API reported that total petroleum inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls for the week ended February The consensus range called for a MMBbl build to a MMBbl build This is a bullish report for the oil market Total petroleum inventories are currently MMBbls above levels one year ago Crude oil inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls last week Crude oil inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time Based on our current US crude oil demand estimate there are approximately days of crude oil inventory Motor gasoline inventories increased MMBbl to MMBbls last week Motor gasoline inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time Distillate fuel inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls last week Distillate inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time US refinery operations were at a utilization rate which was higher than last weeks rate Total Petroleum imports decreased to MMBblsday Despite last weeks larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum inventories the slowdown in US economic growth that was exacerbated by the September terrorist attacks has continued to weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well above our year average OILSERVICE BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition Yesterday BJ Services NYSEBJSStrong Buy announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA Inc NASDAQOSCA for per share a premium to the preannouncement stock price This allcash deal equates to a total purchase price of roughly million and is expected to close by the end of the second calendar quarter OSCA provides a full array of completionrelated products and services including completion fluids completion tools and completion services BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental products services and markets across its existing asset and customer base to yield significant pullthrough revenue opportunities down the road While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA the combination makes a lot of strategic sense Following the announced acquisition we are making slight modifications to our nearterm estimates Specifically we are shaving a nickel from our existing FY estimate bringing it down to per share This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition without significant nearterm cost savings or pull through benefits As management indicated on its conference call it expects the deal to be accretive to the FY consensus of per share by to per share Since we are already in print at we are leaving our FY estimates unchanged in order to be conservative Given the expected slight accretion to FY earnings combined with potential longerterm upside and an improving market outlook we are maintaining our Strong Buy rating and month target price of per share Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely undervalued relative to its peers Following yesterdays acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services it is even more clear now that Tetra Technologies NYSETTIStrong Buy is cheap Specifically OSCA was purchased for between x EPS or x EBITDA If we apply those multiples to TTI we come up with a value of to per share as opposed to the current price of per share The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA only perhaps not as well known Following OSCAs acquisition there remains a chance that TTI could be taken out at some point in time although we have no reason to believe it will be soon Furthermore TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of this transaction Finally the company reported fourth quarter EPS of per share a penny above consensus It will host a conference call today at am ET The dial in number is Unit Corp handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations Unit Corp NYSEUNTStrong Buy reported fourth quarter earnings of per share compared to per share in the fourth quarter of This result was ahead of the consensus estimate of per share Revenues for the quarter came in at million down approximately from last year and down from the third quarter Likewise overall operating margins were down over basis points yeartoyear to about while they were also down a like amount on a sequential basis The strong quarterly results were largely a result of strongerthanexpected dayrates utilization and margins during the quarter In fact average dayrates were down by only about to just under per day Meanwhile average realized oil and natural gas prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with declines on a yeartoyear basis of for oil and for gas Production volumes also decreased from last year by for oil and for natural gas Despite the generally strong results drilling activity has fallen dramatically over the past couple months This drop in overall rig activity has had a significant impact on Units utilization dropping from a quarterly average of nearly rigs in Q to the current runrate of pulling dayrates down another currently Due to declines in the nearterm outlook for drilling and production combined with Units current activity indicators dayrates utilization production and commodity prices we are adjusting our quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates Accordingly we are maintaining our estimate of per share and our estimate of per share Despite the lack of nearterm visibility the improving longterm outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy rating with a month target price of per share based on a blended average of three valuation techniques Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss Conrad Industries NASDAQCNRDStrong Buy reported its fourth quarter of a loss of per share compared to a profit of per share in the fourth quarter of This results missed the consensus estimate by per share Revenues for the quarter came in at million which was down from this same quarter last year and down from last quarter The gross margin for the quarter was which was down over basis points from the year ago period and down almost basis points sequentially The backlog at quarterend stood at million down from the fourth quarter of but up from last quarter The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the economy and offshore oil and gas industry The Company will host a conference call at am ET this morning You may access the call by dialing A replay will be available by dialing and using access code EP AEC Beats Q Expectations EnCana Merger On Track AEC NYSEAOGStrong Buy reported fourth quarter EPS of C per share which was ahead of our estimate of C per share AEC achieved record sales averaging Boed up from Each of the three growth platforms Canada the US Rockies and Ecuador set new records In AECs established conventional reserves rose by to nearly Tcf of gas and more than million Bbls of oil and natural gas liquids The Company replaced of conventional sales with of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit The largest reserve additions were in the US Rockies and northeast British Columbia The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholders meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly thereafter Alberta Energys merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in the industry with a C billion enterprise value and visible production growth in excess of annually for at least the next five years The combined company will have a dominant position in North America with interests in western Canada the US Rockies offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico as well as million undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern Colorado to Alaska EnCana will also have large international growth engines in Ecuador and the North Sea Our
