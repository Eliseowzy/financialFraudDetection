Cc Hilliard Marlene Hernandez Elizabeth L Subject RE ENA Upstream issues Stacey I have reviewed all of the meter discrepancies and corrected them Elizabeth Hernandez is doing a great job of catching the deals as they are input and flagging them in Special handling as to which type of confirmationcontract should be used The process is getting better We have asked Nelson Ferries to input the well names in special handling if the deal is a first purchaser deal If he does not we are trying to catch them and get that information from him There is a new September file on the O drive named Upstream Confirms September All but of the deals for September have the meter information needed to send a confirmation I added a column from last month to indicate when the deal is on flex point and can be moved to a different pipe at our discretion We are going to add some language to the confirm for those As for the tax information I do not know what you need from me on that I do not have any tax information Do I need to work with tax to get something Again I want to thank you for working so hard to improve the process If you need anything else please let me know Thanks Judy Original Message From Richardson Stacey Sent Wednesday August PM To Thorne Judy Cc Hilliard Marlene Subject RE ENA Upstream issues Judy I think most of these issues were covered yesterday in the meeting I missed so sorry for that As Ellen has explained it to me we really dont have any tax reporting issues with gas purchased under the Wellhead Pooling Point GTC as we are not first purchaser We would like add these meters to those GTCs to be clean but its not needed IN GLOBAL CONTRACTS for scheduling or tax reporting I am concerned about the discrepancies between what Susan found on the deals and what is on the spreadsheet Ill be happy to go in and update information but Id rather have your OK on each of them I know youre busy but since Ellen is also using this info for the confirmations I dont want to change anything without your approval Please review all the comments in the meter field comments are in all fields with either a meter number name or pipe discrepancy and let me know which ones youd like us to change One last concern until Russ Severson is able to add a flag in Sitara indicating whether ENA Upstream is first purchaser or not the contracts group will not be able to tell which GTC to attach as the deals come across unless there is a comment or special handling Can you please make sure that all deals are input with information to indicate whether the contracts group should attach a Committed Reserves GTC a Wellhead Pooling Point GTC a GTC Firm until Gerald gets the new GTC version in place etc Marlene still needs tax information as she requested before We will still need full meter information for any committed reserves GTC or contract where we are first purchaser Please let me know if you have any questions I appreciate your help Thanks SBR x Original Message From Thorne Judy Sent Tuesday August AM To Richardson Stacey Subject RE ENA Upstream issues Stacey Have these issues been resolved Judy Original Message From Richardson Stacey Sent Monday August PM To Thorne Judy Cc Bryan Linda S Green Joseph M Franklin Mary Theresa Hrna Sandra Subject ENA Upstream issues I just wanted to address a few issues I had mostly concerning severance taxes First of all I have come across some deals missing meter information that were either confirmed under Firm GTCs with tolerance language or Enfolio masters already in place Even if we did not use a Committed Reserves GTC or Committed Reserves Master we still may be liable for payment andor reporting of severance taxes Therefore we still need meter information on those deals Secondly to set up meters in Global Facilities for severance tax reporting Marlene needs certain tax information tax ID number well numbers as assigned by state taxing authority etc that should probably come from the producer Whose responsibility will it be to get that information from the operator Can Marlene let you know what she needs and have you work with the operator We want the information flow to be as smooth as possible and Im worried about having several different people try to work with the operator Lastly Marlene has found some meters listed that are not wellhead meters or producer connects Some of the meters she checked were interconnects pooling points etc which cannot be set up as severance tax points in the Global Facilities system Please work with her so that she has all the information she needs to set up wellhead metersproducer connects as needed Please let me know if you have any questions or need to discuss this information further We also probably need to include Mary Franklin in any discussions regarding taxes since I believe she will be handling the severance tax reporting in Unify Thanks Stacey Barclay Richardson Enron Net Works LLC Global Contracts Office Fax Pager
