meeting The team leader is Tracy Kuehl but Chris Gaston Jeff Grieder Tom Murphy Blackie Foutz who are on the team can all help with this project I will be out of the office until Feb but I can be reached by pager or cell phone My pager has the capability of accepting alpha messages You can send them through Lotus Notes with the address of Do not enter a subject Just type in the message area Please include you name at the end so I will know who its from If you can set up a meeting after Feb preferably Feb or I would appreciate it so I can attend Ron M Jeffery Fawcett PM To Ronald

Subject Ameramex Project Bloomfield Rick Moore with Ameramex called and said their project is moving forward on a fairly expedited basis Theyve recently obtained a City of Farmington pledge of public funds a precursor to a formal bond issue to underpin the financing To refresh your memory this project is another trigeneration project Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide Weve previously provided a route map and estimate mi of pipe K directindirect cost to Ameramex Ameramexs financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx months To this end Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised if necessary estimate of the cost to interconnect There are several other issues to be dealt with here including what is the final deal structure including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations andor engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate designconfiguration of facilities Depending on the outcome of the survey hed like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities Ron since you provided all the prior facility planning support Id like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project Ill also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you and engineering to optimize the designrouting of this interconnectlateral pipeline Ill work with the customer to setup a site meeting when you return to work after To bring you and others up to speed Ive included a couple of the original emails giving a little more detail on the estimate and a map of the route Ronald Matthews PM To Jeffery FawcettET NRON cc Terry GalassiniET NRON Rich JollyET NRON David RoenschET NRON Team SanJuanET NRON Subject Amerimex Energy Farms Project Jeff I talked with the San Juan team and came up with a pipeline route to the proposed Energy Farms site located in S SE Sec TN RW and the NE NE Sec TN RW all in San Juan County NM Per the correspondence Energy Farms is looking at a delivery around MMcfd The best approach to serving this load would be to take gas from the suction side of Bloomfield CS The pipeline would start there a travel about miles to the northwest section of the proposed site see attached map A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TWs property along with the other meter facilities Below is a breakdown of the facility cost Estimated costs are and would have to be refined miles of pipeline side valve orifice meter run w gallagher flow conditioner flow control There is a possibility that the meter facility costs could be lower by using an existing metering header system but a more detailed review would be required Please feel free to call if you have any questions I will send you a copy of the estimated costs for both the pipeline and measurement since they cant be attached Jeffery Fawcett AM To Steven HarrisET NRON Kevin HyattET nron Susan ScottET NRON Lorraine LindbergET NRON TK LohmanET NRON Christine StokesET NRON cc Ronald MatthewsET NRON Terry GalassiniET NRON Subject Amerimex Bloomfield Project Attached see a note I sent to Rick Moore Rick works for a company called Amerimex Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG the early years Amerimex is a developer of trigeneration projects In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield another one is being considered for Santa Theresa NM If you recall we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the byproducts of electric generation Cogeneration refers to the process where waste heatsteam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially usually to manufacturing facilities for plant purposes Trigeneration on the other hand refers the process where not only is the waste heatsteam utilized but also the carbon dioxide Therefore trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield NM area The facility to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies would have a nominal rating of MW resulting in a gas burn of about MMcfd The plant would require gas deliveries at approx psig The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates kv transmission line that is proximate to the site Given the politically correct nature of these facilities the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a MM bond As you can see were in the very earliest stages of conversation Well keep the group posted on progress Forwarded by Jeffery FawcettETSEnron on AM Jeffery Fawcett AM To cc Ronald MatthewsET NRON Subject Amerimex Bloomfield Project Rick It was really great visiting with you the other day It never ceases to amaze me how small a world this is I hope this project moves forward and we get the opportunity to work together again Attached for your use is the schematic you spoke with Ron Matthews about Its not too terribly detailed so I dont know if it will be useful or not We have much more detailed images of the Bloomfield area on our alignments but without a legal description were a little blind I dont know if youve had a chance to get the legal description for the proposed plant site yet or not but if you have it would you forward that on to me We could then get started at not only putting together a rough cost estimate for the tap and meter but we could begin looking for the best route for a lateral line between the facilities Look forward to hearing from you soon

interconnect where the Texas Co Lateral OKG connected to the OKM An incorrect line number on the project authorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site Engineering Records did not have the one page amendment with the project authorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities Texas Co facilities had been removed The remaining pipe downstream of the compress or site to OKM approximately miles has been transferred to EOG Resources as of June Project Authorization CRemoval Ogden HS Monitor SN Verification of materials used in the construction of the monitor was needed Operations confirmed that a Farm Tap Assembly was used to create t he monitoring facilities not to install a farm tap within the Ogden Plant yar d Cedar Falls Marketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order to purchase a new regulator since the interruptible peaking turbine load is causing problems with the existing regulator Property Accounting reported the amount remaining but it will not be enough for a new regulator St Croix Valley Provided options for the proposed ten year expansion for St Croix Valley Examined cost versus incremental growth on the Black River Falls Branchline Provided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the Wisconsi n Gas proposal Following the latest strategic marketing meeting will exami ne compression alternatives for St Criox Valley as a standalone project Grimes TBS Pressure Increase Working with Marketing and the Field Examined several options regarding t he customers request for a pressure increase to a delivery of psig Marketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategic fit for the customer Ogden Building Discharge Pressure Research has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports the psig MAOP for the building discharge header The supporting documentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval If documentation is approved as supporting evidence for the psig MAOP the n only minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increase the discharge pressure of the building engines Pengilly TBS Mesabi System Marketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requir ed to increase firm at Pengilly from mcfday to mcfday The first estimate for consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne l only installing the EFM The team responded with a proposal that they woul d be willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during JanMarch A second estimate of was submitted to Marketing which included all district labor This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior t o Dec If a deal is made after Dec then the higher cost estimate applies Monroe TBS Mods Pressure Increase The Monroe TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering The project w as the result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately mcfday The y also requested a pressure increase at the station from psig to psig A Form Pressure Increase Request Form is being circulated f or signature The project has a targeted Nov inservice date The modifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP Milbank Project Continued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today Melbourne Project Release The Melbourne TBS Mods project was released to Engineering The projec t consists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from mcfday to mcfday at Melbourne Presently the Marshalltown BL is constrained and cou ld not support the incremental firm Alliant will realign gas away from the Marshalltown TBS which is at the end of this BL to the Marshalltown A TBS which is on a different BL This will open up capacity on the line fo r this new load The project has a targeted Nov inservice date Modifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and replacing the meter Adel A TBS Mods project release The Adel A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering This project wa s a result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel A to a Firm load The new Firm load will be mcfday The project has a targeted Nov inservice date The station will have a new meter installed along with piping size modifications Ethanol Injection Reviewed and researched for Marketing the possibility of injecting Ethano l into the pipeline for a possible Green Energy rating and as a means of BT U enhancement Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline conditions even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not insure the Ethanol from liquefying dropping out and collecting into the pipeline low spots Also there were many issues concerning possible liqui ds entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers equipmen t Planning recommended that this project not be pursued Researched for Marketing was the possibility of burning a MethaneEthanol mix in our equipment ie Turbines in order to receive a Green Power rating Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of coburning ethanol and methane As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to work with us however they only recommended it if it were to be a constant fuel source Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system retrofits required Also if this were not a constant fuel then there woul d have to be two separate fuel systems coburn and methane only and a complete fuel control system change With all that the project has been deemed cost prohibitive Vapor Injection of Propane VIP Service Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during peak days Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni ng team concerning specific requirements of the new service ie of daysy r firm daily firm etc Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any more action is taken Electric Generation Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to review the possibility of utilizing standby generators as electric produce rs for the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months A few discrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release d to complete the engineering study Beaver Dehy A request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t he Capacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the SE line Beaver is considering a capital project to reroute the dehy system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the discharge thus increasing the capacity Cogentrix Power Plant Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were prepared and forwarded to Marketing The details of the cost estimate included a breakdown of costs for Material Costs Labor Freight and Taxes SurveysPermits Construction Support District Labor EngineeringDraftingAsbuilts Contingency Overhead AFUDC The break down of costs was done for the Sheldon Lehigh and Raun projects in Nebraska and Iowa Cherokee Ethanol Projects Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County Iowa The delivery volume was for MMCFD at a delivery pressure of psig It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for MMCFD for two years and then increase to the MMCFD level The cost estimate assumed that the initial design would be for the MMCFD This w as done to reduce the cost for the project Each cost estimate was done for a firm transport level and an interruptible transport level cost estimate s total Two of the sites are on the C line approximately miles southwes t of the Paullina Station The remaining sites were on the Storm LakeLytton Branchline
