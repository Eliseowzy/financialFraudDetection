officer killed New York Times Co en ters bidding for Red Sox Intel takes tech spotlight IMAGE Dynegy abandons Enron deal Shares of energy trader plunge bankru ptcy looms By Lisa Sanders CBSMarketWatchcom Newswatch More Headl ines HOUSTON CBSMW Dynegy Corp on Wednesday abandoned its pla n to rescue Enron Corp after Enrons credit ratings were cut to junkbond status raising the prospects of a bankruptcy filing for what was once the largest US energy trader Enron shares ENE closed at cents down having lost as much as percent of their value on the day and havin g collapsed from a week high of almost just months ago The compa ny lost around billion worth of market capitalization from Tuesday to Wednesday Close to million Enron shares had changed hands Wednesday b y the close and the stock broke the alltime volume record of million shares set by Intel on Sept Dynegy DYN shares lost or percent to Saying in a conference call that it had to protect its shareholders Dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with E nron citing Enrons breaches of representations warranties covenants an d agreements in the merger agreement including the material adverse change provision Companyspecific problems Dynegy Chairman and Chief Execut ive Chuck Watson said some of the best deals are the ones that dont get done While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in diffi culties this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business he said Dynegy President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Bergstrom sai d that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for Enrons diminished role in the business and that the industry has suffered no degradation as he put it There has been a clear flight to quality and its occurring as we speak Bergstrom said Dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform D ynegydirect is a platform much like Enrons flagship EnronOnline which it turned off Wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online ener gytrading platform accounting for an average of billion in trades a da y Dynegys trading exposure to Enron is million and the company is n o longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow Housto n industrial giant Bergstrom said Dynegys customerbased assetbacked energy delivery network has been the driver of our percent compounded a nnual growth rate for the past years and will continue to provide us wit h earnings sustainability and future growth Watson said As part of the deal Dynegy had the option to keep Northern Natural Gas Enrons highly va lued naturalgas pipeline even if the agreement were terminated The compa ny said during the call that it would exercise that option ChevronTexaco CVX which owns a percent stake in Dynegy originally gave bill ion to the company in the transaction Dynegy used the money to purchase percent of the preferred shares of Northern Natural Gas Enron has d ays from the date the merger agreement was signed Nov to repurchase th e pipeline system Watson said Enron said in a statement that it was revie wing Dynegys claim of rights to Northern Enron representatives did not p articipate in the call and Dynegy executives said they had been advised ag ainst the customary practice of taking questions Enron said it has tempor arily suspended payments other than those necessary to maintain its core energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those oper ations alive To do this we will work to retain the employees necessary t o the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses said Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay Enron told employees their questio ns would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks o n Friday Analysts said the next step for Enron would likely be a bankrupt cy filing Chapter is not the worst of all worlds by any means said John Olson a Houstonbased energy analyst The key to salvaging the busin ess is the level of debtorinpossession financing they can get to allow th em to trade in some realistic fashion DIP financing takes precedence ove r all other claims he said The equity people are now at the very bottom of the barrel and the only people lower than them are the people who fil ed the stockholder suits Olson said In a note to clients analyst Mich ael Heim of AG Edwards said that Enron without Dynegy has no value Enron will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly Heim said Unli ke other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price t here are no hard assets to salvage Ahead of this news SP cut Enrons r ating to Bminus or junk status from BBBminus which is the lowest inves tmentgrade rating The rating agency said that the move reflects concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with Dynegy and liquidity impl ications of the possible failure of that transaction The ratings are place d on CreditWatch with developing implications Moodys made its announcem ent of a rating cut to B from Baa and said that Enrons debt remains unde r review for additional downgrade In its report Moodys cited the likeli hood of a DynegyEnron breakup fueled by Enrons declining financial perfo rmance as the reason for the downgrade Moodys Baa rating was pred icated on good prospects for completion of the merger with Dynegy and reaso nable prospects for marginally investmentgrade characteristics of the merg ed entity Moodys wrote Furthermore lack of confidence in Enron by its trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting Enrons core trad ing operations For Enron to survive the credit agency said its impera tive that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable Fitc h which had rated Enron BBBminus lowered the rating to CC which indica tes that default of some kind appears probable The US Treasury is keep ing an eye on the impact the Enron fallout is having on the credit markets spokeswoman Michele Davis said Wednesday We are monitoring credit mark ets as we do every day Davis said Markets always fluctuate and we haven t seen anything extraordinary Treasury said that outside its surveillanc e of credit markets it would refer any inquiries on energy trading to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commi ssion Earlier in the day IMAGE Dynegy which had originally offere d to buy Enron for billion in stock confirmed Tuesday that the two comp anies were discussing a new deal structure and it said ahead of the credit ratings and eventual termination news Wednesday that discussions were cont inuing Im not aware of any changes in any status of the merger Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said before the SP announcement The merger agreemen t contained a material adverseaffect clause that if triggered allowed Dy negy to walk away from the deal The decline in Enrons stock price and in formation contained in the companys Q filing of Nov could had activ ated the clause but Olson said the SP downgrade clearly fit the descripti on of a material adverse affect Also Wednesday UBS Warburg and RBC Capi tal cut their ratings on Enron to hold from strong buy and from stron g buy to buyspeculative respectively Lisa Sanders is a Dallasbased reporter for CBSMarketWatchcom IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGEIntraday data provided by SP Comstock and su bject to terms of
