I will be praying for you I was just praying and asking God what I could say to you I dont want to be presumptuous This is the verse that came to mind Psalm Many are the afflictions of the righteous but the LORD delivereth him out of them all You may not feel righteous right now but you are When you gave Jesus your life you became righteous So you will be deliveredit may not look like it now but this is not the end of the story He has a plan I know that you cant see HOW this could work together for good for you but it will Great is His faithfulness All afflictionsit says ALL Original Message From To Sent PM Subject RE Precious man of God Lynda I really appreciate your email I have relied heavily on my faith The Bible and prayer to get through the last few weeks Without Gods help I would have surely crumbled May He continue to bless you Ken Original Message From Phinney Lynda L LyndaL illiamscomENRON Sent Thursday November AM To Lay Kenneth Subject Precious man of God Mr Lay I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years God has been faithful and seen me through them all Dear sir I can tell you that I can count it all joy I just want to encourage you These look like very dark times right now Call upon the name of the Lord Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done He is a BIG GOOD God that LOVES you His arm hasnt been shortened that He cannot help you You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report You will glorify God in this I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear It would bring you such comfort It is based on the verse that talks about all of my help cometh from the Lord How true that is for you Lord Jesus you are a good God that sees all things Mr Lay is a man of God That means he is your child You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble These troubles are over his head but under your feet Lord Jesus show yourself strong on his behalf Glorify yourself and Mr Lay will give you the glory He knows Lord Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head Hear him from where you are We are all but dust Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end Jer For I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the LORD thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end Who can stand except you give us grace Lord you are so good Remind Mr Lay of who you really are In the mighty name of Jesus Mr Lay get some scripture to hang ontowrite it down on a card and carry it with you When things come against you the enemy you will need to remember who you are in Jesus The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God Satan against Jesus in the wilderness Isaiah No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD and their righteousness is of me saith the LORD Oh Mr Lay one more thing I am telling you that I havent a clue as to what has or has not been done I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is If you will read Isaiahs calling in Isaiah and read Moses calling in Exodus you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses remember he had killed an Egyptian was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong God tells us that He hasnt dealt with us according to our sins KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf It is ALWAYS about Gods SPIRIT and not our strength When I started this email you were just a stranger You are now my beloved brother in Christ Isnt it amazing how God works He has knit my heart to yours I will be on my knees for you Phillipians tells us to pray for EVERYTHING What does everything mean
