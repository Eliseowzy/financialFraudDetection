this configuration It may be done in stages eg close the valve north of Mesa first then north of Tate then finally north of Finney There is some concern about moving liquids around when the flow is reversed Also April is the target date but there is nothing magic about it if we need to slip back Finney is one of the related issues to be resolved As you know people have been working on a posting reminding everyone of our BTUSCF tariff requirement My understanding is Marketing would contact the Finney shippers after the posting giving them a month to find someplace else for Finney I foresee during the test period that Finney would be subject to shut in With no Tekas CIG would have to be about MMD to make BTU east of Finney If CIG is too low we would have to shut in Finney A variation on this is to lower the minimum operational BTU value to BTUSCF for the Burdett line This would lower the required CIG volume to about MMD It has been determined that BTU gas would be workable for the Burdett loads that in the past have operated at BTU for extended time periods Physically the gas would burn But a formal decision to operate at BTU has not been made If anyone has any differentmore

MullinvilleOperations Team HolcombFldComp Team Tate Team mailto mailto Howard Randy Miller Dave Reed Ray Pribble Dan January Steve Spraggins Gary Graves Jerry Gaines David Hallowell Dean Peschka Mike BushtonMaintenance Team BushtonOperations Team Macksville Team Subject Proposed Holcomb South Flow Test LD As we discussed at our meeting below is the proposed configuration for the April test flowing volumes south from Holcomb BACKGROUND A background for those not at the meeting NNG Marketing is in discussions with Oneok about rerouting Rich stream gas in order to restart the Bushton Helium plant The proposal being pursued is to leave the higher CO CIG gas in the Burdett line and shift more of the remaining gas flow from the Burdett line to the SubletteMullinville line The Burdett line would then be routed to the Lean inlet at Bushton and Oneok would receive only the Mullinville volumes into the Rich inlet The Helium plant would operate on a reduced total volume but would avoid receiving any higher CO gas Oneok has stated that about MMD of flow from Mullinville would allow them to operate their Helium plant To accomodate this the block valve north of Finney would be closed routing all the Finney and Tate and Mesa volumes south to Hugoton At Hugoton this gas would be routed to the Oklahoma suction and compressed to Sublette To accomplish this modifications would be made at the Sunflower meterregulator station to allow operation at a lower inlet pressure Piping would be added to the Hugoton yard to route the Holcomb gas to the OK suction However a temporary rerouting of gas using existing Hugoton yard piping was found This can only be done on a short term basis duing cool weather as it involves taking three dehy contactors out of service So the plan is to reroute this gas beginning April and continue through the rest of the month This would also be communicated to Oneok giving them an opportunity to test run their Helium plant on the lower volume if they chose to If all related issues are resolved and an agreement is signed with Oneok the piping modifications would be made in May PIPELINE CONFIGURATION The schematics below utilize actual volumes from in a model tuned to actual conditions The model utilizes volumes but has the block north of Finney closed and the gas routed to the Hugoton Oklahoma suction Note the horsepower values in this schematic are not accurate Note that with these actual volumes and April ambient and ground temperatures Fowler and Macksville do not run Finney and discharge around PSIG Tate is predicted at PSIG BTUs from Finney to Tate are at the Finney value of about BTU but are at BTU at Tate Note also that BTUs on the Burdett line are good with BTU east of Finney The Burdett line BTUs are of course contingent on adequate CIG volumes COMPRESSION CONFIGURATION Below are the results of detailed compression calculations that I did I used actual suction temperatures most places and a couple of model predicted suction temperatures where I did not have actuals There is some uncertainty about the Hugoton Kansas compression as I may not have accounted for possible recirculation flow routing correctly I still expect it to be workable though TEST DATA COLLECTION We have compressor unit information available most places via SCADA For Finney and Tate it would be helpful if the teams could send average daily values for the units on suction and discharge pressure RPM and step They can be sent to me via email or FAX If operations are smooth after the first week or so we could discontinue the data collection These are engineering numbers and it is not an exact science But looking it all over I believe there is adequate margin for error and that this is a workable configuration If anyone sees real problems with it please let me know FYI Am working on a plan for pressure sweeping the Hugoton to Holcomb line tentatively planned for this Wednesday Thanks John
