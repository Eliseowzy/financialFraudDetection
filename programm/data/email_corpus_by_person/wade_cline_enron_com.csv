have not been doing their job and I am calling them on the carpet I think the legal team has been doing exactly what has been expected from them but maybe some of our newer business people havent understood the need for India legal to communicate freely and often directly to Houston legal Ill take care of that But after my recent visit to Houston and discussions there with you and others I just want information to flow freely and often between India and Houston So Im trying to make sure that happens by encouraging info flow below If you ever feel you need more please let me know Ill also let you decide how you want info to flow from the India legal team up to Houston You may wish to have them deal directly with just one of you or all Your call and you can communicate this to the India legal team as to how you want communication to occur Wade Forwarded by Wade ClineENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM enron india From Wade Cline PM To Paul KraskeENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Neil McGregorENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Sandeep KatwalaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Re FA Issues Paul Im all in favor of going after GE but part of that is probably emotions But we will also never meet a tougher litigation opponent so we better be prepared and have thought through all the ramifications Im sure you are doing this but make sure you keep Rob Mark and Bruce in the loop and any other people they might want you to keep involved In that regard after several meetings in Houston on general DPC matters please ensure that you keep Rob Mark and Bruce up to speed on all DPC legal matters We need to make sure the information flow is transparent and seamless not only up the business side but also the legal side This will only become more important as we go into our challenges Thanks Wade Neil McGregor PM To Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT James A HughesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc James L CT Subject Re Re FA Issues For your info we have contacted Medway a plant in the UK which has had similar compressor blade failures on the FAs This problem seems to be a type fault and along that line we have sounded out the Insurers and Medway whether they would be interested in taking a joint action against GE on the basis that the GTs GE has supplied are not fit for purpose The response was a resounding yes with the insurers wanting to set up a meeting between the affected parties This was done on a confidential basis and I have not pulled the trigger on setting this up Jim Boullion the insurance contact was David Way Our legal advice is that it would be very difficult to take this kind of action given the extent of the no consequentials language in the contract under NY law However this point may be a reasonable Hammer over GE if they cut up rough and give us a bad deal I think a joint action in the market could severely affect GEs sales position of the FA product range whether we have a strong case or not Gordon Grimes and the litigation team are tasked with trying to find us an angle on which to sue Further points to take note of below are Medway got stiffed by GE with the cost of repairs and extended warranty whereas we got these covered in our last deal The insurance market dried up in the UK on the insurability of these rotors Final insurance costs rose and their deductable went over days Ours is currently days We negotiated it down from days last year on our insurance renewal programme Insurabiltiy of the GTs including phase is going to be a challenge and MSEB is going to resist paying any increase in premium Insurance cost is a pass through to MSEB We need to be cognisant of these facts when dealing with GE next week Neil Forwarded by Neil McGregorENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM V S NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Neil McGregorENRON NRON CT cc Ken BladesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Re FA Issues Medway has experienced two compressor failures the first one on CT in November when an R tip broke off and resulted in a major compressor failure The rotor was replaced with their spare one The second failure was more recent in July on CT when five of the R blade tips broke off and caused secondary damages to rows R and R In this case though GE advocated site repair of the rotor the insurance company refused to accept it Medway had to send the rotor for refurbishment to the GE repair facility before they could get reinsure this turbine The costs of repair were borne by Medway and all warranties had run out Both gas turbines had the old design of compressor blades Subsequent to the failure robust compressor blades were installed in row and on both compressors CT is running with the new compressor blades since December A September CI and boroscope inspection on this unit revealed minor burring of R stage blades CT is running with robust blades since October Though Tim Sharp was a bit circumspect on commercial questions he did indicate that their insurance deductibles had gone over days with a premium increase of about and the

trailing edge missing We also noticed small metal particles in the stage extraction strainer An analysis of this indicated that blade material We opened up the machine and have mapped upward of blades that are damaged We are working with GE on arriving at a repairreplacement decision This is the third incident at Dabhol and we are really concerned that even a robust rotor GE now says that we have

recent letter to the In dian Prime Minister You recall that we recommended you write again to the Prime Minister and express disappointment at the lack of progress since you r July trip and your August letter containing our offer to sell our equity at costs I believe writing this letter was the proper response but only ti me will tell what reaction if any finally comes from the Indian governmen t I think you should know about the press coverage of the letter just in cas e the letter were to come up in any conversation you might have with someon e from the US government I am not anticipating this at all but I would no t want you to be unprepared about the press coverage The US embassy over h ere is very much up to speed I met again with Ambassador Blackwill on Tue sday of this week and gave him a general update on the current status His view is that it is very difficult in the postSept environment to get a nyone in Delhi or Washington to pay attention to economic matters such as D abhol but he is trying as best he can He is meeting with Brajesh Mishra Prime Ministers principal secretary on Saturday who will have just retur ned from Washington meetings with Ms Rice among others principally to di scuss antiterrorist matters John Hardy of our DC office briefed the State Department last week in advance of these meetings and we are awaiting to hear any discussion or outcome regarding Dabhol Regarding press coverage of the letter as we anticipated the entire lette r was leaked to the press Several articles have appeared that describe the harshly worded letter and many articles have quoted verbatim sections fr om the letter The Wall Street Journal article from last week presented the letter fairly and I think it came out rather sympathetic to our position The Indian papers have been neutral to negative For example an editorial reprinted below was in Wednesdays Financial Express a business daily i n India but not as widely circulated or respected as The Economic Times or The Business Standard Note the editorial below says your letter states that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms aut omatically faces sanctions from that country Your letter did not state th at but this is a holdover from the earlier Financial Times interview Many people I have met with in the Indian government have made references t o the letter saying they do not think it was appropriate I respond by say ing that given our year history of nothing but frustrations and the lack of progress over the past months we do think it is appropriate and it r eflects our current views regarding our experience in India Generally whe n they mention it time and again it probably means the letter is having at least some of its intended effect Ill keep you Stan and Jim updated as we hear more from the Indian governm ent Wade Nikita Varma PM ToNikita VarmaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc bcc Wade ClineENRONDEVELOPMENT SubjectFrom The Enron India Newsdesk September th Newsclips THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Wednesday September Lay off Mr Lay Editorial Enron tries terror tactics Enron Corporations CEO Kenneth Lay has reportedly written a letter to Prim e Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee warning him of adverse consequences to the Indian economy if the Dabhol Power Company imbroglio is not resolved quickl y He says that if Enron receives anything less than its full investment in DPC it would amount to an act of expropriation He further points out tha t any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automa tically faces sanctions from that country Reportedly the letter was writt en three days after the attack on the World Trade Centre So Mr Lay probabl y ought to be forgiven for reading more than he should into the dead or al ive rhetoric of his pal George W Bush whose election campaign Mr Lay gen erously funded Saner counsel has since prevailed even at the White House and far from imposing fresh sanctions the US government is busy buying sup port even from countries such as Pakistan by lifting sanctions and offering a hefty aid package Enron has never hesitated to use the considerable eco nomic and political clout of the US government in pushing the Dabhol projec t at various times Post September the US government which is in fact rewarding Pakistan despite its clearly identified role in funding terror ist groups ought not to be terrorising India on Enron Hence it is entir ely appropriate for the Prime Minister to borrow that little Americanism r ecently made popular by Pervez Musharraf and ask Kenneth Lay to lay off Interestingly Mr Lays letter apparently makes no mention of several impor tant facts that will dictate how much India may have to pay Enron These in clude the findings of the Madhav Godbole committee report which expose subs tantial overcharging by DPC on several counts and reveals excess capacity c reated for port handling and regassification Moreover DPCs inability to ramp up the power plant to full contracted capacity within the specified ti me period has enormous penal provisions attached to it This serious techni cal deficiency apart which alone is grounds enough for repudiating the DP C contract the government also has a good case to charge the US company w ith fraud and misrepresentation The Maharashtra government s judicial inq uiry only makes Indias case stronger Let us not allow ourselves to be pus hed around by Enrons threats and political connections
