Directors Short enough to read over a cup of caffe latte the Board Cafe offers a menu of ideas opinion news and resources to help board members give and get the most out of board service Co published by CompassPoint Nonprofit Services and BoardSource formerly National Center for Nonprofit Boards Chef Writer Jan Masaoka NovemberDecember Vol No Readyto print version at Once I was on a board and was so unhappy with the new executive director that I decided to resign from the board I called the Board President to tell her I was leaving and to my complete surprise she said that nearly the whole board felt the same way Since there had never been any disagreements or sharp words at any of the board meetings I had assumed that everyone ELSE on the board was happy with the executive director The Board President had telephoned a few of the board members who had left before their terms were up and she had been surprised to hear their dissatisfaction with the executive director That prompted her to call other board members who had the same sense A few months later the executive director was fired and she subsequently sued the organization for wrongful termination the suit was settled at a low amount This story links two of the topics for this months Board Cafe exit interviews for board members and What Every Board Needs to Do About Insurance Also an item on a terrific new book and heres a

interviews with departing employees and tabulate the reasons for the departures If there seem to be silent andor disgruntled board members leaving the board a series of short telephone exit interviews might reveal important reasons why Ask a former board chair consultant or another neutral person to do the interviews In many cases departing board members reveal that they have left due to disagreements with the executive director or the board chair or are disturbed about the overall direction of the organization PRACTICAL WAYS TO REACH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES Does your organization

INSURANCE By Melanie Herman Nonprofit Risk Management Center Not every nonprofit needs every type of insurance But every nonprofit board should consider its insurance needs and the resources needed to protect the good health and mission of the organization We offer tips on insurance issues to get you started Examine exposures first Rather than start with looking at the current insurance policies begin by looking at how your nonprofit is exposed to possible lawsuits and losses While lawsuits against nonprofits are relatively uncommon the most common types of suits against nonprofit boards are ones that allege wrongful employment practices such as wrongful termination sexual harassment or retaliation Which of your activities are more likely to lead to lawsuits damage to reputation finances or property Make sure your organization is working with an expert it can trust An insurance agent broker or consultant can provide valuable advice and practical help on coverage for your nonprofit Seek someone experienced with nonprofits and familiar with the work you do or committed to learning about it Your advisor should live up to the promises he or she makes give prompt and credible answers to your questions take the time to understand your organization and seem genuinely interested in helping you To avoid awkward situations and to prevent a potentially dangerous conflict of interest choose someone unaffiliated with your nonprofit Have an annual report to the board on insurance and risk If you dont have a board Insurance or Risk Management Committee be sure that insurance review is assigned to another committee such as the Finance Committee or to an individual board member Though insurance policy language can be hard to swallow and even harder to understand its important that someone from the staff or board read the policy from beginning to end including the policy exclusions endorsements and definitions Read the laws Ask the Risk Management or Finance Committee to look at the language in your state volunteer protection laws as well as the federal Volunteer Protection Acts Remember that none of these laws provides absolute protection against suits alleging wrongdoing on the part of nonprofit board members For more information about the federal Volunteer Protection Act see docsprotectioncfm State laws differ and some states do a better job than others of informing the public find the link to your states laws at docssstateshtml Reduce risk as well as buy insurance Just as car insurance isnt a reason to drive recklessly nonprofit insurance is only one element in risk management The board should consider conducting a risk management audit or simply identifying ways to reduce risk There may be simple ways to increase building safety to improve personnel policies strengthen compliance with personnel policies improve performance evaluations or to screen staff and volunteers more thoroughly Talk over the various types of insurance and do what you can when you can No single insurance policy covers all exposures and some are more important than others depending on an organizations circumstances For some a property policy covering buildings and personal property against accidental loss is most important In another organization a policy providing protection for volunteer injuries may be of first import If you cant afford all of the coverages youd like your nonprofit to have start with the policy you consider most important and add others when you can Consider Directors Officers DO liability insurance While many suits against nonprofits are brought against the nonprofit corporation as well as individual managers and board members in a few cases suits are brought solely against board members themselves Many small nonprofits dont buy DO insurance simply because they cant afford it In other cases the board may decide that the risk of a lawsuit is too unlikely or that there may be other ways to finance defending the board and the organization Whether or not you have DO insurance there are board practices that reduce the likelihood of a suit such as preventing conflicts of interest recording no votes in the minutes and ensuring that the organizations employment policies are consistently applied For more about DO insurance see and click on Insurance in the FAQ section Test the market Every three to five years consider shopping your insurance program Invite several brokers or agents to submit proposals or ask the broker to obtain bids from several insurance carriers Doing so will give the board a basis for comparison and a sense about whether youre paying a fair price At the end of experts are predicting that insurance will become more difficult to buy premiums will become more expensive and new exclusions and restrictions are likely to appear This might be a good time to consider changing to a different carrier or to review your overall insurance program Related Board Cafe article Sample
