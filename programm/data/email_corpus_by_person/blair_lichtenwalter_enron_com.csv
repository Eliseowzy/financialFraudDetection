Subject ENEMARKET FOCUSED ON LIQUIDITY CRUNCH AND UNKNOWN Dain Rauscher Wessels a division of Dain Rauscher Incorporated Market overly concerned on cash flow liquidity and assuming the most dire assumptions in our opinion Concerns regarding ENE shares have also impacted the entire diversified energy group We have developed a net asset valuation assuming further writedownsequity adjustments and come up with a valuation of per share For investors with a to month time horizon ENE shares represent a bargain in our opinion We advise investors purchase the shares at current levels Enron Corporation NYSEENE Rating Strong Buy Risk Aggressive Price Target Price Fiscal Yr Prev EPS PE Wk Range DecE x Tr ROE DecE x Yr EPS Gr DecE x Shares Out million Q Book Value Market Cap billion Cash Flow Prev CFPS PCF E x E x E x DIVERSIFIED ENERGYMLPS Mark Easterbrook CFA Neal Dingmann ENESBAggrMARKET FOCUSED ON LIQUIDITY CRUNCH AND UNKNOWN Cash Flow Liquidity Crisis We believe this market is assuming the most grim valuation for these offbalance sheet partnerships and other investments that they have no residual value In addition Enron cannot issue debt to fund the shortterm cash flow need as the company needs its investment grade debt rating for its Wholesale segment Management has discussed various asset sales that should benefit the cash flow situation million in the Q and Portland General in late but the market is unwilling to believe these asset sales will be timely Shareholders have paniced as million shares were traded yesterday but we believe even with dire assumptions the stock can rebound from current levels once the liquidity situation clears up Diversified Energy Group Drawn In The market now is taking it out on other diversified energy stocks as they declined significantly yesterday We believe investors are worried about two factors that may impact the group if these companies extensively using the offbalance sheet structure and if the natural gaspower merchant business will be negatively impacted by the wounded Enron which is the largest merchant player in North America If this continues to impact the group there could be an excellent buying opportunity at some point LongTerm Valuation We have included a net asset valuation on Enron making several dire assumptions ol Enron will be impacted to the full extent of the offbalance sheet partnershipsour assumption is billion The company writes down their investment in broadband our estimate million and their entire net investment in the Dabhol Power Plant in India our estimate million Valuing the three major business with the corresponding EBIT multiple Pipelinex Wholesalex and Retail Energy Servicesx We derive the EBIT multiple on Wholesale and Retail using Dynegys NYSE DYN SB Avg current EBIT multiple on our expected EBIT which includes the share drop from yesterday Although these EBIT multiple seem to consistent with the current market trends they are well below historical norms for the group olWe have looked at the asset valuation in two ways First we have assumed no asset sales and used equity funding as a plug figure which dilutes shares outstanding by Our worst case scenario without asset sales comes up with a net asset valuation of per share including additional shares issued at per share Our second valuation assumes asset sales of billion assumed debt reduction of billion from the Portland General sale and no equity financing With those assumptions we derived a valuation of per share Of course our net asset valuation is based on a longterm view and does not take into consideration the shortterm liquidity crunch ongoing at the company In addition we are making a fairly bold assumption in that all these partnerships and investments no longer have any residual value Debt Rating Most Important Enron management will have to fend off any debt rating downgrades below investment grade so debt cannot make up the cash flow shortfall The company in our opinion will use assets sale and if necessary equity funding to match up cash flows in the short term Unfortunately the timing of assets sales can be lumpy so equity funding is not out of the question Panic Mode Abound With the rapid decline of the shares on large volume we believe investors are panicking and the shares are oversold at x our earnings expectations Although the upcoming Q and Q probably will not paint a good picture we believe the company is in better shape than a pershare stock price suggests With further disclosures on operating segments and on the offbalance sheet partnerships we believe during the next few quarters we could see ENE come back into our valuation Stock Opinion We believe that investors with a time frame of months should now look at Enron shares due to our assessment of the companys attractive valuation There are obviously major concerns regarding Enrons cash flow liquidity in the coming quarters but we believe management should be able to time the sale of assets and equity financing if necessary to bring the balance sheet back into order Most importantly the company must keep its investment grade rating to keep its Wholesale operations running smoothly We believe the core businesses should allow earnings growth of annually threeyear projection We are not suggesting that Enron is out of the woods yet as investors should pay attention to several shortterm events First the filing of the thirdquarter Q should enlighten the Street on the equity reduction and the cash position of the company We also look for the SEC to come down hard on these partnerships We anticipate further disclosures on these partnership going forward In addition we anticipate that the company may still have another writedown andor further reductions of equity in the coming quarters Our net asset valuation notwithstanding we keeping our price target using a discounted cash flow DCF analysis of the wholesale energy segments and EES segment In the moreestablished energy segments we used a multiple valuation of x EBIT We have changed our risk rating on Enron Corporation from Average to Aggressive to reflect our assessment of risks associated with the issues discussed in this note We rate ENE shares Strong BuyAggressive Company Description Enron Corporation is the leading integrated natural gas and power company The company is

Agnes Chan Jerry Ellis Charlie Hagedorn Tad Mulder Alan Parker Alan Austin T Lad Kris tin Webb Adele T Dillon Tom Dillon the links David Link Brother Ja ne BrustGlaeser Cc Subject Quote for the day If nothing else John Walker has usefully nailed one of the selfserving m yths peddled after the awesome intelligence failure of September th Awfu lly sorry we failed to see it coming said the highranking suits but its impossible to do any covert deepcover stuff out in Afghanistan these fel lows are all cousins and brothersinlaw a guy from Jersey would stick o ut like a lapdancer in a burqa As we now know instead of being full of f earsome Pashtun warriors renowned down the centuries the OmarOsama ranks were like a novelty Gap ad Losers of Many Nations misfit Saudis and P akis Brits and Californians Anyone can walk in off the street and be assi stant supervisor of the thirdfloor latrine in Tora Bora by nightfall The only distinguishing feature about John Walker is that hes such an obvious compendium of clappedout clichs from Americas Left Coast the wonder is t he mullahs didnt automatically take him for a CIA plant But no Mr Walker is for real born John Lindh in and from that ba stion of wellheeled dopehead progressivism Californias affluent Marin C ounty Following the traditional Marin pattern his parents divorced his m other converted to Buddhism and the children were taught Native American sp irituality John was sent to an alternative high school In the Bay Area all the high schools are alternative The problem for parents is trying to find any alternative to the alternative The set texts included The Au tobiography Of Malcolm X and John liked it so much that like the late Mr X he too decided to embrace Islam and change his name to Sulayman His par ents putting their foot down for what seems to be the first and last time demanded the right to continue calling him John They had after all gone to the trouble of naming him after one of the colossi of the age John Len non To this he consented In return they let him study at the Mill Valley Islamic Center In after an awkward trip to their ancestral Ireland in which John tru dged dutifully round the auld sod wearing his turban and white robes Frank Lindh agreed to let his year old son spend a year in Yemen on the next stage of his spiritual odyssey He was just another middleclass kid who d gone off to find himself but like most of the others he always knew h ow to find daddy when he needed to Last year John emailed home to say al Qaedas attack on the USS Cole was justified oh and by the way he was off to enroll in a Pakistani madrassa So Dad wired him a couple thousand b ucks which goes a long way in Bannu Aside from a glowing school report fr om his Imam that was the last Mr Lindh heard from Junior until he turned up brandishing an AK while battling US armed forces and declaring his approval of the events of September th John Walkers CV bears eloquent testament to his parents scrupulous observ ance of the Bay Areas First Commandment Thou shalt be nonjudgmental Y eah man Yemen Cool Whatevers your bag As one headline put it A Prod uct Of Bay Area Culture Exactly I thought But this being The San Franc isco Chronicle they were applying the label with pride Rhapsodizing about the areas religious tolerance and the way children are taught to accep t other cultures and value critical thinking about the US role in the w orld senior writer Louis Freedberg concluded that Walkers only misfortun e was that his search for identity intersected precisely with the World Tr ade Center attacks If not for this unfortunate intersection Walker migh t have become an idealistic doctor The President he said should allow the boy home and let him get his life back on track Wed want nothing les s for our own children who could easily have found themselves in a similar mess In fairness to the youth of northern California that last part is an unjus t slur The marvel is that after labouring under the twin burdens of the e ducation systems multicultural orthodoxies and the preening moral superior ity of their Boomer parents no more Bay Area teens have signed on with Mul lah Omar Nonetheless there is a difference between tolerance of other c ultures and the moral inertia displayed by the Lindhs We can in any case guess the limits of Marin Countys muchvaunted tolerance Imagine that the Marinated Muslim had instead announced that he was going to do what th e late CIA agent Mike Spann did at his age enlist in the Marines Would Marilyn Walker have seen that as a valid part of her sons selfdiscovery Or would she have got out her joss sticks and wailed Oh my God where did we go wrong Mom says shes proud of John but is taking the line he must have been b rainwashed From the look of him his brains the only thing thats been w ashed John Walker resembles one of those hairy smelly cadaverous vaguel y deranged guys who stumble up to you late at night at remote Greyhound sta tions and demand money for medication But right now thats shrewd imagepo sitioning President Bush seems to have bought the misguided line descri bing Walker as a poor fellow who thought he was fighting for a great cau se I cant see him as being unpatriotic says a neighbour This is whe re his journey led him And anyway as everyone says hes just a boy John Walker is a year old man though one can sympathize if protracted exposure to the Bay Areas critical thinking if only has left him in a state of arrested development For four decades supposedly nonjudgmenta l flowerchildren like Marilyn Walker have reflexively characterized CIA m en like Mike Spann as the dark agents of rightwing militarism We are enti tled to judge Marilyns son the comrade of Spanns killers as the dark ag ent of leftwing Marinism Raised by peaceniks and Marinated in tolerance he took up an AK in defence of misogynists and gaybashers not an int ernal contradiction but the logical reductio of the new lefts moral nulli ty Cocooned in one of the most prosperous enclaves on the planet he was t aught everything from Buddhism to Indian spirituality to Malcolm X ev erything except what it means to be an American citizen When a yearold girl wants an abortion the Marin County crowd insists t hat a womans right to choose is sacred and even parental notification ta boo Twentyyearold men make choices too John Walker chose to go to war against his own country Americans should respect his right to choose an d let him live with the consequences Im not in favour of trying him for treason Alan Dershowitz and the other highrent lawyers are already salivating over the possibility of a twoyear circus with attendant book deals and TV movies But there is another way suggested the other day by the Suns Peter Worthington In lacking th e benefits of an immersion in Bay Area critical thinking the teenage Wor thington volunteered for the Royal Canadian Navy but unlike Walkers apol ogists he at least treats him as an adult exercising free will As Mr Wor thington notes on page four of John Walkers US passport it states that any American who enlists in a foreign army can be stripped of his citizensh ip Mr Walker wants to be Abdul Hamid Mr Bush should honour his wishes Let us leave him to the Northern Alliance and let his fancypants Frisco l awyers petition to appear before the Kabul bar if there is one It would surely be grossly discriminatory to subject Mr Hamid to nonIslamic justi ce Mark Steyn Britishborn journalist Misguided boy deserves Afghan justi ce The Canadian National Post
