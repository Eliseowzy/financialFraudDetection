butterflies bunnies and egg hunts To capture the best moments in pictures make sure you are zoomwise First lets start with the basicsIMAGE Zoom settings are the focal lengths available to you They are labeled and measured in millimeters this measurement is actually the distance between the lens element and the film Zoom settings fall into categories wide angle less than mm normal mm mm and telephoto above mm Wide angle settings allow you to capture a broader scene without physicall y moving farther away Normal settings let you capture as much as one of you r eyes sees your angle of view with both eyes open is approximately mm an d about mm with one eye closed Since a camera has only one eye lens mm is considered normal Telephoto settings soar above mm magnifying the subject and narrowing the angle of view IMAGETo capture fields of springtime flowers or entire yards on film try using a setting such as mm or mm They will provide a sweeping view of spring color Remember also that early morning and late afternoon light intensifies spring hues Bright noontime sun is beautiful but will wash ou t your photos colors and cause your subjects to squint If midday is you r only chance to snap pictures then try for a bright cloudy day When photographing people and animals its best to use low telephoto settings such as mmmm These provide accurate facial and body proportions It also helps to keep your camera level with your subject rather than pointing downward or upward If youre snapping photos of small children this may mean getting down on their level The telephoto setting will also allow you to be farther away and less of a distraction to them After all the best kidshots are the spontaneous unposed ones Did you know that some Compact Point Shoot cameras offer zoom setti ngs that are as versatile as those found on SLR lenses You can capture springs finest moments with these pocketsized wonders Canon Elph II APS Camera IMAGE Wolf Low Price Yashica Zoomate QD Outfit IMAGE Wolf Low Price Zoom Tip Why are my prints blackened in each of the four corners Does it have something to do with my zoom lensIMAGE This is called the vignette effect and its most commonly seen in phot os taken with a single lens reflex SLR camera It occurs when you use the wrong size lens hood on the front of your lens while taking a wideangle shot The camera is actually photographing the edges of the hood If you look carefully through your SLR viewfinder you should be able to see the protruding hood before the picture is taken and correct the problem by either increasing your zoom magnification or removing the hood The vignet te effect also occurs when too many filters are stacked onto the front of the lens Simply remove the unnecessary filters or increase the zoom If it s too late and your prints already contain vignette edges simply ask your favorite Wolf Camera photo expert to crop the blackened areas out Digital Deals Digital cameras offer more than just quick computer images The Kodak DC and Olympus DZ use autofocus autoexposure longrange digit al zoom and sharp optical zoom to maximize versatility and produce printquality images Plus when you

optical or digital zoom Zoom is one of the great technological marvels of todays cameras Virtually every camera and camcorder lens sports some level of zoom capability But did you know there are two types of zoom Most of these products use an optical zoom system but some use digital zoom technology So whats the difference and which is the better zoom choice As a general rule optical zoom produces the clearest sharpest image results Optical zoom involves true lens element movement when magnifying or widening the subject area This high quality lens system is found on traditional point shoot cameras SLR lenses and is a feature of most digital cameras and camcorders Although the optical magnification power isnt as great as with digital zoom your digital images photographic prints and video footage are sharp clean and clear Digital zoom on the other hand uses a system of computerized enhancem ent called interpolation to magnify an image Its a common feature in today s camcorders and digital cameras Digital zoom picks up where the optical zo om leaves off and allows for much greater magnification But the tradeoff i s in the image quality Images viewed on a computer screen arent drastical ly affected but printed images and video footage can suffer a loss of clarit y and detail With camcorders especially steadiness becomes an issue a tripod is a must when using high digital zoom settings The best way to choose a zoom setting is to consider what you wish to do with the image If you plan to produce prints and enlargements or if fine detail is a must then consider using optical zoom only If high zoom powe r and monitorviewing are your priorities then try the digital zoom feature Zoom in on Camcorder Savings Your video footage never looked so good The Sony DCRTRV and
