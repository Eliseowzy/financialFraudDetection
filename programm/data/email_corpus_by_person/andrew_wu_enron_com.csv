square away this issue maybe around or or so My recollection of our original contract language was to capture all of the posttransition period CTCs as set forth in AB so maybe we just need to broaden or clarify what we mean by residual CTCs Ill actually be at Cal starting in the pm tomorrow so this could work out pretty well Otherwise Ill be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back in SFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar Dasovich youre speaking at it Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too Sorry for the short notice and I hope Ill at least be able to say hi to everyone tomorrow Andy Forwarded by Andrew WuHOUEES on A M Edwin Essandoh PM To Tim ES Andrew ES cc Subject Re CTC definition Sorry Guys should have ccd you Ed Forwarded by Edwin EssandohHOUEES on PM Edwin Essandoh PM To Roger ES Susan J ES Jeff nron Mona L nron cc Subject Re CTC definition Roger Thanks for the input It does need some refinement For that matter do y ou consider the definition of CTC charges adequate Andy Wu is going to be in San Francisco on Thursday and has agreed to discuss the language with Susa n Jeff andor Mona in Govt Affairs Ed Roger Yang PM To Edwin ES cc Susan J ES Jeff nron Mona Petrochko Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports Attached is a version of AB I refer you to pages through which discusses Sections through Residual CTCs may have two connotations The first connotation is the type of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period For example the California IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates From those frozen rates delive ry and procurement costs are subtracted What is left over residually is the recovery of CTCs The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs that are recovered after the frozen rate period Due to these two possible interpretations I believe that either the term residual CTCs needs to be defined or a better definition of the PreRolloff Period and PostRollof f Period After reading the cites that I referred to above if you believe the definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections and then I will be comfortable with the current language My concern was that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section that would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers and only benefit and protect Standard Offer customers Pursuant to Section the IOUs implemented co st recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section I a m worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a the PostRolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan s ie SDGEs rate cap You can contact Susan Mara Jeff Dasovich or Mona Petrochko in Government Affairs for better clarification if needed Edwin Essandoh AM To Tim ES cc Roger ES Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports The reference to but not including any extension pursuant to Section gii should have been deleted from the contract It was in a previou s contract which provided for an extension period but is not applicable here Tim We could forward corrected page to customer but I agree that it may not be necessary as it does not add anything but may unnecessarily alarm Customer Roger Can you suggest a definition youd be comfortable with which references the code section I have not seen the code but your point is valid although I was under the impression residual CTCs is understood i n the industry and the second issue as raisesd by Tim previously would be to maek sure an amendment to AB does not extend the PreRolloff Period My initial suggestion would be along the lines of PreRolloff Period shall mean with respect to each Facility t he period of time commencing with the Effective Date and ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs other than residual CTCs it remains authorized to collect after said date in its service territory under AB as in effect on the Effective Date but in an y event not later than March Ed Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel fax pgr To Edwin ES cc Subject Contract for Gart Sports Ed please see comments below regarding the Gart Sports contract How shou ld we handle Forwarded by Tim CarterHOUEES on AM Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports Tim Thanks for forwarding me the contract In Section a there is a definition for PostRolloff Period which states shall mean with respec t to each Facility the period of time commencing with the day after the last day of the PreRolloff Periodbut not including any extension period pursuant to Section gii The problem is that I cannot find Section gi in the contract Further the definition of PreRolloff Period which states ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs but excluding residual CTCs in its service territory under AB is ambiguous There are two possible solutions One possible solution is to define the term residual CTCs Another solution is to redraft the langua ge to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section and enacted by AB Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter PM Phone No tel fax pgr To Roger ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period ends differently than we expect The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with AB as noted in the attatched Gart contract We have however instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha t under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than I have not received a version of that contract Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book in California Correct me if I am wrong but if the end of the transition period ends earlier than priced then our mark for this deal should increas e because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a shorter period than expected Conversely if the rate freeze ends later th an how we priced it then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we had priced This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil e of our California portfolio My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is defined It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose ends Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of the transition period which is a critical date because the delivery risks hinge on that definition I just want to do some preventative maintenance such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future However we may proceed signing this contract if necessary I would just like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this deal As a matter of fact I would not even try to change the contract language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel

<25264351.1075843130050.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,andrew.wu@enron.com,2000-10-25 01:19:00,Re CTC definition Cc Mona and Dasovich Would one of you be available for about mins or so tomorrow pm Thurs to square away this issue maybe around or or so My recollection of our original contract language was to capture all of the posttransition period CTCs as set forth in AB so maybe we just need to broaden or clarify what we mean by residual CTCs Ill actually be at Cal starting in the pm tomorrow so this could work out pretty well Otherwise Ill be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back in SFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar Dasovich youre speaking at it Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too Sorry for the short notice and I hope Ill at least be able to say hi to everyone tomorrow Andy Forwarded by Andrew WuHOUEES on A M Edwin Essandoh PM To Tim ES Andrew ES cc Subject Re CTC definition Sorry Guys should have ccd you Ed Forwarded by Edwin EssandohHOUEES on PM Edwin Essandoh PM To Roger ES Susan J ES Jeff nron Mona L nron cc Subject Re CTC definition Roger Thanks for the input It does need some refinement For that matter do y ou consider the definition of CTC charges adequate Andy Wu is going to be in San Francisco on Thursday and has agreed to discuss the language with Susa n Jeff andor Mona in Govt Affairs Ed Roger Yang PM To Edwin ES cc Susan J ES Jeff nron Mona Petrochko Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports Attached is a version of AB I refer you to pages through which discusses Sections through Residual CTCs may have two connotations The first connotation is the type of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period For example the California IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates From those frozen rates delive ry and procurement costs are subtracted What is left over residually is the recovery of CTCs The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs that are recovered after the frozen rate period Due to these two possible interpretations I believe that either the term residual CTCs needs to be defined or a better definition of the PreRolloff Period and PostRollof f Period After reading the cites that I referred to above if you believe the definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections and then I will be comfortable with the current language My concern was that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section that would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers and only benefit and protect Standard Offer customers Pursuant to Section the IOUs implemented co st recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section I a m worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a the PostRolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan s ie SDGEs rate cap You can contact Susan Mara Jeff Dasovich or Mona Petrochko in Government Affairs for better clarification if needed Edwin Essandoh AM To Tim ES cc Roger ES Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports The reference to but not including any extension pursuant to Section gii should have been deleted from the contract It was in a previou s contract which provided for an extension period but is not applicable here Tim We could forward corrected page to customer but I agree that it may not be necessary as it does not add anything but may unnecessarily alarm Customer Roger Can you suggest a definition youd be comfortable with which references the code section I have not seen the code but your point is valid although I was under the impression residual CTCs is understood i n the industry and the second issue as raisesd by Tim previously would be to maek sure an amendment to AB does not extend the PreRolloff Period My initial suggestion would be along the lines of PreRolloff Period shall mean with respect to each Facility t he period of time commencing with the Effective Date and ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs other than residual CTCs it remains authorized to collect after said date in its service territory under AB as in effect on the Effective Date but in an y event not later than March Ed Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel fax pgr To Edwin ES cc Subject Contract for Gart Sports Ed please see comments below regarding the Gart Sports contract How shou ld we handle Forwarded by Tim CarterHOUEES on AM Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports Tim Thanks for forwarding me the contract In Section a there is a definition for PostRolloff Period which states shall mean with respec t to each Facility the period of time commencing with the day after the last day of the PreRolloff Periodbut not including any extension period pursuant to Section gii The problem is that I cannot find Section gi in the contract Further the definition of PreRolloff Period which states ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs but excluding residual CTCs in its service territory under AB is ambiguous There are two possible solutions One possible solution is to define the term residual CTCs Another solution is to redraft the langua ge to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section and enacted by AB Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter PM Phone No tel fax pgr To Roger ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period ends differently than we expect The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with AB as noted in the attatched Gart contract We have however instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha t under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than I have not received a version of that contract Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book in California Correct me if I am wrong but if the end of the transition period ends earlier than priced then our mark for this deal should increas e because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a shorter period than expected Conversely if the rate freeze ends later th an how we priced it then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we had priced This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil e of our California portfolio My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is defined It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose ends Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of the transition period which is a critical date because the delivery risks hinge on that definition I just want to do some preventative maintenance such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future However we may proceed signing this contract if necessary I would just like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this deal As a matter of fact I would not even try to change the contract language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel
