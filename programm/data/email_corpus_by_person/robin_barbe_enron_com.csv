McMichael Jr Ed Barbe Robin Subjectponderosa plant service events for gas days june Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days I hope we dont need Events of June Gas service to the plant has been challenging Lonestar Pipeline is runnin g a pig for June Lonestar told us that roughly would be cut A pparently Friday May Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti es the maintenance information He also indicated that our Lonestarrep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was LonestarCarthage and LonestarKaty Plant Neither of the plants supp liers ApacheCinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June Cuts did occur as we were warned Of the total nomination of M M MM flowed for todays gas flow The supplier breakout is ApacheCi nergy MM and WilliamsMM Yesterday Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for todays flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a backup The plant ca n burn No low sulfur fuel oil Mike indicated that the plant would not w ant to do that and hadnt burned oil in quite some time I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera ge with the suppliers He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t he plant I told him that I wasnt familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of its size they probably have remote control capabilities If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language Th e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply pointpoints into Lonestars system from a list of pri mary or secondary points in Exhibit A If the plants transportation contr act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in to Lonestars system at a location that will flow on the plants transporta tion agreement If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels Yeste rday I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy T om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didnt have a copy of the amendment Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points I told Tom at Cinergy that my primary concern w as flowing gas supply to the plant Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event I told him I didnt interpretthe force majuere lan guage that way The force majuere language addresses freezeoffs and line breaks but not maintenance I also told him that the contract has a provis ion for transportation interruption In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op erational issues and not monetary issues I told him we could address the financial resolution per the contract after the event was over I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th e pipe cutting back their gas supply Events of June This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy They are supplying MM at AquilaKaty into Lonestar for June Williams is

hope we dont need Events of June Gas service to the plant has been challenging Lonestar Pipeline is runnin g a pig for June Lonestar told us that roughly would be cut A pparently Friday May Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti es the maintenance information He also indicated that our Lonestarrep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was LonestarCarthage and LonestarKaty Plant Neither of the plants supp liers ApacheCinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June Cuts did occur as we were warned Of the total nomination of M M MM flowed for todays gas flow The supplier breakout is ApacheCi nergy MM and WilliamsMM Yesterday Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for todays flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a backup The plant ca n burn No low sulfur fuel oil Mike indicated that the plant would not w ant to do that and hadnt burned oil in quite some time I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera ge with the suppliers He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t he plant I told him that I wasnt familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of its size they probably have remote control capabilities If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language Th e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply pointpoints into Lonestars system from a list of pri mary or secondary points in Exhibit A If the plants transportation contr act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in to Lonestars system at a location that will flow on the plants transporta tion agreement If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels Yeste rday I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy T om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didnt have a copy of the amendment Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points I told Tom at Cinergy that my primary concern w as flowing gas supply to the plant Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event I told him I didnt interpretthe force majuere lan guage that way The force majuere language addresses freezeoffs and line breaks but not maintenance I also told him that the contract has a provis ion for transportation interruption In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op erational issues and not monetary issues I told him we could address the financial resolution per the contract after the event was over I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th e pipe cutting back their gas supply Events of June This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy They are supplying MM at AquilaKaty into Lonestar for June Williams is buying MM at Carthage and MM at HLPL for June Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju ne Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted

Jr Ed CcBills Lisa Lyons Dan Ward Charles Barbe Robin SubjectPonderosa Pine Energy Partners Ltd PPEP After I learned that Robin was preparing a summary to bring you up to speed with where we are gaswise wPPEP I offered to draft something that might help put us all on the same page and allow her to work on other things imp ortant to your group PPEP owns a MW plant located in Cleburne TX The plant has three gas related agreements that require daily management a gas transportation agreement wLone Star a gas supply agreement wApache which is being managed by Cinergy and a gas supply agreement wWilliams Prior to June these agreements were administered under a service agreement between PPEP fka Tenaska IV Texas Partners Ltd or TIVTP and Tenas ka Gas Co Under that agreement Tenaska Gas Co TGC provided scheduli ng services reconciled gas activity to invoices and bought and sold gas o n behalf of TIVTP As consideration for services provided TGC received a per unit fee that if the agreement were still in effect would have amount ed to approximately Dth in That fee is prevalent in the PPA as it relates to Brazos gas purchase options and electric pricing after the year the gas supply agreements expire The TGC gas agreement was terminated on June at which time Pondero sa Pine Energy LLC PPE a whollyowned subsidiary of Delta Power Co LLC DPC acquired all of the entities that own general partnership inte rests in TIVTP whose name changed to PPEP one year later Just pri or to PPEs acquisition ENA acquired the only limited partnership interest from LGE In conjunction with PPEs acquisition ENA entered into two service agreements with PPE a Consulting Services Agreement unde r which either party receives cost plus for services rendered there has been no business conducted under this agreement and a Corporate Servi ces Agreement under which ENA is entitled to receive cost plus for acco unting tax finance legal and HR services it provides to PPE PPEs purchase agreement provided for a transition of gas services to ENA o ver days In conjunction with the transition ENA and PPE developed bu t never executed a gas agency agreement under which the ENA Texas Desk pro vided services similar to those provided under the TGC gas service agreemen t Per Weil course of performance is sufficient to consider that agreemen t binding as a verbal arrangement Under that verbal arrangement the EN A Texas Desk received a fee of Dth in by our calculations th at fee has increased to Dth in PPE is current through Novemb er on the payment of these fees In addition to the status of the PPEENA gas agency agreement two issues w ere raised to a consciousness level shortly after the filing of our petitio n In what appears to be related to the sale of HPL to AEP payments that were made by PPEP to ENA for further payment to Lone Star between April and Nov ember were never remitted by ENA to Lone Star In order to prevent th e Lone Star agreement from going into default PPEP was forced to pay Lone Star directly effectively causing PPEP to double pay its transportation costs for the period Revenue that was received by ENA for the resale of gas on behalf of PPEP i e due to an electric production schedule that didnt utilize full contra ct entitlements for the month of November was never remitted to PPEP Taken together these two items create a MM claim against ENA by PPEP Additionally we learned shortly after the bankruptcy that the electric p roduction schedule had lead to the development of a large imbalance on the Lone Star pipeline Given ENAs limited capability to transact on physical gas and Lone Stars physical limitations it has been difficult to work off this imbalance However the fact that the plant is generally short ga s in summer production months ie the plant utilizes approximately Dthd at full production vs its Dth daily contract entitlements the imbalance should start to reverse this summer Its my understanding that the facility has fairly liberal balancing provisions wLone Star An invoice for gas agency services since the filing of the bankruptcy was p resented to PPE today Based on conversations that I had wDPC earlier thi s year we suspect due to the limited capacity in which ENA can perform an d the claim described above that PPE will decline to pay the invoice ENA at DPCs request developed an RFP to solicit bids for a new gas agency s ervice provider earlier this year While we have received no indications t hat the RFP has been issued it is my understanding that DPC has had conver sations with one or more parties that may be willing to provide gas agency services While not crucial to ENAs decisionmaking we have no way of kn owing how these conversations have progressed or if DPC is presently in a p osition to assume the role of gas portfolio manager However this is deal falls into the SPE category by virtue of a total re turn swap between ENE and KBC bank which loaned PPE of the total funds needed to acquire the entities that own general partnership interests in P PEP The total return swap was entered into contemporaneously with PPEs a cquisition in June The total return swap agreement appears to be in default ENE has not performed under that agreement since the bankruptcy fi ling Likewise the KBCPPE loan agreement also appears to be in default We are aware that DPC attempted to put its equity interests in PPE back to KBC in December under the loan agreement and that its exercise lead to th e filing of a lawsuit by KBC We are also aware that KBC and DPC are in di scussions concerning a resolution of their differences and a possible restr ucturing of the investment but we have not to date been party to those d iscussions Lisa Bills is responsible for the total return swap and bank t he bank relationship on this deal She is presently developing a strategy document for dealing with this investment which appears to the deal team t o be a net liability due to the current market for power plant investments and the relationship with Brazos Because the SPE status and outright ownership of the limited partnership i nterest we intend to continue in our collective service roles ie rely ing on DPC for authorization of our decisions until such time that the str ategy can be advanced through the approval process Lisa views DPCs reac tion to the gas agency service fee invoice to be a key part of this process I hope this helpsplease let me know if you need more
