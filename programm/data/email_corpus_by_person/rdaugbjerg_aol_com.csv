fcgrid As many of you know my son is a Cadet at the United State s Air Force Academy I received this today and I believe that it needs to b e read and understood by every Americanffscgrid par par par fcgrid ffscgrid par fcgrid line This was written by my academic advisor at the Aca demy He was not only one of the most brilliant men Ive ever met but al so an individual who combined that brilliance with common sense to lead oth ers His words are the ones that havent been heard yet but I believe wil l come to be true before we have the chance to recover from this initial tr agedyline ffscgrid par fcgrid From Dr Tony Kern Lt Col USAF Retline ffsc grid par fcgrid Recently I was asked to look at the recent events throug h the lens of military history I have joined the cast of thousands who ha ve written an open letter to Americansline line line Dear friends and fellow Americans September line line Like everyo ne else in this great country I am reeling from last weeks attack on our sovereignty But unlike some I am not reeling from surprise As a career s oldier and a student and teacher of military history I have a different pe rspective and I think you should hear it This war will be won or lost by t he American citizens not diplomats politicians or soldiersline line Le t me briefly explainline line In spite of what the media and even our o wn government is telling us this act was not committed by a group of menta lly deranged fanatics To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest o f mistakes This attack was committed by a ferocious intelligent and dedic ated adversary Dont take this the wrong way I dont admire these men and I deplore their tactics but I respect their capabilities The many parall els that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropo s Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent Am erica but also because we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of c aves years after we think this war is over just like my fathers genera tion had to do withline the formidable Japanese in the years following WW IIline line These men hate the United States with all of their being an d we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment Napoleon perhaps the worlds greatest combination of soldier and statesman stated the moral is to the physical as three is to one Patton thought the French man underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more important in battle than physical strength Our enemies are willing better said anxious to give their lives for their cause ffscgri d par par fcgrid How committed are we America And for how longline lin e In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction the recent attack de monstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught to most military officers worldwide namely simplicity security and surprise When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been trained at our own Air War College it made perfect sense to me This wasline not a random act of violence and we can expect the same sort of military compete nce to be displayed in the battle to come ffscgrid par par fcgrid This war will escalate with a good portion of it happeni ng right here in the good ol US of Affscgrid par par fcgrid These men will not go easily into the night They do not fear us We must not fear them In spite of our overwhelming conventional s trength as the worlds only superpower a truly silly term we are the u nderdog in this fight As you listen to the carefully scripted rhetoric des igned to prepare us for the march for war please realize that America is n ot equipped or seriously trained for the battle ahead To be certain our s oldiers are much better than the enemy and we have some excellent counter terrorist organizations but they are mostly trained for hostage rescues airfield seizures or the occasional body snatch which may come in han dy We will be fighting a war of annihilation because if their early effo rts are any indication our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last m an Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming They have alre ady deployed their forces in as many as countries and are likely living the lives of everyday citizens Simply put our soldiers will be tasked wi th a search and destroy mission on multiple foreign landscapes and the pub lic must be patient and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be wo rked outline line For the most part our military is still in the proces s of redefining itself and presided over by men and women who grew up with and were promoted because they excelled in Cold War doctrine strategy and tactics This will not be linear warfare there will be no clear cente rs of gravity to strike with high technology weapons Our vast technologic al edge will certainly be helpful but it will not be decisive Perhaps the perfect metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the terrorists th emselves aboard the hijacked aircraft this will be a knife fight and it will be won or lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers no t by software or smart bombs We must also be patient with our military lea dersline line Unlike Americans who are eager to put this messy time behi nd us our adversaries have time on their side and they will use it They plan to fight a battle of attrition hoping to drag the battle out until th e American public loses its will to fight This might be difficult to belie ve in this euphoric time of flag waving and patriotism but it is generally acknowledged that America lacks the stomach for a long fight We need only look as far back as Vietnam when North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap line also a military history teacher defeated the United States of Americ a without ever winning a major tactical battle American soldiers who march ed to war cheered on by flag waving Americans in were reviled and spat upon less than three years later when they returned Although we hope that Usama Bin Laden is no Giap he is certain to understand and employ thelin e concept We can expect not only large doses of pain like the recent attac ks but also less audacious sand in the gears tactics ranging from live stock infestations to attacks at water supplies and power distribution faci litiesffscgrid par fcgrid line These attacks are designed to hit us in our comfor t zone forcing the average American to pay more and play less and eventu ally eroding our resolve But it can only work if we let it It is clear to me that the will of the American citizenry you and I is the center of gravity the enemy has targeted It will be the fulcrum upon which victory o r defeat will turn He believes us to be soft impatient and selfcentered He may be right but if so we must change The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz the most often quoted and least read military theorist in his tory says that there is a remarkable trinity of war that is composed of the will of the people the political leadership of the government and the chance and probability that plays out on the field of battle in that order Every American citizen was in the crosshairs of last Tuesda ys attack not just those that were unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center or Pentagon The will of the American people will decide this war If we are to win it will be because we have what it takes to persever e through a few more hits learn from our mistakes improvise and adapt If we can do that we will eventually prevail ffscgrid par par fcgrid Everyone Ive talked to In the past few days has shared a common frustration saying in one form or another I just wish I could do something You are already doing it Just keep faith in America and conti nue to
