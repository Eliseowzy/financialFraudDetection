BURY host Rolling power blackouts bankrupt utilities skyrocketing electricity price s Unidentified Man It is the most volatile commodity in the world BURY Are power generators gouging consumers Unidentified Woman I think its pretty appalling that the folks who sel l us power can charge whatever they want Mr KENNETH L LAY Chairman Enron And every time theres a shortage or a little bit of a price spike it is always collusion or conspiracy or some thing I mean it always makes people feel better that way BURY And right in the middle a federal agency youve probably never heard of Mr CURTIS HEBERT Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission They di dnt build this monopolistic system overnight and we wont change it overn ight either BURY Tonight Power Play Whos to Blame for the Energy Crisis Announcer From ABC News this is NIGHTLINE Substituting for Ted Koppel an d reporting from Washington Chris Bury BURY California is known as the great American incubator From hem lines t o HulaHoops the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east That is why so many states are paying close attention to Californias tro ubled attempt at deregulating electricity Last week California Governor G ray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power companies The president said no Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue the federal agency that regulates electricity prices More on that later But first the results of a new ABC NewsWashington Post poll It suggests that President Bush is developing an energy problem When asked what they t hink of the presidents performance on energy a clear majority percent say they disapprove Thats up percent since Mr Bush released his ene rgy plan When asked if they think the United States is heading into an ene rgy crisis six in Americans answer yes TEXT ABC News POLL The Washington Post Margin of Error How do you rate the presidents performance on energy June May Disapprove Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis Yes No BURY California is already there For months now The New York Times and t he public broadcasting program Frontline have teamed up to investigate T heir collaboration Blackout airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations I t documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling power on the open market Its like the New York Yankees against the Toled o Mud Hens Unidentified Woman We didnt use his five because their minimum was yo u know higher than what we were willing to pay Unidentified Man Ill sell you now BURY VO On one side companies such as Enron the Texas energy broker t rade electricity like any other commodity A sophisticated trading operatio n buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day Its the la rgest company of its kind in the world Unidentified Man See what Im saying KELLY CRS This is Kelly BURY VO On the other side in this converted department store in Sacrame nto is Californias trading team Unidentified Man This is the operations center This is thethis is th e location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California energy requirements BURY VO Here employees drafted from the states water department go hea dtohead with the pros from Enron and other companies Since the cos t to California has skyrocketed from billion to an estimated billion this year an increase of percent And the demand for electricity up less than percent OC In their documentary reporters for The New York Times and Frontline address a fundamental question whos to blame Narrating this segment is Frontline correspondent Lowell Bergman Unidentified Man Our forecast reserves look like theyd be pretty thin over the peak as well Unidentified Man How much is LOWELL BERGMAN reporting VO The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by C alifornias failure to build any major power plants over the last decade d espite a booming economy Mr LAY I mean we have a supplydemand imbalance Too much demand too li ttle supply in California BERGMAN VO Not everyone agrees Consumer advocates in California accuse the generators of actually withholding supply Ms NETTIE HOGE Executive Director TURN The idea that all of a sudden w e had a supply crunch is preposterous What happened is all of a sudden t he new plant owners and the traders like Mr Lays organization looked at the data and figured out how to manipulate the market As soon as that hap pened the prices never went down again If it was totally a supply problem why would we have excess prices at in the morning on Christmas Day w hen nobody but Santa is working BERGMAN VO The generators in turn say they shut down plants for routin e winter maintenance Mr LAY Every time theres a shortage or a little bit of a price spike it s always collusion or conspiracy or something I mean it always makes peo ple feel better that way BERGMAN But you know as well as I do that the priceits nice for a busin ess Mr LAY Yeah BERGMAN Youre in the business ofof making money for your shareholders Mr LAY Mmhmm BERGMAN Right as a company Mr LAY Yeah BERGMAN So you would be foolish as you said to turn down the kind of mon ey you could make this past winter in California Isisnt there a Mr LAY III think you put words in my mouth out there BERGMAN OK Mr LAY I said wewe made some money in California We made some money ac ross the country and around the world I mean and as I tell my friends in California Enron was doing quite well before California imploded Unidentified Man So you cant blame the Enrons I mean theyre the guy sthatsthats what they do They try to make as much money from the mon ey that they get invested You blame the regulators BERGMAN VO Across the country tucked in an out of the way building behi nd Union Station in Washington DC sits the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm ission or FERC FERCs commissioners are appointed by the president and con trol a billion energy sector critical to Americas economy With the c oming of deregulation state control over wholesale electricity rates passe d to the federal government making FERC the final arbiter of just and reas onable rates Its a power FERC has been reluctant to use Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott who convinced President Cli nton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in In January President Bush made him the FERC chairman and Hebert has made no bones about where he stands on free markets Mr HEBERT The rules of competition govern that economies work that choic e works Its why were American We inherently like choice Its why we le ft the mother country We didnt like the rules they were setting We wante d to make our own rules We want our own choices and we believe that works BERGMAN OK but is electricity different Mr HEBERT Its a transition It takes some time Look they didnt build this monopolistic system overnight and we wont change it overnight eithe r Mr WILLIAM MASSEY FERC Commissioner Without some effective price contro l this summer I fear for the worst BERGMAN VO William Massey is a FERC commissioner a Democrat who has fo und himself in opposition to his chairman Unidentified Man Mr Massey what is the nub of the disagreement that y ou have with Mr Hebert Mr MASSEY I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement a bout the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices I think its long past time for this agency to step in andand impose a te mporary time out on the markets Mr HEBERT Well that is the problem because these people are saying tempo rary but they dont mean temporary Its kind of like the temporary rent c ontrol you have in New York Its not temporary at all Matter of fact you know in Washington DC we dont do temporary very well and thats a pro blem BERGMAN VO In fact late last year after six months of unrelenting high prices in California the FERC finally did declare Californias rates unju st and unreasonable but took no action Governor GRAY DAVIS Governor California So they found these people guil ty a year ago They just havent agreed on the sentence BERGMAN Well we talked with Curt Hebert And we got Gov DAVIS Well thats you know BERGMAN Thats what Gov DAVIS Lots of luck BERGMAN What do you mean Lots of luck Gov DAVIS Because BERGMAN Hes the federalhes the guy you are turning to to give you the money Gov DAVIS He is the chairman of the commission But he has not been overl y sympathetic to California Hes more of an ideologue than a problem solve r BERGMAN Well hes saying you just want him to give you shortterm relief price caps which wont solve the problem Gov DAVIS Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already enormou sly wealthy energy companies BURY How much blame do the energy companies really deserve BERGMAN Watch youryour heating bills your natural gas bills which are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bill And dont think t hat this couldnt happen where you are BURY And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself Those questions when we come back Announcer This is ABC News NIGHTLINE brought to you by Commercial break BURY Joining us from Boston Lowell Bergman the correspondent for tomorro ws Frontline broadcast From our Los Angeles bureau Laura Holson a bus iness correspondent for The New York Times whos been covering the Califor nia energy crisis And here in Washington Joe Kahn who reports on energy and economics for The New York Times Laura just before the break we heard California Governor Davis blaming th e energy companies and the federal regulators How much of his argument is sinking in In other words whom do Californians blame for this Ms LAURA HOLSON The New York Times The interesting thing is Californian s blame everybody for this apfor what has happened with the energy crisis They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis tha t started you know a year ago if you really you know look at when pric es starting going up They are angry at their utilities who they feel have failed them They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships with their utilities and they feel that theyve been cheated And they are very angry with the power generators in particular who they feel are char ging them just exorbitant amounts for energy In particular there was a company last week a power generator that said i t charged consumers rather the utilities nearly per megawat t hour which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour And when th ey heard this they were outraged They just thought you know How can th is be How can we get in their terms kind of ripped off by power generat ors who are using them to make you know a lot of money BURY Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight sug gesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on ener gy How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington Mr JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Well clearly thePresident Bush and the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the polls to select a new president a slew of new power plants will be online in California Electricity prices presumably will come down quite a bit a nd their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the pol ls Its not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commit ment This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the De mocrats now in control of the Senate I think you can expect to see a legis lative initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in California Some Republicans may sign on to that Some have already indicat ed that they will Its going to be a real knockdown political flightfigh t in Washington over what the strategy ought to be BURY Lowell Bergman talk a little bit about that free market activity tha t Joe just mentioned We saw the clip from your documentary with thethe t raders from Enron pitted against thethe buyers from California And I mus t say it really did look like a mismatch BERGMAN Well in fact some of the people at Enron told us that they welco me the day when PGE and Southern California Edison the regular utilities get back in the marketplace because they do feel like theyve got them if you will outgunned Andbut I should point out to the audience that when Laura was talking about this a megawatt hour which was Duke Energy Company the normal price if you will the standard price for a megawatt h our was around or less So the level of profit that were talking about is what people are upset about And the problem here isis primarily that in a free market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up i n particular theres no limit to what could becould be charged when you get close to that area of scarcity with electricity Electricity truly is d ifferent and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary hes the CEO of Enr on it is the most volatile commodity in the world BURY Yet at the same time Joe we are seeing electricity traded as if it were oil or soybeans or steel I mean how is electricity different Mr KAHN Well for economic reasons its different in ain a couple of k ey respects For one thing its an absolutely vital commodity People aren t prepared to do without it Moreover electricity powers every other part of the economy So its one of these sort of fundamental rights that we h ave In fact as far back as the New Deal Franklin Roosevelt made clear th at electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legisla tion guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity prices BURY But just and reasonable electricity prices Laura do you want to pic k up the question of well who determines whats just and reasonable here Ms HOLSON Well its very clear that President Bush believes that the mar ket you know sets whats just and reasonable And you know that has not been what Governor Davis has said at all He believes that because this is a commodity that people you know believe is guaranteed that there should be some price cap on it Its an interesting if you will situation when business and politics kind of intersect Governor Davis said very early on that he did not want two things to happen in California One is that the ut ilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for consumers And hes in a very tight spot right now because those two thing s that he did not want to happen indeed have happened And it only looks li ke it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can ex pect another hours of blackouts BURY Laura we have to take a break But when we come back we want to add ress the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes natu rally to them Back with our guests in a moment Commercial break BURY Were back with Frontlines Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe Kahn of The New York Times Joe arent these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to b e doing which is maximaximizing profits and to get the biggest return fo r their shareholders Mr KAHN Sure Thats their responsibility Theythey have no excuse for arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if th e market will bear a higher price BURY Lowell Bergman in your documentary do you find any evidence that th e power companies areare gouging consumers or doing anything illegal BERGMAN Well illegality no one really has any serious evidence although there have been lots of allegations and theres been lots of speculation a bout it But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times t hat some of the companies are starting to realize it seems that even thou gh they are owed hundreds of millions in some cases million or more s till by these bankrupt utilities theyre going to have to take a hair cut as Governor Davis describes it Theyre going to have to make some bargain And I think we may BURY Let me jump in there What do you mean theyre going to have to get a hair cut BERGMAN Well apparently thats Governor Daviss way of telling them that theyre going to have to take less to aless than a full dollar payment f or what they are owed and that there has to be some kind of settlement her e of between the various parties other were nototherwise we wont see a ny progress BURY Lowell one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow t he money And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administrat ion accusations have been made that the Bush administration is too cozy w ith the power companies and the power company regulators What did you find in your reporting BERGMAN Well we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about it I mean about his relationship with Ken Lay the head of Enron the fac t that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton You kn ow the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune company to hold pr esidential office in the history of the United States Sobut they are ver y open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and wi th the people who they feel comfortable with BURY Laura Holson this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting fr om Californias misery as it were I suppose Californians find that partic ularly infuriating Ms HOLSON Its funny in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up near there there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco ers which is as we all know a football team and the Dallas Cowboys And that seems to be replaced if you will with consumers in California who look at Texas genat you know a lot of the power generators which are based in Texas and who they feel now are just you know making a lot of money off them Itstheres always been a rivalry between those two states And no w I think its deeply personal because its hitting consumers or as they b elieve it its hitting them in their pocket books BURY Joe Kahn how long before these new power plants are going to be comi ng on line And before they do or in the time before they do whatwhat i s it that the federal government can do to help California out Mr KAHN Well itit will probably be about months before sufficient n ew power comes online in California to start substantially changing the sup ply and demand equation there And thats a very speedy pace Thats with a very expedited permit process for new plants The governor in California h as put a lot of effort into building new platsplants quickly BURY So what happens between now and then Mr KAHN Well thats the question Thats the debate The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act in fact so me people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure that just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all ti mes It cant just selectively choose the times And it has already found a t the end of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable BURY So whats it doing about that Mr KAHN Well itsits tried a variety of compromise measures so far v ery limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during eme rgency hours So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to re ducing the overall electricity bill in California BURY Laura Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls Presiden t Bush has made it pretty clear that hes not going to lean that way What options does Governor Davis have Ms HOLSON You know itsagain hes stuck in this place where itit doe snt look like hes got any kind of real out I mean he can try to demand He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators but if the fe deral government doesnt step in he really cant do anything The interest ing thing at least I see kind of going forward is how Californians have r eally adapted to a really you know awful situation Theres a law thats being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a blackou t so they can plan I mean weve almost turned intoif anybody remembers traveling through Italy during their college days you always kind of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because they tol d you a day ahead of time And thats very much whats happening in Califor nia where theyre warning people you know two days an hour you know on e day ahead of time so that they can prepare BURY Thats a pretty dark scenario Lowell we just have a few seconds lef t what lessons should the rest of the country take from Californias crisi s BERGMAN Well watch youryour heating bills your natural gas bills whic h are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills And dont th ink that this couldnt happen where you are And I think that the industry itself is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may in fac t impact on the future of deregulation nationally BURY Lowell Bergman Laura Holson Joe Kahn thank you so much for joining us tonight BERGMAN Thank you Mr KAHN Thank you Ms HOLSON Thank you BURY When we come back an update on a NIGHTLINE
