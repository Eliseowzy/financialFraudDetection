you on the th Original Message From Steve Mitnick ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESSteveMitnickCSMitnickearthlinkEnetE NRONcom Sent Monday May AM To Crenshaw Shirley Cc Subject Energy Leader Consulting Generation Evaluator EGE Shirley As requested herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski The presentation on the EGE tools applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday May might I request it be set for late afternoon as my other appointments are the next day And as Vince will recall I was CoLeader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly and developer of the Ramp Up Real Time check and Electric Strategy tools Presently I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting ELC Background The US power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively Utilities who still control most power plants endeavor to adopt the entrants methods Yet inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decadesold habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling Many utilities notwithstanding the industrywide trend towards profit maximization cling to ingrained routines Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale A utility may operate a relatively small system fewer than a dozen plants A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers playing the wholesale market at the margin For a variety of reasons utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units let alone shut down any even temporarily or seasonally Economically inefficient units continue to be committed week after week and run in the halfload range EGE Objectives EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines Taking into account transmission and reliability factors the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant I An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or longterm wholesale power transaction with a utility or to price wholesale power more aggressively to take market share from the utility ie compel changes in unit commitment habits II An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition III A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utilitys unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized Specific EGE Concepts EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities It produces indicative statistics such as a the frequency distribution of starts per week b the frequency distribution of starts by dayminute segment during the week c the frequency distribution of load level d the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start e average heat rate and approximate fullyallocated cost in the halfload range f average ramp rate from the halfload range g the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours and h forcedoff maintenance outage rate where indicated Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by monthyear in some cases by temperature range They can be by regional wholesale prices as well EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data EGE is now updated for the th quarter through December EGE st quarter through March will be available approximately June EGE also compares and ranks generating units commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility as well as other regional generators Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the halfload level for lengthy time periods without an apparent reliability basis splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units Other EGE supporting data i planned maintenance schedule where indicated j actual maximum generating capacity k actual minimum generating capacity actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from governmentreported values l average heat rate in the fullload range and m average heat rate in the threequarterload range With respect to a generating units average heat rate in the halfload threequarterload and fullload ranges it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities and changes in recent years in these parameters The RealWorld Example of Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE In the th quarter for instance one highcost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning times and committed for the whole day in all but two cases Arguably there are power products that could substitute for this routine in part at least at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy Another highcost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn nine times and committed for most of the coming week At another plant two highcost units were operated too often in the expensive halfload range some hours and threequarterload range another to hours they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels Again there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy Offering of Energy Leader Consulting ELC EGE is a procedure not a software package or data base ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities ELC transfers its knowledge about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straightforward fourstep process Enron would select one to three target utilities ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities Employing this realworld analysis as a pedagogic tool ELC in a oneday seminar with Enron personnel would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future without the assistance of ELC Optionally ELC would provide EGE supporting data quarterly to Enron The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program virtually all fossil fuel units Parameters that are incorporated and the data set format will be specified upon request Custom modifications will be considered Steven A Mitnick Chief Executive Officer Energy Leader Consulting st Street NW Washington DC voice fax nergyLeadercom
