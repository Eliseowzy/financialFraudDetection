Virginia PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a statesponsored billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility into bankruptcy The PUC will meet today but had not put on its agenda th e regulatory changes which were agreed upon last April by the utility and t he governor If the PUC doesnt implement the changes by Friday the state or the utility could back out of the plan The political reality is that Ed ison is likely going to slouch toward Chapter The legislature has d ays to approve the plan which has been faulted as too generous to SCE and o f little use to consumers and creditors while throwing California into the power generation business SCE has a long line of creditors awaiting back payments including at least power generators that have sued it It only takes three to throw the utility into involuntary bankruptcy Some analyst s think that risk is already very high CAMINUS ENERGY SOFTWARE

Act before June to receive off Restructuring Today Wednesday June Nye thinks Bush may lead US to retail power competition But when will Texas link with North American grid First of several articles Erle Nye TXU CEO has taken over the reins at EEI from John Rowe the Exel on coCEO The two spoke to the press at EEIs annual meeting in New Orlea ns yesterday They had briefed the vice president when he was putting together the White Houses new energy policy Does Nye think Bush will lead a national switch from monopoly to competitio n in electricity as he did in Texas Bush believes in it and led the move to open up Texas Nye said and when t he time is right he expects the president to take the leadership to open u p retail markets Nye speaks for the investor owned electric industry but as a Texas grid own er at TXU he knows a lot about ERCOT We asked him when Texas ERCOT will hook up to the North American grid Its already connected for up to mw Nye replied but its a DC tie and the power is easy to control His short answer was that ERCOT will build more ties to the east and west w hen its worth doing It wont happen until theres a strong financial dri ver The grid grew up around load he reminded and between the huge easte rn and western interties exists a large nothingness where load is small or nonexistent If a need arises for another connection between ERCOT and SPP he knows exac tly how much it will cost for another DC line because theyve done that If someone has to build six or higher kv lines at major interconnection points then Nye has to ask what the investor gets in return The president talks of it like the Interstate Highway system Nye noted wit h some skepticism Is not Nyes view based on fear of FERC jurisdiction Were all going to be subject to FERC anyway Nye asserted If you want to make it subject to FERC pass a law Nye advised Will FERC favor the connection he asked rhetorically Nye predicts FERC would look at a connection proposal under todays circum stances and determine that a lump of investment that large can be better s pent somewhere else At the bottom line on the question of connecting the East and West there ha s to be a way to make some money Nye reminded And any time would be DC he assumes since AC power flow is too hard to control The idea of a national grid is premature he predicted but it will happe n when the economics justify it when the rate of return justifies it We asked Nye what is a good rate of return in todays world For transmission what is a return that would motivate investment in the gr id North of to do whats important and it would need to be more in a more challenging environment If its real easy to do and anybody can do it you can get by with the low er return Nye added Williams CEO Keith Bailey asks why he should invest for a small return whe n he can get in broadband we noted Nye noted that broadband has more risk too Nye respects departing EEI chairman John Rowe and intends little change in management style at EEI He shares Rowes positive view of where the indus try is headed and should go he said Rowe is more competition minded than earlier EEI top leaders and Nye is even more procompetition than Rowe Nye believes in the Texas retail power competition bill and is keyed up to do well when the market really opens for all Jan Nye tells us hell be active on behalf of EEI members and will be accessible He expects to lead the industry in those areas where we are collectively t ogether and hopefully compromise on those areas where we may have some diff erent views EEI has come a long way over the decade or so that weve been writing about it How does Nye perceive that difference He finds Tom Kuhn and staff sensitive to changes in the industry and in the views of members Nye replied The industry is obviously going through a remarkable transition and ge nerally speaking its all positive positive for the nation for the consum ers and for our shareholders Nye observed of the growing competition EEI has been very progressive in moving staff into the areas that are more important and in reducing efforts in those areas that are less important less valuable to the membership and being responsive he added Nye has seen large members drop out of EEI especially in California where some members have said Weve sold the generation and are not doing marketing so EEI isnt quite the organization for us The association has set up a dues structure to lure transmission only and g eneration only companies Does Nye see the investorowned electric utilities breaking up over the yea rs to come He expects various firms to take different paths with some disaggregat ion of the traditional integrated form Nye knows EEI members represent a spectrum of views but views can be consis tent if not identical EEI members have always had differences based on differing business plans a nd asset configurations But the industry has an absolute need for an industry association to repre sent those critical views At the end of the day we all recognize that we have much in common and the refore we need to speak collectively and with one voice Nye added Tauzins attempt at Calif price cap compromise fails Barton drops action on Calif help bill House Energy Commerce Committee Billy Tauzin RLa was to bring his hig hly divided committee back together this morning to win support for HR the Electricity Emergency Relief Act to help California The measure has been blocked by partisan differences on wholesale price con trols Thus Tauzin canceled the meeting before it started A bit later Joe Barton RTex chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy Air Quality announced a switch in strategy dropping the subcommitteeadopted measure The Democrats assumption of power in the Senate may have been a key factor in his decision since Chairman Jeff Bingagman DNM could prevent action o n the bill Barton had gotten through his subcommittee Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has been chilly to the bill without price controls Some provisions have been adopted by the feds and the California government Barton added citing fixing Path boosting financial help f or the poor and better treatment of QFs Barton opined that by the time he could get a compromise adopted it would b e too late for any benefit this summer His strategy now is to focus on the longterm provisions in the Bush nationa l energy policy Bingaman the new Democratic chairman of the Energy Natural Resources Com mittee intends to block the Bush energy and environment program and start afresh Bingaman is hotly in favor of wholesale energy price caps in California and is cosponsor of a bill to impose them But he cautions that hed rather see FERC put them in place Bingaman is c autious about Bushs interest in easing regulations on power plants He has introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming The yearold Senator says hes going to try to sit with Republicans and work out some middle ground Hes already reportedly made some progress on renewables wind power and en ergy production tax credits Can we double energy efficiency by The Assn of Energy Engineers AEE favors a comprehensive energy technology strategy and the one they want could double the energy efficiency of build ings by slash carbon emissions in half and save billion a year said Albert Thumann the groups executive director You can see their energy policy at wwwaeecenterorg AEE asked its members whether the administrations national energy po licy would encourage new supply and said it should Then said environmental regulations shouldnt be eased to build new pla nts though While of the nonprofits members felt nuclear power should be encourag ed the report criticized the Bush plan for not promoting conservation and energy efficiency The White House energy plan cuts RD funding for energy efficiency technolo gies by million and relies heavily on oil and gas exploration and buil ding new power generation stations at the expense of the environment AEE s aid Tauzin pictures widespread blackouts Rep Billy Tauzin chairman of the Energy Commerce Committee dramatically warned EEI of a looming energy crisis larger than almost anyones envisione d so far The entire US may be in for Californiascale blackouts if natural gas produ ction isnt increased and new electric plants arent built fast The country is very close to the beginning of a national energy crisis th at endangers among other things the nations hightech infrastructure He echoed dire warnings sounded earlier by the administration saying that the country needs to new power plants just to stay even with a projected rise in electric demand over the next two decades Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said shes bullish on continued e nergy deregulation in the states despite Californias woes She called for new investment in renewable energy An advocate of nuclear power she expressed disappointment of incoming Democratic Senate leaders w ho oppose the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository Use DG as risk management tool XENERGY sees distributed generation as a growing risk management tool a sa fety net

in the hundreds of millions of dollars Montali deni ed a QF creditors committee motion for an immediate decision Avoiding cascading failure at TVA If the security grid coordinators around the country cant share informatio n about whats happening on the transmission networks congestion problems will worsen predicted Vikram Budhraja CEO of Electric Power Group One of the most seriously congested pathway in America last summer was disc overed running north to south through TVA Over transactions were cancelled from May to September last year and even more are expected this year If that load isnt controlled Budhraja warned the eastern interconnection is vulnerable to a cascading network failure Budhraja chairs CERTS Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solut ions and the group has just put the finishing touches on software that can track congestion on the TVA path and NERC will be installing it within the next few days The WSCC outage could have been prevented if information had been trad ed between control areas better he said Murkowski vows to fight electricity price caps policy It was Frank Murkowskis last day as chairman for now of the Energy Natural Resources Committee His final message as the chairman yesterday was that the minority Republica ns will not supports caps for electricity prices in California The Alaska Republican may now seem to fade into the background but for all we know control of the Senate may bounce back and forth as members come an d go during this session of Congress Republicans vowed Murkowski will fight any effort to include price contro ls in the comprehensive energy policy engendered by the president and now b eing hashed out in committee Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the incoming chairman will allow dozens of new am endments to come before the committee prompting Murkowski to call the Demo crats approach to an energy policy piecemeal Democrats dont plan to boost production For Murkowski thats a mistake made in the Energy Policy Act and an er ror in judgement about to be repeated Murkowski argued The elements pushing production were stricken from the law but mandati ng low flush toilets did get included the senator reminded Bushs energy plan had a lack of balance with not enough emphasis promot ing conservation energy efficiency and development of renewable wind sola r and geothermal energy sources Democrats charged Monday The majority members dont want to deal with the nuclear waste issue and th at kills any hope to spur new nuclear plant construction Murkowski groused Setting the tone for the new committee makeup the exchairman passionately argued against wholesale price caps claiming they nix new investment by se verely limiting return on investment If the controls are high enough l ike a maybe that would be acceptable but nothing as low as what t he Democrats want he said Now that the Bush FERC is in place Congress isnt needed to tinker with price controls he concluded The current energy bill is a good legacy for Chairman Bingaman to use in cr afting meaningful legislation Murkowski suggested Texas residents may be staying away from electric choice IOUs have signed up only about residentials so far while are eligible for the pilot Busine ss customers have flocked into the pilot totaling of an eligible Selling stable prices works for NewPower in California Yes the
