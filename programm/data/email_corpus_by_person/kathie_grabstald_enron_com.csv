supply transaction the first inside Germany by a nonincumbe nt player with EnBW at Steinitz to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q this year Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German y in order to close the gas supply deal Although we are happy that we ha ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac tual obligations it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net work operators while this was a transaction only within Germany the neg otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France commented Carsten H aack who closed this deal together with HelgeJuergen Beil Ulrich Finke a nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team Another important el ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran sportation contract for VNG Germanys largest German import company after Ruhrgas This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals especially in East Germany said Haack But more importantly this deal will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo mers it can deliver on its promises and of equal importance that network operators had better take our transportation requests seriously he added
