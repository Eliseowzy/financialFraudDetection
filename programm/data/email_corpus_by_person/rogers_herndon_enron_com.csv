<31296258.1075849735198.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rogers.herndon@enron.com,2001-01-18 08:55:00,Re TVA s Bid Cc Thanks for your response At this time EPMI is unable to accept TVAs bid Are the issues raised by TVA significant enough that if amended would allow TVA to provide EPMI with a bid equal to EPMIs original offer EPMI does plan to go forward with an offering to several market participants on Monday EPMI will include TVA in the process if you wish Rogers Herndon Goza Stuart L on PM To cc Creel Elizabeth A Subject TVA s Bid Rogers TVAs current bid is kwmonth for the term May through December Enron could call on units not being dispatched by TVA only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period If the AAF is equal to or less than for a month then the Demand Charge for that month will be zero instead of kwmonth Having the potential of hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low guaranteed availability during the nonsummer also reduces the value to TVA Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different product such as unit capacity with LD energy then that would increase the value to TVA A transaction of this duration is subject to TVA Board approval Please let me know if the bid is acceptable or if Enron want to offer a product with higher availability Thanks Stuart From SMTP Sent Tuesday January AM To Cc Subject RE Tolling Proposal Stuart The following is our response to question In situations where a unit is not available due to unexpected maintenance but the advanced notice time requirements for a Scheduled Outage hours have not yet been met or if the hours for that month have already been used for Scheduled Outages then EPMI could inform TVA that the unit is not available and TVA could not then call on the unit this would be D This prevents TVA from calling on and counting on a unit that is not available Note that EPMI would not get credit for availability during this period Note that this is considered a courtesy opportunity for the Buyer EPMI does not object to removing the term D EPMI request an indication of interest from TVA regarding the current proposal as soon as possible EPMIs current plan is to issue a bid package no later than Friday am Rogers Herndon Rogers CT To cc Subject Document link David Portz AM Stuart Thanks for the prompt response I am having someone address question and will forward as soon as possible Regarding EPMI is proposing a guaranteed heat rate and start up fuel quantities As long as TVA arranges for and delivers these fuel quantities EPMI will manage any actual imbalances However TVA would be responsible for all imbalances and potential penalties associated with underover deliveries vs the guaranteed quantities I hope this response is sufficient If not please let me know Rogers Herndon Goza Stuart L on AM To cc Subject RE Tolling Proposal Thanks for your response I have two initial commentsquestions I dont understand D in the formula shown in for AAF What is it how it is determined If D and M exclude MO SO and Force Majure what is left for D If TVA only has rights to of the units how would gas imbalance charges be handled if both TVA and Enron are supply gas for the total plant Certainly there will be situations were units trip or fail to start etc which will lead to imbalances From SMTP Sent Thursday January AM To Cc Subject Tolling Proposal Stuart Below are the responses to TVAs questions Please let me know if and how TVA would like to proceed from here EPMI remains interested in entering into a transaction with TVA However as mentioned EPMI is on track to release a bid proposal to several market participants early next week At this point EPMI targets a release date of Wednesday am Please contact me at to discuss how we proceed from here Thanks Rogers Herndon Forwarded by Rogers HerndonHOUECT on AM To Rogers ct cc Subject Tolling Proposal Forwarded by Rogers HerndonHOUECT on AM Goza Stuart L on AM To Goza Stuart L cc Subject RE EPMI Draft Proposal When do you anticipate a response to these questions We do have interest but this information is important I hope that you will delay sending your proposal out to others until we have a chance to fully evaluate your offer From Goza Stuart L Sent Monday January AM To Goza Stuart L Cc Subject RE EPMI Draft Proposal Answers to these questions will assist us in determining our position regarding your offer Certain of the following information is drawn from historical data as to the plant Nothing below is a representation as to the plants operability on a goingforward basis Why is the proposed guaranteed availability so low in the nonsummer months At the quoted monthly Demand Charge EPMI feels that the guaranteed availability values are competitive Please note that represents a guaranteed availability and actual availabilty will be targeted at a much higher level Major maintenance would be completed during the nonsummer months How do you propose that availability be calculated We propose that availability will be calculated using the following formula AAF PC D MPC where AAF Actual Availability Factor for a given month P the number of peak hours in a given month where peak hours are HE Sunday through Saturday ie days a week C the contracted quantity for that month in units of MWs D The number of unit hours declared by EPMI not available in the peak hours of that given month times the maximum Contracted Capacity of that unit M The number of MWhs called on by Buyer in the peak hours of that given month but not delivered by Seller for that month Note Both D and M would exclude the Major Maintenance Outages see below Scheduled Outages see below outages due to Force Majeure Buyers inability to perform including but not limited to nonavailability of gas andor gas transport and EPMIs inability to operate the plant due to legal regulatory or permitting restrictions or other reasons beyond the reasonable control of EPMI Major Maintenance Outages MO The Seller would be allowed days per year per unit to conduct major maintenance MOs would not count against the Actual Availability Factor see calculation below Seller may only schedule MOs with at least a day notice and only during the months of October November December March andor April Scheduled Outages SO The Seller would be allowed hrs per month per unit to conduct scheduled maintenance SOs would not count against the Actual Availability Factor see calculation below Seller will make commercially reasonable efforts to schedule SOs during nonpeak periods weekends and nights Seller may only schedule SOs with at least a hour notice Note that the Guaranteed Availability Factor GAF would be set at for the summer months and for the other months The contracted Full Demand Charge FDC for any given month would be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller as long as the Actual Availability Factor AAF is equal to or greater than the GAF or for that month For any month in which AAF falls below the GAF of or depending on the month the Purchaser TVA would pay the Seller EPMI a prorated amount of the FDC using the formula below This prorated amount is known as the Reduced Demand Charge RDC Notice that an AAF of or less for any given month would result in a floor Reduced Demand Charge of kwmo for that month ADC FDC GAF AAF as long as AAF is equal to or greater than and less than or equal to the GAF either or ADC kw for months in which AAF is equal to or less than ADC FDC for months in which AAF is equal to or greater than the GAF where ADC Actual Demand Charge for a given month FDC Full Demand Charge for a given month AAF Actual Availability Factor as defined below This number is given as a whole number eg is GAF Guaranteed Availability Factor All percentages are rounded to the next highest whole number eg becomes becomes Is the plant winterized that is can it run in the cold weather Significant upgrades were made to the plant after the calendar year to aid in winterization In general however even fully winterized plants tend to be less reliable in extremely cold weather It would be Buyers responsibility to address natural gas availability and delivery concerns throughout the year including winter months From a manpower standpoint is the plant available x for all months or are the certain periods of time when the plant is not staffed The plant is staffed or has members on ready recall x However in order to have full preparation time a hour notice is required prior to dispatch Dispatch outside MF peak hours X HE requires a hour dispatch notice What has been the historic availability of the plant by month Using the formula above the Actual Availability Factor AAF for the plant by month for calendar year is shown below Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Note that approximate average per unit run hours during calendar year was hours What type of gas transportation has been historically used interruptible or firm Historically EPMI has utilized both firm and interruptible gas transportation depending on availability Has the plant ever been unavailable due to the inability of fuel Only once since plant construction This occurred during a runtime with minimal advance notice In general fuel availability is the responsibility of the Buyer and is more readily available with greater advance notice Note also that the plant was only minimally run during the most recent winter season due to noneconomic dispatch conditions therefore the availability of gas this past winter was not tested EPMI is willing to discuss with Buyer making the facility a dual fuel plant subject to permitting restrictions and operational parameters and effected at Buyers expense Am I correct in assuming that in the tolling type arrangement TVA has exclusive use of the plant that is Enron would not have access to the output unless TVA specifically waives its rights EPMI would not have access to specific units of the plant while those units were being dispatched by TVA The plant has six units and four would be designated by unit number to TVA for purposes of the tolling agreement EPMI could call on units not being dispatched by TVA From SMTP Sent Thursday January PM To Goza Stuart L Cc Subject RE EPMI Draft Proposal Stuart Yes the hours are annual limits I apologize for the confusion EPMI is currently finalizing a bid solicitation for the New Albany tolling service We anticipate sending this proposal to interested parties by the middle of next week In the event EPMI and TVA have not entered into exclusive negotiations by the time of the bid offering EPMI would encourage TVA to join the bid process We anticipate this process lasting two weeks Please feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions Rogers Herndon

guaranty due to Enrons disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL EESI via Firemans Fund Insurance Company issued a Performance Bond in th e amount of in June the Performance Bond was reissued in J une in the amount of EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October addressed to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements and received by Becky probably October indicating that EESIs cu rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th e amount to to cover EESIs current activity level Becky d elivered the October th letter to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department Karen Cordova and informed Karen that EESI need ed to increase the Performance Bond to Karen requested Credit Department Nichole Gunter initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t o the level to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati on with Credit Department was October In telephone conversations with ISONE Enrons Credit Department personnel were informed by ISONE t hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r esolved within ten days of the date of the October letter Oc tober however the letter did not indicate such I was notified by Credit Department on October that the bond compa ny Enron utilizes for performance bonds would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin g invoices for other performance bonds bond renewals approximately The other performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI since June to various individuals ie Greg Sharp Mark Mueller J eff Golden Scott Mills and had still remained unpaid Payments for the other performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to which w as issued by the bond company on October executed by EESI on Octo ber and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISONE on October EESI was unable to comply with the October deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above Credit Department personnel informed ISONE pe rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October deadline but was wor king diligently to resolve the matter Credit Department personnel sent via FAX a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor mance Bond to ISONE personnel on October I notified Dan Allegretti Enron Government Affairs Chariman NEPOOL Par ticipants Committee of the entire situation prior to October Da n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems but to get t he matter resolved as quickly as possible Dan advised me that the implicat ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published the following month EESI would no longer be listed as being in default On O ctober another letter was sent to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements f rom Edward McKenna Vice President Chief Financial Officer informing EESI that Enron Energy Services Inc has not maintained the required level of financial assurance for days or more and has had a total combination o f financial assurance andor payment defaults in the last months whic h qualifies them as having two Level defaults The ISO has been in c ontact with Enron Energy Services Inc through multiple telephone communic ations and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured Th erefore per the established procedure we are forwarding this information to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them According to Da n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him as Chariman of the Members Subcommittee and he would discuss the issue with them The previ ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October letter occurred i December when payment was received days late and was automatically resolved when payment was received and ii September when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a ctivity To the best of my knowledge EESI was unaware of either the Decem ber Payment Default or the September Financial Assurance Default and no information was received by EESI from ISONE relative to either inc idence According to i Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce edings and ii conversations with Dan Allegretti the issue should be reso lved with the receipt on October of the Performance Bond by ISONE I have also advised the ISONE in the future to send communications to EESIs Credit Department and not EESIs Settlements Also Dan Allegretti is investigating the facts leading the the October letter with re presentatives from ISONE I left message for Molly Harris as you requested I was able to speak to De nise Furey and Nichole Gunter who both indicated that they would speak wit h Molly as they all work together Let me know if you need any additional information

Rogers Subject Rogers Enron Energy Services Inc EESI submitted application to become a NEPO OL member to be effective January EESI was approved by the NEPOO L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January meeting On e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po licy for NEPOOL Members EESI Enron Energy Marketing Corp and Enron Powe r Marketing Inc are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bonds rather than corporate guaranty due to Enrons disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL EESI via Firemans Fund Insurance Company issued a Performance Bond in th e amount of in June the Performance Bond was reissued in J une in the amount of EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October addressed to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements and received by Becky probably October indicating that EESIs cu rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th e amount to to cover EESIs current activity level Becky d elivered the October th letter to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department Karen Cordova and informed Karen that EESI need ed to increase the Performance Bond to Karen requested Credit Department Nichole Gunter initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t o the level to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati on with Credit Department was October In telephone conversations with ISONE Enrons Credit Department personnel were informed by ISONE t hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r esolved within ten days of the date of the October letter Oc tober however the letter did not indicate such I was notified by Credit Department on October that the bond compa ny Enron utilizes for performance bonds would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin g invoices for other performance bonds bond renewals approximately The other performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI since June to various individuals ie Greg Sharp Mark Mueller J eff Golden Scott Mills and had still remained unpaid Payments for the other performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to which w as issued by the bond company on October executed by EESI on Octo ber and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISONE on October EESI was unable to comply with the October deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above Credit Department personnel informed ISONE pe rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October deadline but was wor king diligently to resolve the matter Credit Department personnel sent via FAX a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor mance Bond to ISONE personnel on October I notified Dan Allegretti Enron Government Affairs Chariman NEPOOL Par ticipants Committee of the entire situation prior to October Da n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems but to get t he matter resolved as quickly as possible Dan advised me that the implicat ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published the following month EESI would no longer be listed as being in default On O ctober another letter was sent to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements f rom Edward McKenna Vice President Chief Financial Officer informing EESI that Enron Energy Services Inc has not maintained the required level of financial assurance for days or more and has had a total combination o f financial assurance andor payment defaults in the last months whic h qualifies them as having two Level defaults The ISO has been in c ontact with Enron Energy Services Inc through multiple telephone communic ations and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured Th erefore per the established procedure we are forwarding this information to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them According to Da n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him as Chariman of the Members Subcommittee and he would discuss the issue with them The previ ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October letter occurred i December when payment was received days late and was automatically resolved when payment was received and ii September when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a ctivity To the best of my knowledge EESI was unaware of either the Decem ber Payment Default or the September Financial Assurance Default and no information was received by EESI from ISONE relative to either inc idence According to i Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce edings and ii conversations with Dan Allegretti the issue should be reso lved with the receipt on October of the Performance Bond by ISONE I have also advised the ISONE in the future to send communications to EESIs Credit Department and not EESIs Settlements Also Dan Allegretti is investigating the facts leading the the October letter with re presentatives from ISONE I left message for Molly Harris as you requested I was able to speak to De nise Furey and Nichole Gunter who both indicated that they would speak wit h Molly as they all work together Let me know if you need any additional information Richard
