<24834129.1075860505966.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kevin.montagne@enron.com,2000-02-23 14:13:00,AGENCYCOM Presentation at BEA Users Conferenceis the information regarding the presentation done by AGENCYCOM The BEA Users Conference is being held in San Francisco CA The conference has over registered users representing many types of companies About the Session and Presentation On Wednesday February at an hour long session was to open to any registered conference attendee Around very rough guess people attended the session The session was moderated by Scott Dietzen CTO BEA Server Division and was described as Web ECommerce Solutions Using Best of Breed Technologies The session included panel members from Calico Commerce an ISV Idea Integration an integrator Cygent an ISV and AGENCYCOM Each of the panel members gave a minute presentation then the session was turned over for general questions and answers Joe Tatem of AGENCYCOM went last and spoke about the web development marketplace where it was and where it needed to head Like the other panel members he described his company and gave a little sales pitch for BEA Weblogic Tatem then presented a case study as an example of some of their work This example was of AGENCYCOMs work for Enron on EnronOnline His case study consisted of slides The first slide had screen images of EnronOnline one was the EnronOnline home page and the second was the quotes page populated with some products The quotes page was overlayed on the home page and obscured the EnronOnline banner on the bottom so that only the ne at the end showed The Enron logo the counterclockwise degree logo was clearly visible He talked about it being a Trading Extranet site but said he could not name the customer He described that real time prices for products were being displayed to customers He then showed the next slide which gave a high level overview of the application architecture for EnronOnline This slide contains details about real time server RTServer and its associated application server including the RMI communication mechanism He made a comment about how they were particularly proud of the real time piece and how it was designed and how it worked This slide also contained a reference to the fact EnronOnline uses Oracle i He also mentioned Jesica as the content management piece and indicated that they were looking at other rd party products to replace that in their future projects This slide also contains a reference to StackManager and he indicated that it was developed by the unamed client and not by AGENCYCOM He also talked about ShockWave plugin being used in the browser to receive the real time quotes Only one question was asked from the audience during his showing of the technical architecture slide This question paraphrased was When you use RMI between the web server and the app server how many connections do you use He replied paraphrased one per thread The questioner then asked something else that I assumed was a technical detail about how WebLogic RMI worked Tatem replied incorrectly and a BEA employee responded with the right answer About the Handouts of the Presentation BEA tried to make available hard copies of all presentation slides in each session They setup a series of shelves that were numbered for each session The documents were available starting Monday during the registration process and throughout the conference On Monday evening I went to pick up hard copies of the sessions for which I was interested About a third of the handouts for the sessions were not available I did not notice whether the one for above mentioned presentation was available I did not expect it to one of the more interested ones During some of the sessions BEA handed out copies to those present I did not see any handed out during the above mentioned session After the session was over I called Jay Webb and told him of the above details After telling Jay I saw Scott Dietzen from BEA in the hallway I had met him twice before I told Dietzen that the presentation that AGENCYCOM did in his panel was about Enron We had already discussed the project with Dietzen when he visited our Houston office I told him that AGENCYCOM was not supposed to reveal any information concerning the project At this time I did not know that hard copies of the presentation were available I told Dietzen that if they did become available that the portion about EnronOnline should not be distributed Dietzen said he was not aware of the problem with discussing the project He apologized and said he would not distribute any handouts if he received them Sometime later on Wednesday I went to the rack of presentation handouts and there was one available for the above mentioned session I do not know how long they were available and I dont think Dietzen did either There were only or copies left and I took all of them BEA usually put out many copies in the rack so I dont know how many were actually picked up The hard copies are PowerPoint printouts that include room for notes so the slides are very small making it difficult to read When the slides were shown on the screen during the session they were very clear Also during some of the sessions not the one where AGENCYCOM presented I attended there was some question about the availability of the handouts and someone from BEA would answer something about the web I assumed that at some point in the near future they might be making copies of the presentations available on the BEA web site I will try to confirm this tomorrow Thursday I checked the web site a few minutes ago and the presentations are not there I will followup with any more details if I remember something else or if there are any further developments Thanks Kevin Montagne Voice
