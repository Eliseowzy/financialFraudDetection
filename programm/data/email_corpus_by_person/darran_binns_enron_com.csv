For Jan Start For Deregulation Official Dow Jones Interactive October Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter Report Dow Jones Interactive October CPUC Approves Transmission Project Dow Jones Interactive October WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization Dow Jones Interactive October Calif seen facing next power crunch in May LOS ANGELES Oct Reuters California looks to have sufficient power supplies to get through the winter without blackouts with its next supply challenge likely to occur next May according to a report issued by the California Independent System Operator CAISO on Monday Based on currently available data with the possible exception of May the CAISO anticipates sufficient capacity margins throughout the winter season the agency which controls most of the states power grid said in its winter assessment report The report which covered October through May projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up Operating margins for May are slim with the current level of planned outages However the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month the report noted The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May can be avoided the report said An additional megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of During an additional MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May period the report said Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering In December for example a peak load of MW was projected versus an average of MW ISO figures show Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time the report said California hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market endured the years sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May The lights stayed on throughout the summer when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts Texas Ready For Jan Start For Deregulation Official CHICAGO Dow Jones Texas will be ready to implement fullscale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year despite challenges from critics the top official at the states powergrid operator said Monday We believe that weve come a long way said Tom Noel chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the states Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay A pilot program for of Texas investorowned utility customers has been in effect since late July and it started after a nearly twomonth delay linked to system glitches The consumer groups including AARP and Consumers Union the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers among other issues It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional the groups said in comments filed with the PSC But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan deadline So far of customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched and the others are moving through the planned day switching process he said There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August caused by system malfunctions but those have mostly been resolved he said Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November Noel said Noel also said Ercots settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state The markets working very well Noel said What we have is a data problem Ercots systems are designed to handle about customer switches a day So far the system has received and processed a peak volume of between and switches Noel said By Jon Kamp Dow Jones Newswires Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter Report LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California may be able to chill out a bit this winter New power plants and continued conservation should give the state enough of a margin to head off the soaring prices and rolling blackouts that plagued it a year ago according to a forecast released last week by the states power grid operator In general it looks like a pretty good forecast through the winter months into said Gregg Fishman spokesman for the California Independent System Operator Last winter California experienced an unprecedented electricity shortage that resulted in more than days of power emergencies and scattered rolling blackouts The situation was partly due to the deteriorating financial condition of the states two largest utilities high prices of natural gas and maintenance outages This winter however the state should have an adequate supply of electricity due in part to new generation coming online and a statewide conservation effort Powerplant maintenance will be minimal during the winter season compared with last year and new power plants operating since Sept will produce megawatts in new supply according to the ISO report The ISO charged with keeping power supply and demand in balance on the grid and operating the states spot electricity market expects demand for power to peak at megawatts in October and about megawatts from November through May That would leave operating reserves of between and megawatts roughly a reserve margin the minimum amount required by the Western Systems Coordinating Council which maintains grid reliability throughout the West The ISO said the reserve margin is enough to avert the disaster the state experienced last winter according to the report In addition the ISO expects there will be enough natural gas in storage to meet demand Last winter the price of natural gas skyrocketed to a million British thermal unit Currently the average price of natural gas is about MMBtu Naturalgas storage is looking very very strong Fishman said Theres far more in storage and available in general than we saw last year at this same time The ISO doesnt know whether generators have firm fuel contracts in place to cover demand But the grid operator doesnt expect limits on gas supplies to hurt its ability to keep the lights on according to the report The ISO forecast assumes Californians will continue to conserve about of their electrical consumption Fishman said The state also relies heavily on imports from the Pacific Northwest in order to get through without any power emergencies or rolling blackouts The state expects to import about MW this winter As a result the ISO forecast could change in the coming months if the state is unable to import power Currently the forecast for the Pacific Northwest calls for a wet winter in the Northwest according to the National Weather Service Jerry Rust president of the Northwest Power Pool told Dow Jones Newswires the region expects to cover peak demand this winter The agency is currently preparing its own report he added New generation upgrades in northern California will help minimize congestion on the transmission link known as Path the key northsouth interconnection although bottlenecks could still occur according to the report Depending on actual Pacific Northwest import levels and Northern California hydro levels potential overloads on Path could occur again this winter as a result of southtonorth power transfers according to the report Some areas of northern California particularly Humboldt County and the Bay Area could encounter some difficulties if local generation isnt available due to power plant maintenance or breakdowns For the ISO said there are new power plant projects totaling megawatts that are in different phases of hooking up to the grid but its unclear how much of that capacity will be added before May according to the report CPUC Approves Transmission Project SAN FRANCISCO California The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC last week approved a transmission project to increase capacity to several cities in the San Francisco metropolitan area that will be built by Pacific Gas Electric PGE The kilovolt transmission line would serve the cities of Dublin Pleasanton Livermore San Ramon and unincorporated areas of Alameda and Contra Costa counties The CPUC placed a cap of million on the project costs for the mile line As a condition for approval the CPUC also required PGE to remove an existing kilovolt line WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization TUCSON ArizBUSINESS WIREOct A broad group of electric transmission line owners in the Southwest has taken initial steps to form WestConnect a forprofit regional transmission organization RTO Founding members believe WestConnect will form the framework for an RTO for the entire Western United States Agreements and operating protocols for the RTO were filed today with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC by Arizona Public Service Co El Paso Electric Co Public Service Co of New Mexico and Tucson Electric Power Co each of which is subject to FERC oversight These utilities along with Salt River Project in Arizona have agreed to fund startup of WestConnect operations which are projected to begin in Other utilities in the Desert Southwest and adjoining areas have been actively involved in the process and are expected to continue to be involved as WestConnect gets underway FERC has proposed RTOs to facilitate development and operation of transmission on a regional basis WestConnect will strengthen reliability for customers and ease the transfer of electricity between regions It will do so by focusing on transmission line reliability nondiscriminatory open access to use of the lines support for a robust wholesale market and governance that is independent of market participants WestConnect evolved from an earlier Southwestern RTO development project named DesertSTAR and it has used the operating protocols developed by DesertSTAR stakeholders through extensive negotiations during the last four years DesertSTAR Chairman of the Board Jack King said WestConnect is a logical step I am encouraged by the actions of the WestConnect members in building upon the work of DesertSTAR to move toward an RTO for the West The group turned to the forprofit governance structure in lieu of the notforprofit DesertSTAR model in response to recent FERC rulings and a desire to create a governance structure that will encourage innovation and creativity in the operation and further development of the Western transmission grid WestConnect has been structured to permit involvement by investorowned utilities cooperatives publicpower entities and federal power marketing agencies so it can transition into the RTO for the West WestConnect is working closely with other utility companies and provisional RTO projects to explore expanding WestConnects service area WestConnect utilities say they are confident their filing with FERC conforms to the regulatory agencys established organizational and operating guidelines

of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers Dow Jones Interactive October Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter Dow Jones Interactive October FERC extends price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON Oct Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April for the price cap which first went into effect in July of last year However FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time Therefore FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running We believe that our decision will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets which will increase supply improve reliability and lower energy prices the agency said in its order The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions The price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices The cap is supported by several large utilities such as Consolidated Edison Inc which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers However some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers USING scare and bully tactics the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid The efficient stable economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York Marylands carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years Challenges by Maryland Virginia and Washington to the federal agencys mandate have been ignored So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire Curiously FERC cited the PJM network which includes Maryland as a model for the nation Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems Warning of California type energy problems for the rest of the nation FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better It ignores the fact that California is the largest US electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them Even within PJM which serves five states and Washington members hold differing positions on forming megaregional networks But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its million customers well Theres little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of a megawatthour the agency said Wednesday The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov Gray Davis the department said In a press release the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division its powermarketing arm said it resold megawatthours or of its total purchases That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts not the longterm contracts the department said Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways the department said The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts or about onethird of the total According to the DWR power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply Shortterm deals such as monthly or quarterly contracts represent onethird of the portfolio The rest is bought in the spot market The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and cents per kilowatthour for the next five years Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices Similarly the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position the department said The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric

to be taken over by state Dow Jones Interactive October Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation Dow Jones Interactive October FERC to give states a role in RTO formation Dow Jones Interactive October State loses million in power plays ploys It sold some energy for loss gave some away Sacramento California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least million in power trading losses The state Department of Water Resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold megawatt hours of electricity during the threemonth period ending in June That represents about percent of the total traded during that period Included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all On May the state sold megawatt hours of power for cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The state paid an average of a megawatt hour during May Two days later the state gave away megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility We may not have had a buyer said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Its not a storable product Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesnt need it Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March when million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about minutes Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fastchanging the electricity supplyanddemand situation was during the height of the energy crisis State officials say it is normal for any energybuying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally Turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly powerbuying costs But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at abovemarket rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business I suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the Department of Water Resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen Two propositions on SF ballot If San Francisco voters decide Nov that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than PGE it will be some time before the switch is flipped Propositions F and I which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures There is also uncertainty about the costs Neither measure has a price tag attached For more than two decades in San Francisco PGE has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voterbacked initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system The move gained steam with the state energy crisis If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov they will join more than public jurisdictions including Sacramento Los Angeles and Seattle that provide electric power to about million customers accounting for percent of the demand in the United States Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district or MUD in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors Measurebackers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district The directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PGE and the San Franciscoowned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency The other measure Proposition F would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the mayorappointed Public Utilities Commission The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses Like the MUD called for in Proposition I the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power Then with the consent of the Board of Supervisors the agency could take over PGEs electricity system No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under million without approval by supervisors or voters Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum The Prop F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy Props F and I both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power If both measures pass Prop I will take priority Supervisors placed Prop F on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PGE The utility waged a year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento and eventually lost Opponents of the SF public power effort with PGE at the lead already have spent more than on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks ATT and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco as well Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PGEs distribution system at million Other estimates have ranged from million to billion A lot of people are not happy with PGE But neither of these measures can guarantee that theyre going to solve the states power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said Jim Mathias vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce The unknown could be worse Proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders Historically such public power systems have had lower rates The only unknowns are ephemeral because weve seen through the Sacramento MUD the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power advocate THE MUD MEASURES San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov ballot PROPOSITION F Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors the measure would Abolish San Franciscos Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system which is now operated by the city PUC Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Cos control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses It also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local PUC has Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters Any bond issue of more than million would be subject to referendum Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall For example the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PGEs distribution lines and generation facilities PROPOSITION I Placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane The district would be run by an elected fivemember board of directors Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov ballot Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PGEs electrical and distribution system in San Francisco as well as the Hetch Hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers Requires a feasibility study of such an action Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts Give the MUD power as a state agency independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds Power plant assessment to be taken over by state Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year The delay until Jan is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan Under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg which has been fighting the plan The city which has two new power plants expected million in property tax revenue With the changes that will be reduced to just said John Knox an attorney hired by the city Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community Youll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board There will be an even bigger energy crisis He said the move will have a devastating effect on the citys redevelopment agency Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation CALGARY Dow Jones The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a twoyear moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coalfired generation plants Loosening Ontario Power Generations hold on the bulk of the provinces power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May after three delays in as many years Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives said John Dalton director at Navigant Consulting Inc in Toronto The utility has five coalfired power plants including the megawatt Naticoke and MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels Right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we dont have a power market we have a regulatory scheme Dalton said Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its antipollution regulations The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuelburning generation stations starting Jan and will be fully implemented by Under the governments plan for deregulation OPG must sell or lease about MW of nonnuclear power within months of market opening The utility owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market OPG spokesman John Earl said This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring Were working on being ready for March an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down Thats what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPGs aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesnt make them that attractive to buyers Dalton said Lakeview operates about of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleanerburning natural gas plants Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates FERC to give states a role in RTO formation WASHINGTON Oct Reuters US federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees the countrys power grid operators has ordered utilities in the Southeast Northeast Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations RTOs by the end of the year The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rulemaking process STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies Citing states confusion about FERCs direction and inconsistent internal agency communication Brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation The request was made by David Svanda commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERCs workshop on RTOs last week The move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to cogovern the process with them FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting Wood previously headed Texas state utility regulatory agency Of state commissions Wood said they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table not just standing at the door taking tickets COSTBENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED FERC also promised to prepare a formal costbenefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits The agency did not say when the study would be completed On Tuesday the New York Independent System Operator ISO released its own costbenefit study which asserted the creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer power bills by some million a year The nonprofit New York ISO would also be put out of business by a regional forprofit RTO However a separate study issued last month by energy firm Mirant Corp a supporter of RTOs concluded that a Northeastern RTO would save consumers million annually At the meeting FERC commissioners heard staff presentations on RTO development progress in the Southeast Northeast and Midwest But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC will take in guiding utilities Wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on Nov just a month ahead of FERCs Dec deadline for RTO membership Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers

that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win Colen who lives in the West Portal area voted against two measures on the Nov ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PGEs monopoly in the local energy market The company and other corporate interests spent more than million to defeat the effort Colens vote reflected the sentiment throughout the citys conservative strongholds among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff In those neighborhoods Proposition F and Measure I lost almost to In the citys more liberal neighborhoods HaightAshbury Bernal Heights South of Market and Noe Valley the reverse was true And in the Mission support for public power was almost to Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power booster Once we engaged people talked to them they were very responsive I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again For Colen an environmental geologist and consultant the proposals were poorly drafted more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PGE than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably as backers of the measures promised San Francisco can get into the energy business said Colen But it should be incremental with a sound policy and with people in charge who are experts In addition he doesnt want an elected board running the operation as both Measure I and Proposition F required and he wants the city to explore working with PGE instead of ousting the private utility competely Then Colen said he may support public power Proposition F called for replacing the citys existing water and power department with a new expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers It lost by votes or less than percentage point Measure I the more farreaching of the two lost by votes or percentage points It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane It made a target of PGE but also had the power to take over the garbage cable and phone operations Despite the loss supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval At the same time they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year Bob Lipman a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system It was a blank check he said He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down Supervisor Tony Hall the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy People want to know how much this is going to cost Hall said Ammiano the author of Proposition F said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs generation capabilities financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests business owners and property owners backing the idea Ammiano said Another factor he said is voter turnout If we had percent higher turnout we probably would have won Ammiano said For example several neighborhoods among them the Western Addition Civic Center and the South of Market had turnout lower than the citywide average which was just less than percent Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters not putting efforts into wooing conservatives I truly believe I dont have to change peoples minds said Daly who favors local control of the electrical system I represent the majority opinion But the majority doesnt necessarily come out to vote Thats what we have to work on PGE CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ PGE crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas Electric in bankruptcy court The substation cleanup should be completed by midDecember at a cost of said PGE spokesman Jason Alderman Cleaning up Tom Billeccis and Vince Aiellos properties will cost about Once the substation site is free of contaminants the utility will sell the property to a developer who plans to build apartments The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property Alderman said The reason its expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done he said The utility operated a substation at the site from to The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PGE about the cleanup for a year They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer asthma and skin disorders The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup PGE will clean the area around a shed on Billeccis property something it had not planned to do before Billecci said he is pleased that PGE agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates when deregulation begins Residential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about percent Thats according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission Under the new socalled pricetobeat rate which still needs PUC approval someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save over the course of a year while someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save annually The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed This years increase though was rescinded as gas prices came down The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan when Texas opens its electricity market to competition is known as the price to beat Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors which in turn are expected to offer lower rates Other incumbent electric companies including Dallasbased TXU Energy will charge their own pricetobeat rates in their service territories The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices To set the price to beat the PUC uses complex formulas Costs are sorted into several categories including a base rate as well as costs tied to the price of natural gas which affects the price of electricity Under the deregulation law consumers automatically get a percent cut in the base portion starting Jan which depending on usage can make up percent of a consumers costs The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the socalled fuelfactor portion of the price to beat The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company The threemember commission still must give its approval which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec meeting The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses kilowatthours of electricity in a year or an average of a month is cents per kilowatthour Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday the cost would be cents per kilowatthour Thats a drop of percent Those per kilowatthour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher Reliant charges different rates for summer and non summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins The per kilowatthour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized average rates All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an applestoapples way to compare them Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the baserate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose percent of their customers The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs Earlier this week consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC if adopted could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers That option which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed isnt included in Reliants filing A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea and its unknown whether the PUC will ever take an upordown vote Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be In a filing Thursday with the PUC the New Power Co which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program New Power said New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition but like everyone else we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds it said

companies SF Gate News November India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week Dow Jones Interactive November Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation Dow Jones Interactive November Governors greased lighting Davis criticized for accepting money from power companies Sacramento After having sworn off campaign contributions from energy companies Gov Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state The two contributions came during a series of fundraisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon The Democratic governor who has raised more than million for his re election campaign has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration Yesterday Davis defended the decision to take the money saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned If it was dirty money before it is even dirtier now said Rosenfield who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over Rosenfield said Tell that to the million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of percent he said The two companies FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC each gave to Davis campaign fund Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California Caithness Energy a New Yorkbased generator is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month The company wants to build a megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County And subsidiaries of FPL Energy a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country are in negotiations with the states new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them In addition Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County That project was approved by the states Energy Commission in March Garry South Davis political adviser said the campaigns position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state he said South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week NEW DELHI Dow Jones Prospective buyers of the foreign equity in Indias megawatt Dabhol Power Co will start due diligence of the project next week AK Doda executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India PIDB told Dow Jones Newswires Friday The possible buyers are Tata Power Co Ltd PTPW and BSES Ltd PBSX After the due diligence is completed price negotiations will start and thereafter the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place Doda said US energy company Enron Corp ENE has a controlling equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plants sole customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the Indian federal governments failure to honor payment guarantees In August the US company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost Dabhol is Indias largest single foreign investment to date MSEB has while USbased companies General Electric Co GE and Bechtel XBTL own each in DPC The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties through mutual negotiations Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest Doda said Doda denied local media reports saying that Indias stateowned firm National Thermal Power Corp PNTP was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol So far I am aware of only two companies Tata Power and BSES NTPC havent sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project he said Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation The planned deregulation of the billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinces electricity transmission company preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market The plan known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders would turn Hydro One into a notforprofit entity instead of a fully commercial privatized company If this happens Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continents premier transmission companies a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe David Lindsay the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp the governments privatization adviser confirmed that turning Hydro One into a notforprofit organization similar to Nav Canada the civil air navigation service is under serious consideration Weve been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro Ones future including this one he said yesterday He would not provide details though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro Ones future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year A senior official in the Ontario government who did not want to be identified said the proposal is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro He was referring to the debtladen utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation the electricity generating arm and Hydro One whose network of highvoltage transmission lines spans kilometres The Premiers office would not comment A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that there are a number of options on the table Sources on Bay Street and at Queens Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a notforprofit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell the chairman of Royal Bankowned RBC Dominion Securities Bay Streets largest dealer If the new Hydro One took this shape it would raise about billion through the sale of bonds to investors The dealers commission on the sale of the bonds which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history would range from million to million one Bay Street executive said Mr Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the billion in stranded debt racked up by the old Ontario Hydro The generating and transmission giants decadeslong spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the provinces balance sheet Hydro Ones cash flow derived from sales to electricity users would be used to pay the interest on the billion of bonds Presumably consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest If Hydro One were a private company instead its financial risk would be borne by shareholders not ratepayers The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan citing client confidentiality concerns Mr Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices by next spring The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One both of which are per cent owned by the government into commercial companies In Hydro Ones case the leading options were thought to be an outright sale in which the utility would be bought by another company presumably a rival utility or an initial public offering where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange The third option converting Hydro One into a notforprofit organization has come as a surprise There has been no debate on this option though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the notforprofit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business The notforprofit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes which raises potential trade issues with the United States American transmission companies might argue that Hydro Ones nontaxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options Rod Taylor Hydro Ones executive vicepresident would not comment on the notforprofit option being contemplated by the government He said however that the companys strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector he said in a phone interview Stanley Hartt the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Streets Salomon Smith Barney is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a notforprofit structure for Hydro One Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro Ones strategic business plan In a threepage letter sent this week to the top executives of several large powerusing Ontario companies he said that this idea is shortsighted and bad for Ontario He argued that the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the notforprofit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers He also said that without financial flexibility Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in new bottleneckeliminating connections that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission he said In a recent report on the power industry TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States where ownership tends to be fragmented He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years and he said the utility has the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive highgrowth initiatives According to sources familiar with the notforprofit proposal Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users such as auto and steel makers and paper companies Such a structure exists at Nav Canada with airline executives on the board and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers Restructuring Hydro One with debt rather than equity is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company The problem with a Canadian National Railstyle IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt said one financier familiar with the proposal With a debtbased structure every dollar earned is available to pay interest while an equitybased structure means you pay federal taxes provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments Dofasco Inc the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about million of electricity a year supports the notforprofit proposal Gord Forstner head of communications said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydros stranded debt by billion immediately paving the way for lower electricity charges Currently a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt The charge costs Dofasco alone about million a year We want to see the stranded debt paid down first Mr Forstner said Until that happens we dont favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontarios boundaries Hydro One at a glance Ontarios electricity transmission system split off from the former Ontario Hydro in May It is the largest power distribution network in Canada and serves million people Revenues billion in billion through first nine months of Total assets billion including kilometres of wire stations and substations and connection facilities to New York Michigan

of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers Dow Jones Interactive October Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter Dow Jones Interactive October FERC extends price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON Oct Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April for the price cap which first went into effect in July of last year However FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time Therefore FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running We believe that our decision will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets which will increase supply improve reliability and lower energy prices the agency said in its order The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions The price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices The cap is supported by several large utilities such as Consolidated Edison Inc which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers However some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers USING scare and bully tactics the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid The efficient stable economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York Marylands carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years Challenges by Maryland Virginia and Washington to the federal agencys mandate have been ignored So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire Curiously FERC cited the PJM network which includes Maryland as a model for the nation Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems Warning of California type energy problems for the rest of the nation FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better It ignores the fact that California is the largest US electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them Even within PJM which serves five states and Washington members hold differing positions on forming megaregional networks But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its million customers well Theres little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of a megawatthour the agency said Wednesday The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov Gray Davis the department said In a press release the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division its powermarketing arm said it resold megawatthours or of its total purchases That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts not the longterm contracts the department said Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways the department said The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts or about onethird of the total According to the DWR power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply Shortterm deals such as monthly or quarterly contracts represent onethird of the portfolio The rest is bought in the spot market The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and cents per kilowatthour for the next five years Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices Similarly the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position the department said The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric

Interactive October State loses million in power plays ploys It sold some energy for loss gave some away Sacramento California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least million in power trading losses The state Department of Water Resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold megawatt hours of electricity during the threemonth period ending in June That represents about percent of the total traded during that period Included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all On May the state sold megawatt hours of power for cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The state paid an average of a megawatt hour during May Two days later the state gave away megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility We may not have had a buyer said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Its not a storable product Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesnt need it Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March when million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about minutes Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fastchanging the electricity supplyanddemand situation was during the height of the energy crisis State officials say it is normal for any energybuying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally Turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly powerbuying costs But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at abovemarket rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business I suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the Department of Water Resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen Two propositions on SF ballot If San Francisco voters decide Nov that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than PGE it will be some time before the switch is flipped Propositions F and I which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures There is also uncertainty about the costs Neither measure has a price tag attached For more than two decades in San Francisco PGE has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voterbacked initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system The move gained steam with the state energy crisis If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov they will join more than public jurisdictions including Sacramento Los Angeles and Seattle that provide electric power to about million customers accounting for percent of the demand in the United States Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district or MUD in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors Measurebackers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district The directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PGE and the San Franciscoowned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency The other measure Proposition F would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the mayorappointed Public Utilities Commission The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses Like the MUD called for in Proposition I the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power Then with the consent of the Board of Supervisors the agency could take over PGEs electricity system No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under million without approval by supervisors or voters Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum The Prop F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy Props F and I both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power If both measures pass Prop I will take priority Supervisors placed Prop F on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PGE The utility waged a year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento and eventually lost Opponents of the SF public power effort with PGE at the lead already have spent more than on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks ATT and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco as well Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PGEs distribution system at million Other estimates have ranged from million to billion A lot of people are not happy with PGE But neither of these measures can guarantee that theyre going to solve the states power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said Jim Mathias vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce The unknown could be worse Proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders Historically such public power systems have had lower rates The only unknowns are ephemeral because weve seen through the Sacramento MUD the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power advocate THE MUD MEASURES San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov ballot PROPOSITION F Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors the measure would Abolish San Franciscos Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system which is now operated by the city PUC Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Cos control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses It also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local PUC has Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters Any bond issue of more than million would be subject to referendum Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall For example the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PGEs distribution lines and generation facilities PROPOSITION I Placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane The district would be run by an elected fivemember board of directors Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov ballot Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PGEs electrical and distribution system in San Francisco as well as the Hetch Hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers Requires a feasibility study of such an action Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts Give the MUD power as a state agency independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds Power plant assessment to be taken over by state Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year The delay until Jan is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan Under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg which has been fighting the plan The city which has two new power plants expected million in property tax revenue With the changes that will be reduced to just said John Knox an attorney hired by the city Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community Youll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board There will be an even bigger energy crisis He said the move will have a devastating effect on the citys redevelopment agency Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation CALGARY Dow Jones The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a twoyear moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coalfired generation plants Loosening Ontario Power Generations hold on the bulk of the provinces power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May after three delays in as many years Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives said John Dalton director at Navigant Consulting Inc in Toronto The utility has five coalfired power plants including the megawatt Naticoke and MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels Right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we dont have a power market we have a regulatory scheme Dalton said Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its antipollution regulations The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuelburning generation stations starting Jan and will be fully implemented by Under the governments plan for deregulation OPG must sell or lease about MW of nonnuclear power within months of market opening The utility owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market OPG spokesman John Earl said This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring Were working on being ready for March an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down Thats what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPGs aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesnt make them that attractive to buyers Dalton said Lakeview operates about of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleanerburning natural gas plants Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates FERC to give states a role in RTO formation WASHINGTON Oct Reuters US federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees the countrys power grid operators has ordered utilities in the Southeast Northeast Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations RTOs by the end of the year The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rulemaking process STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies Citing states confusion about FERCs direction and inconsistent internal agency communication Brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation The request was made by David Svanda commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERCs workshop on RTOs last week The move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to cogovern the process with them FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting Wood previously headed Texas state utility regulatory agency Of state commissions

that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win Colen who lives in the West Portal area voted against two measures on the Nov ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PGEs monopoly in the local energy market The company and other corporate interests spent more than million to defeat the effort Colens vote reflected the sentiment throughout the citys conservative strongholds among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff In those neighborhoods Proposition F and Measure I lost almost to In the citys more liberal neighborhoods HaightAshbury Bernal Heights South of Market and Noe Valley the reverse was true And in the Mission support for public power was almost to Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power booster Once we engaged people talked to them they were very responsive I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again For Colen an environmental geologist and consultant the proposals were poorly drafted more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PGE than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably as backers of the measures promised San Francisco can get into the energy business said Colen But it should be incremental with a sound policy and with people in charge who are experts In addition he doesnt want an elected board running the operation as both Measure I and Proposition F required and he wants the city to explore working with PGE instead of ousting the private utility competely Then Colen said he may support public power Proposition F called for replacing the citys existing water and power department with a new expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers It lost by votes or less than percentage point Measure I the more farreaching of the two lost by votes or percentage points It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane It made a target of PGE but also had the power to take over the garbage cable and phone operations Despite the loss supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval At the same time they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year Bob Lipman a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system It was a blank check he said He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down Supervisor Tony Hall the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy People want to know how much this is going to cost Hall said Ammiano the author of Proposition F said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs generation capabilities financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests business owners and property owners backing the idea Ammiano said Another factor he said is voter turnout If we had percent higher turnout we probably would have won Ammiano said For example several neighborhoods among them the Western Addition Civic Center and the South of Market had turnout lower than the citywide average which was just less than percent Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters not putting efforts into wooing conservatives I truly believe I dont have to change peoples minds said Daly who favors local control of the electrical system I represent the majority opinion But the majority doesnt necessarily come out to vote Thats what we have to work on PGE CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ PGE crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas Electric in bankruptcy court The substation cleanup should be completed by midDecember at a cost of said PGE spokesman Jason Alderman Cleaning up Tom Billeccis and Vince Aiellos properties will cost about Once the substation site is free of contaminants the utility will sell the property to a developer who plans to build apartments The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property Alderman said The reason its expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done he said The utility operated a substation at the site from to The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PGE about the cleanup for a year They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer asthma and skin disorders The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup PGE will clean the area around a shed on Billeccis property something it had not planned to do before Billecci said he is pleased that PGE agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates when deregulation begins Residential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about percent Thats according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission Under the new socalled pricetobeat rate which still needs PUC approval someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save over the course of a year while someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save annually The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed This years increase though was rescinded as gas prices came down The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan when Texas opens its electricity market to competition is known as the price to beat Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors which in turn are expected to offer lower rates Other incumbent electric companies including Dallasbased TXU Energy will charge their own pricetobeat rates in their service territories The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices To set the price to beat the PUC uses complex formulas Costs are sorted into several categories including a base rate as well as costs tied to the price of natural gas which affects the price of electricity Under the deregulation law consumers automatically get a percent cut in the base portion starting Jan which depending on usage can make up percent of a consumers costs The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the socalled fuelfactor portion of the price to beat The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company The threemember commission still must give its approval which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec meeting The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses kilowatthours of electricity in a year or an average of a month is cents per kilowatthour Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday the cost would be cents per kilowatthour Thats a drop of percent Those per kilowatthour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher Reliant charges different rates for summer and non summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins The per kilowatthour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized average rates All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an applestoapples way to compare them Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the baserate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose percent of their customers The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs Earlier this week consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC if adopted could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers That option which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed isnt included in Reliants filing A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea and its unknown whether the PUC will ever take an upordown vote Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be In a filing Thursday with the PUC the New Power Co which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program New Power said New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition but like everyone else we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds it said

to be taken over by state Dow Jones Interactive October Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation Dow Jones Interactive October FERC to give states a role in RTO formation Dow Jones Interactive October State loses million in power plays ploys It sold some energy for loss gave some away Sacramento California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least million in power trading losses The state Department of Water Resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold megawatt hours of electricity during the threemonth period ending in June That represents about percent of the total traded during that period Included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all On May the state sold megawatt hours of power for cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The state paid an average of a megawatt hour during May Two days later the state gave away megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility We may not have had a buyer said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Its not a storable product Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesnt need it Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March when million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about minutes Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fastchanging the electricity supplyanddemand situation was during the height of the energy crisis State officials say it is normal for any energybuying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally Turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly powerbuying costs But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at abovemarket rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business I suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the Department of Water Resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen Two propositions on SF ballot If San Francisco voters decide Nov that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than PGE it will be some time before the switch is flipped Propositions F and I which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures There is also uncertainty about the costs Neither measure has a price tag attached For more than two decades in San Francisco PGE has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voterbacked initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system The move gained steam with the state energy crisis If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov they will join more than public jurisdictions including Sacramento Los Angeles and Seattle that provide electric power to about million customers accounting for percent of the demand in the United States Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district or MUD in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors Measurebackers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district The directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PGE and the San Franciscoowned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency The other measure Proposition F would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the mayorappointed Public Utilities Commission The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses Like the MUD called for in Proposition I the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power Then with the consent of the Board of Supervisors the agency could take over PGEs electricity system No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under million without approval by supervisors or voters Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum The Prop F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy Props F and I both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power If both measures pass Prop I will take priority Supervisors placed Prop F on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PGE The utility waged a year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento and eventually lost Opponents of the SF public power effort with PGE at the lead already have spent more than on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks ATT and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco as well Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PGEs distribution system at million Other estimates have ranged from million to billion A lot of people are not happy with PGE But neither of these measures can guarantee that theyre going to solve the states power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said Jim Mathias vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce The unknown could be worse Proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders Historically such public power systems have had lower rates The only unknowns are ephemeral because weve seen through the Sacramento MUD the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power advocate THE MUD MEASURES San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov ballot PROPOSITION F Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors the measure would Abolish San Franciscos Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system which is now operated by the city PUC Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Cos control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses It also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local PUC has Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters Any bond issue of more than million would be subject to referendum Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall For example the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PGEs distribution lines and generation facilities PROPOSITION I Placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane The district would be run by an elected fivemember board of directors Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov ballot Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PGEs electrical and distribution system in San Francisco as well as the Hetch Hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers Requires a feasibility study of such an action Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts Give the MUD power as a state agency independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds Power plant assessment to be taken over by state Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year The delay until Jan is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan Under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg which has been fighting the plan The city which has two new power plants expected million in property tax revenue With the changes that will be reduced to just said John Knox an attorney hired by the city Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community Youll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board There will be an even bigger energy crisis He said the move will have a devastating effect on the citys redevelopment agency Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation CALGARY Dow Jones The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a twoyear moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coalfired generation plants Loosening Ontario Power Generations hold on the bulk of the provinces power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May after three delays in as many years Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives said John Dalton director at Navigant Consulting Inc in Toronto The utility has five coalfired power plants including the megawatt Naticoke and MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels Right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we dont have a power market we have a regulatory scheme Dalton said Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its antipollution regulations The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuelburning generation stations starting Jan and will be fully implemented by Under the governments plan for deregulation OPG must sell or lease about MW of nonnuclear power within months of market opening The utility owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market OPG spokesman John Earl said This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring Were working on being ready for March an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down Thats what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPGs aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesnt make them that attractive to buyers Dalton said Lakeview operates about of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleanerburning natural gas plants Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates FERC to give states a role in RTO formation WASHINGTON Oct Reuters US federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees the countrys power grid operators has ordered utilities in the Southeast Northeast Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations RTOs by the end of the year The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rulemaking process STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies Citing states confusion about FERCs direction and inconsistent internal agency communication Brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation The request was made by David Svanda commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERCs workshop on RTOs last week The move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to cogovern the process with them FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting Wood previously headed Texas state utility regulatory agency Of state commissions Wood said they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table not just standing at the door taking tickets COSTBENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED FERC also promised to prepare a formal costbenefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits The agency did not say when the study would be completed On Tuesday the New York

of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers Dow Jones Interactive October Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter Dow Jones Interactive October FERC extends price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON Oct Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April for the price cap which first went into effect in July of last year However FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time Therefore FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running We believe that our decision will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets which will increase supply improve reliability and lower energy prices the agency said in its order The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions The price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices The cap is supported by several large utilities such as Consolidated Edison Inc which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers However some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers USING scare and bully tactics the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid The efficient stable economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York Marylands carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years Challenges by Maryland Virginia and Washington to the federal agencys mandate have been ignored So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire Curiously FERC cited the PJM network which includes Maryland as a model for the nation Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems Warning of California type energy problems for the rest of the nation FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better It ignores the fact that California is the largest US electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them Even within PJM which serves five states and Washington members hold differing positions on forming megaregional networks But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its million customers well Theres little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of a megawatthour the agency said Wednesday The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov Gray Davis the department said In a press release the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division its powermarketing arm said it resold megawatthours or of its total purchases That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts not the longterm contracts the department said Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways the department said The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts or about onethird of the total According to the DWR power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply Shortterm deals such as monthly or quarterly contracts represent onethird of the portfolio The rest is bought in the spot market The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and cents per kilowatthour for the next five years Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices Similarly the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position the department said The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric

that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win Colen who lives in the West Portal area voted against two measures on the Nov ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PGEs monopoly in the local energy market The company and other corporate interests spent more than million to defeat the effort Colens vote reflected the sentiment throughout the citys conservative strongholds among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff In those neighborhoods Proposition F and Measure I lost almost to In the citys more liberal neighborhoods HaightAshbury Bernal Heights South of Market and Noe Valley the reverse was true And in the Mission support for public power was almost to Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power booster Once we engaged people talked to them they were very responsive I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again For Colen an environmental geologist and consultant the proposals were poorly drafted more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PGE than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably as backers of the measures promised San Francisco can get into the energy business said Colen But it should be incremental with a sound policy and with people in charge who are experts In addition he doesnt want an elected board running the operation as both Measure I and Proposition F required and he wants the city to explore working with PGE instead of ousting the private utility competely Then Colen said he may support public power Proposition F called for replacing the citys existing water and power department with a new expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers It lost by votes or less than percentage point Measure I the more farreaching of the two lost by votes or percentage points It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane It made a target of PGE but also had the power to take over the garbage cable and phone operations Despite the loss supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval At the same time they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year Bob Lipman a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system It was a blank check he said He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down Supervisor Tony Hall the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy People want to know how much this is going to cost Hall said Ammiano the author of Proposition F said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs generation capabilities financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests business owners and property owners backing the idea Ammiano said Another factor he said is voter turnout If we had percent higher turnout we probably would have won Ammiano said For example several neighborhoods among them the Western Addition Civic Center and the South of Market had turnout lower than the citywide average which was just less than percent Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters not putting efforts into wooing conservatives I truly believe I dont have to change peoples minds said Daly who favors local control of the electrical system I represent the majority opinion But the majority doesnt necessarily come out to vote Thats what we have to work on PGE CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ PGE crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas Electric in bankruptcy court The substation cleanup should be completed by midDecember at a cost of said PGE spokesman Jason Alderman Cleaning up Tom Billeccis and Vince Aiellos properties will cost about Once the substation site is free of contaminants the utility will sell the property to a developer who plans to build apartments The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property Alderman said The reason its expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done he said The utility operated a substation at the site from to The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PGE about the cleanup for a year They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer asthma and skin disorders The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup PGE will clean the area around a shed on Billeccis property something it had not planned to do before Billecci said he is pleased that PGE agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates when deregulation begins Residential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about percent Thats according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission Under the new socalled pricetobeat rate which still needs PUC approval someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save over the course of a year while someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save annually The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed This years increase though was rescinded as gas prices came down The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan when Texas opens its electricity market to competition is known as the price to beat Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors which in turn are expected to offer lower rates Other incumbent electric companies including Dallasbased TXU Energy will charge their own pricetobeat rates in their service territories The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices To set the price to beat the PUC uses complex formulas Costs are sorted into several categories including a base rate as well as costs tied to the price of natural gas which affects the price of electricity Under the deregulation law consumers automatically get a percent cut in the base portion starting Jan which depending on usage can make up percent of a consumers costs The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the socalled fuelfactor portion of the price to beat The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company The threemember commission still must give its approval which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec meeting The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses kilowatthours of electricity in a year or an average of a month is cents per kilowatthour Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday the cost would be cents per kilowatthour Thats a drop of percent Those per kilowatthour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher Reliant charges different rates for summer and non summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins The per kilowatthour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized average rates All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an applestoapples way to compare them Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the baserate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose percent of their customers The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs Earlier this week consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC if adopted could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers That option which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed isnt included in Reliants filing A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea and its unknown whether the PUC will ever take an upordown vote Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be In a filing Thursday with the PUC the New Power Co which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program New Power said New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition but like everyone else we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds it said

is in talks with rival energy company Dynegy Inc DNY for a cash infusion or possible merger The embattled company also restated four and a half years of earnings Thursday FERC orders state to pay its power bills SACRAMENTO Power generators called gougers and worse by state officials are getting help from federal regulators to collect about billion they are owed by the state And in another energyrelated development a conservative legalaction group the United States Justice Foundation in Escondido filed a lawsuit to overturn billion worth of longterm power contracts obtained by the state The state has not been paying generators for lastminute power purchases made by the Independent System Operator since January to maintain adequate power levels in the California grid The ISO which is controlled by appointees of Gov Gray Davis has been sending the bills for the purchases to the financially troubled utilities even though the state began buying power for utility customers in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday ordered the ISO to bill the state powerpurchasing agency the Department of Water Resources and to report the amount owed in days and schedule payment within three months We certainly intend to comply with that order said Greg Fishman an ISO spokesman Fishman said the ISO has not been sending the bills for lastminute power to the water department because of a previous federal requirement that was interpreted to mean that the bill should be sent to the user of the electricity in this case the utilities In addition he said the water department has not been willing to pay bills unless it receives detailed information about the price and seller of power that had been withheld in the past to preserve a competitive market It was not clear yesterday whether the bills that the ISO will begin sending the water department will contain the specific information that department says it needs to make a payment If the bill is adequate we will pay it said Oscar Hidalgo a water department spokesman If we get a bill that is an aggregate bill a lump sum a generator could come to us a month from now and say You never paid me As it operates the grid the ISO routinely makes lastminute purchases because the exact amount of power needed to maintain adequate levels in the grid cannot be predicted and purchased in advance Pacific Gas and Electric contended earlier this year that the state was trying to reduce its power costs by sending the bill for lastminute purchases to the utilities Hidalgo said the estimate that generators are owed about billion for providing lastminute power is based on the unpaid bills that the utilities sent back to the ISO The federal commission said it was acting to prevent difficulties for the ISO in obtaining future energy and to ensure the prompt payment needed for a proper marketplace What a comedy of errors said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum a generator group Thats a good way to make friends not pay them billion Two generators Mirant and Reliant have filed a complaint with the FERC contending that the ISO gives preferential treatment to the water department that undermines generators required by the FERC to provide lastminute power to the ISO Among other things the generators say the ISO gives the water department advance notice of a power shortage which allows the department to provide the lastminute power from cheaper outofmarket sources A hearing on the complaint by Mirant and Reliant has been scheduled for Tuesday by state Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market Earlier this year the state negotiated more than longterm contracts to curb soaring wholesale power prices But critics say the average price of power under the contracts is now about twice as high as power on the spot market The lawsuit filed by the United States Justice Foundation argues that the contracts are illegal because of violations of contracting policy and antitrust laws This lawsuit seeks to invalidate these unfair and illegal contracts and put market forces back to work in the California electricity market said Gary Kreep executive director of the nonprofit foundation Legal groups suit seeks to overturn power deals A conservative legal group filed a lawsuit yesterday that seeks to invalidate the estimated billion worth of longterm electricity contracts signed by the state The United States Justice Foundation contends that the contracts violate the state constitution for several different reasons including the fact that they were negotiated in secret by people who may have had conflicts of interest Gov Gray Davis illegally negotiated these contracts in secret said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge These contracts are the result not of simple misjudgment and incompetence They are the result of misconduct The lawsuit filed yesterday in Sacramento Superior Court also alleges that by negotiating in secret the Davis administration violated states open meetings laws Davis officials began signing longterm energy contracts last winter as a part of its attempt to reign in energy crisis They argue that the contracts helped lower wholesale electricity prices in California The administration came under attack after it was revealed that some of the negotiators also owned stock in the companies they were negotiating with GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES PLANNED FOR CANADA VENEZUELA Kvaerner has much to be thankful for having just received US million in contracts from Westcoast Energy for the engineering design fabrication construction and commissioning of a gas processing facility Last fall Westcoast Energys Pipeline and Field Services division announced plans to build a million cubic feet per day MMcfd natural gas pretreatment facility near its existing Pine River gas plant located in the northeastern part of the Province of British Columbia This facility will process sour natural gas and facilitate the addition of MMcfd of gas to flow from the Pine River gas plant to markets in the lower mainland of British Columbia and the US Pacific Northwest according to our source The plant will process and ship this gas on behalf of area producers as an addition to the existing Pine River plant and Grizzly Valley gathering system It will feed into the existing Westcoast Energy mainline that runs from northeastern BC to Huntington at the CanadaUS border Construction began in August and operations are targeted to begin next summer the source stated Meanwhile Duke Energy is continuing with its strategy to expand its natural gas infrastructure throughout North America by acquiring Westcoast Energy in an billion deal that is scheduled for completion early next year see Midstream Oct The Nov issue of GPR provided an indepth view of Dukes efforts to strengthen its position in the North American gas market why it feels this

November PGE to attack public power in court Utility prepares allout offensive if final vote backs SF initiative SF Gate News November US Power Gas Companies Restrict Dealings With Enron Dow Jones Interactive November Study details problems with utility deregulation Dow Jones Interactive November Tally shows SF poised to operate its own water power agency With springs blackouts and rate increases beginning to fade from memory San Francisco was on the verge of becoming a public power city Wednesday amid promises of lower prices stable supplies and an end to PGEs monopoly San Francisco is set to join Los Angeles Sacramento Palo Alto and other California cities with publicly owned utilities and hopes to offer comparably low electricity rates once its new municipal water and power agency is in place But if anything is certain the day after the election it is that nothing is certain about the future of public power in San Francisco With ballots uncounted Measure F led by about votes Then there are enormous political and legal hurdles to creating a public utility Among the most daunting Coping with likely legal opposition from Pacific Gas Electric which has vowed to fight any takeover of its assets Electing a board of directors from seven San Francisco districts and agreeing on how to proceed Patching together a power supply from the citys Hetch Hetchy system new solar energy sources and electricity purchases on the open market The complex electricity market the uncertainty of San Franciscos budding solar initiatives and the potential legal delays mean the citys ratepayers will not see any changes soon said Severin Borenstein director of the University of Californias Energy Institute Theres a chance that despite the vote San Francisco wont wind up with a municipal utility he said I think this is a shot across the bow but its going to unfold over the course of years not weeks or months If people think suddenly were going to see a huge change in the industry I think theyre misreading PGE officials on Wednesday refused to speculate about the future of the bankrupt utilitys operations in San Francisco But the company pointed out that a second ballot initiative Measure I to create a municipal utility district for San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane had apparently failed and that Measure Fs lead was still razorthin With the apparent failure of the municipal utility district a very close vote on Proposition F and a very low voter turnout there is no strong sentiment in favor of municipalization in San Francisco said an official statement Public power advocates painted a more optimistic picture saying the obstacles to getting a city power agency running were not insurmountable and that the failure of the more legally troubled Measure I means municipal power will flow sooner than if both measures had passed We lost a big battle but we won the war for public power said Ross Mirkarimi director of the Yes on I and F campaign San Francisco can begin its conversion to a water and power authority The mechanics of establishing the new agency are sketched out in the ballot language Later this month the San Francisco Board of Supervisors will carve out seven electoral districts and candidates for the board of directors will be required to declare for office in December The election is scheduled for the first week in March and if necessary a runoff will be held in April The new board will be seated in May and its first action is expected to be commissioning a study showing how best to bring public power to San Francisco There are a number of possibilities said Ed Smeloff assistant general manager for power policy at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission The citys PUC which operates the Hetch Hetchy Water and Power System would be absorbed by the new power agency Options include building the citys own electricity delivery system leasing PGEs lines to deliver power to the city or buying PGEs power plants and distribution system outright at a cost PGE estimates at million to billion The cityrun utility would be able to take advantage of tax breaks and lowinterest loans to acquire the system and repay the debt much like a mortgage The agency would be authorized to purchase PGEs assets through eminent domain You have to look at the data to decide if you can lower rates by buying out the PGE system Smeloff said Thats the purpose of the study Its possible it could be less costly to use PGEs lines and pay them for the delivery of power Even Measure Fs most active supporters on Wednesday were beginning to talk about a municipal utility that stops short of a full takeover of the PGE system In this economic climate you might be able to buy power more cheaply without taking over the infrastructure of PGE Mirkarimi said With an energy glut coming on the market they may be able to obtain power other ways The point is we have options PGE to attack public power in court Utility prepares allout offensive if final vote backs SF initiative Pacific Gas and Electric Co faced with the prospect of losing its right to sell power in its hometown after Tuesdays vote is preparing an all out legal battle to block seizure of the utilitys power lines senior executives said yesterday Officially PGEs message following Tuesdays vote is that support for public power is only marginal at best There is no strong sentiment in favor of municipalization in San Francisco the utility said in a brief statement Privately PGE executives said the utility would do anything it takes to stop public power from becoming a reality in San Francisco A final ballot count will not be available until today at the earliest But it appeared yesterday that Proposition F was headed toward victory The measure would allow an elected board to declare eminent domain and purchase PGEs San Francisco power lines The fate of a related publicpower measure Proposition I remained uncertain PGE executives said utility officials from throughout the Bay Area had been summoned to the companys San Francisco headquarters yesterday for a high level war council on the election outcome Although a longterm strategy for fighting the publicpower initiative remained elusive the meetings participants agreed that PGEs attorneys must go on the attack the executives said requesting anonymity The company reportedly spent more than million in an attempt to defeat the measures and if either passes the utility is ready to shell out millions more to tie things up in court If you look at past history weve always been aggressive about protecting our property one executive said Bring it on countered Ross Mirkarimi campaign manager for the public power measures The absolute arrogance of a bankrupt corporation threatening to dismiss the intent of voters will be met in court and successfully beaten back he said Any legal defense of propositions F and I would be made by the city attorneys office A spokesperson for outgoing City Attorney Louise Renne declined to comment on the matter yesterday But a wellplaced source in Rennes office scoffed at the suggestion that PGE even with its deep pockets would be able to bully San Francisco in court This is a lawyer office which is larger than most law firms in the city the source said If PGE chooses to they can try and paper us to death But that will not affect the outcome The source said it appeared most likely that PGE would attempt to challenge the publicpower initiatives on constitutional grounds in federal court Such a challenge could last at least two years the source said PGE will not handle this with inhouse lawyers the source at the city attorneys office added Theyll hire an outside firm and pay up to an hour for legal help Meanwhile the city will use salaried deputy city attorneys This will be much cheaper for us PGE which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after running up more than billion in debt under a rate freeze stressed in its statement late yesterday that numerous hurdles still must be be overcome before a public utility could be created in San Francisco It is important to recognize that there are still many other steps the city government and San Francisco voters must approve before any municipalization outcome could occur the company said An agency has to be formed commissioners elected and a feasibility study conducted to determine if the city can run the system and justify a takeover John Nelson a spokesman for the utility declined to comment further PGE has been fighting off publicpower initiatives in San Francisco since the s One utility official said that unlike similar battles elsewhere there was a pride factor involved for what is seen as the companys home turf This is where our headquarters is and our employees take a lot of pride in what they do the official said In fact no major California city has succeeded in establishing a public utility for nearly years since Sacramento took charge of its local power system Only about a quarter of all Californians receive electricity from a public entity And if PGE has its way that number will not grow The utility amassed a war chest of last year to crush a grassroots effort seeking a public utility in Davis PGE hired a small army of lobbyists and consultants and ultimately prevailed by killing off the ballot measure This kind of thing comes up every couple of years somewhere in our service area a utility executive said In all cases weve fought fairly aggressively US Power Gas Companies Restrict Dealings With Enron NEW YORK Dow Jones Trading companies in Enron Corps ENE key North American power and gas markets are restricting their dealings with the ailing Houstonbased giant people at those companies said Wednesday Concerns have mounted because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on its Internetbased system EnronOnline has seen its share price fall by about and its credit ratings downgraded since midOctober due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Weve restricted our business with them said Mike Smith chief financial officer for Mirant Corp MIR unit Mirant Americas Group a Top trader of power and gas in the US Smith wouldnt be more specific but his comments echoed those of others in the business Our exposure to Enron is insignificant compared with the previous exposure said Al Butkus spokesman for Aquila Inc ILA a Top US power and gas trader Tractebel Energy Marketing the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel SA has limited the term of transactions with Enron to three years or less a person at the company said And a power broker said some medium sized western utilities have stopped trading with Enron even for nearterm delivery Enron didnt return calls seeking comment The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Enron was in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by competitor Dynegy Inc DYN Also Enron said Thursday it was restating its financial statements from through the second quarter of saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods The company fired its treasurer and general counsel Key Markets Enrons ability to transact in its core markets North American wholesale gas and power is essential if the company maintain the earnings and cash flow needed to emerge from its current credit crisis Wall Street analysts and ratings agencies have said Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service downgraded Enrons credit to within two steps of junkbond status last week and have it on watch for further downgrade Enron still has its supporters Exelon Corp EXC is monitoring its own risk management but hasnt changed its relationship with Enron said Chief Financial Officer Ruth Ann M Gillis We havent changed our relationship Gillis said Enron is a very important factor in the vitality of the wholesale energy markets she said Theyre still the largest best of the companies out there she said Likewise a trading floor manager at one energy company said Enron called earlier in the week and asked that the company increase its trading on EnronOnline The companys EOL volumes had fallen but it honored Enrons request out of respect for Enrons still marketmaking power PPL Corp PPL moved to mitigate its exposure to Enron following the downgrades a person in the marketing organization at PPL EnergyPlus said Enron would not be a first choice to do longterm transactions the person said For shorter terms deals they wouldnt be considered equally with everyone else Theres just too much risk there Since Enrons troubles began several weeks ago energy trading partners had stood by the company in ways that stock and bond traders hadnt Until this week business as usual was an almost constant refrain Energy companies immediate exposure to Enron was limited to a maximum of seven weeks of receivables and Enron was paying its bills But for some of those companies business as usual also meant not changing valueatrisk formulas even though the formulas were generating ever lower allowable volumes of business with Enron as the companys credit quality deteriorated one risk manager said Wednesday Lower valueatrisk limits got most trading companies to flatten their portfolios by taking positions to offset currently profitable longterm positions with Enron PPL for example is still following its credit policy and as a result has limited its dealings with Enron which has seen its credit quality fall the person at PPL EnergyPlus said Weve taken a look at our book the person said Based on the events of this and last week weve taken some action to mitigate the risk based on their ratings downgrade Trading companies constantly evaluate their counterparties credit and adjust their dealings accordingly but rarely have been required to address problems on the scale of Enrons recent difficulties It certainly ranks just behind California the person at PPL said Enron Claims Trading Normal An Enron spokesman reached later said the company continues to see a normal range of transactions including longterm deals Weve not seen closing out of positions spokesman Eric Thode said Susan Abbott a managing director in corporate finance at Moodys said the ratings agency wasnt aware of significant changes in trading companies dealings with Enron The agency continues to watch for new restrictions in particular margin calls which could quickly strain Enrons liquidity A drop in new business with Enron isnt as much of a concern she said If youre restricting new business with the company what youre doing is moving the company out of the market in an orderly way Abbott said PPL is shying away from doing deals with Enron and is limiting the dollar amount and terms of the deals it will do with the company but hasnt yet imposed margin calls or required additional collateral the person in the marketing organization said Neither the credit thresholds nor our exposure threshold have been breached the person said PPL said its limiting exposure to Enron for shorterterm deals too the person said Their liquidity just isnt there anymore the person said No large company can afford to pull the plug on Enron given the companys centrality to the power and gas markets Enron is such a large player and theyre so important in terms of maintaining the liquidity of the markets said Sandy Fruhman spokeswoman for Reliant Energy Inc REI We see this as a situation that has potential downsides for the entire industry Enrons North American wholesale trading unit brought in billion in income before interest and taxes in the first nine months of the year up from billion in the same period last year Reliant continues to do business but Fruhman wouldnt say specifically whether it had restricted its dealings Were monitoring the situation carefully and making sure we follow prudent business practices she said But were trying to work with them because its in the best interest of the entire industry to overcome their current problems Study details problems with utility deregulation Whether or not Oklahoma embraces power deregulation electricity prices probably will rise The question is how much That was one conclusion in a report presented to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission Tuesday The commission ordered the study conducted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory of Tennessee to examine the states deregulation issues The study raises the key question of whether price increases can be minimized with fair treatment for both consumers and powergenerating companies It also notes that the Oklahoma and regional power grids are inadequate to handle new power plants coming on line Its sort of like walking a tightrope said Stanton W Hadley an Oak Ridge researcher who presented the study before the commissioners Once you do it wrong its hard to go back The commission took no action Tuesday Commission Chairman Denise Bode called the meeting a brainstorming session The commission wants to sidestep the nightmare of electricity deregulation in California The Oklahoma Legislature postponed a decision this spring on deregulation The study which is Phase II of Oak Ridge research on Oklahoma deregulation issues lays out four possible scenarios for Oklahomas electric future between now and The scenarios include continued utility regulation along with three types of freemarket deregulation Under total deregulation the study said existing coal and hydroelectric plants would profit handsomely Consumer prices would probably fall at least for awhile However the numerous gasfired merchant power plants being planned or built in Oklahoma probably would lose money Some would fail Under a semideregulation scenario in which power producers would be allowed to charge more to help pay for their plants all power plants would make money the study reports But coal and hydroelectric plant profits would skyrocket even further and average prices to customers could be percent to percent higher than under regulated rates For that reason Hadley endorsed a fourth scenario in which coal and hydroelectric plants would continue under some form of regulation allowing the different types of power plants to profit more equitably Under that scenario prices of electricity generated at coal plants could be set through longterm contracts or continued regulation They would sell at their cost plus a markup that was set by regulators Such an approach he said would likely lead to a winwin situation with power plants thriving and consumers seeing only modest price increases The study also reported that power supply in Oklahoma will far outstrip demand during the period The states power capacity of megawatts will zoom to by with at least megawatts of reserve power The problem That much power would overwhelm Oklahomas power grid Power lines were built to serve local customers not to export huge quantities of electricity Right now those lines can carry some of the proposed capacity but not all Hadley said Bode said the reports scenarios are based on todays power transmission capacity The critical question she said is how much transmission capacity to build and how to make it possible for new power plants to hook into that grid Youve got to build your infrastructure first Bode said We could have a real serious mess in if we dont get more transmission built About gasfired power plants are either planned or are being built in gasrich Oklahoma Power merchants need to be able to ship electricity a valueadded product of the states natural gas supply out of state Bode said By the same token she said the state needs to be able to retain enough reserve electric power to attract industry fuel economic growth and keep power prices reasonable Douglas Burton of Oklahoma Citybased Acarus Group representing major Oklahoma industrial power consumers urged Bode and Commissioner Bob Anthony to consider a regional power grid concept sharing the cost of transmission expansion with surrounding states Burton called for no transmission welfare She insisted that if Oklahoma tried to build a regional grid by itself it wouldnt lead to a competitive market Hadley advised a goslow approach to the wealth of issues and unknowns surrounding deregulation Better to take more time he said and do it right

million in profit Lower power costs rate increases boost earnings PGE Corp enjoyed a percent jump in profit during the third quarter as its utility operations reaped an extra million from a drop in power costs and record rate increases passed last spring Despite millions in costs related to Pacific Gas and Electric Cos bankruptcy case and other losses the utilitys San Francisco parent company yesterday reported million in net income for the three months that ended Sept up from million during the yearago period However the thirdquarter profit could just be a blip The utility could see profits fall if demand wanes during the winter months when usage declines said PGE Corp spokesman Brian Hertzog Profit could also decline in future quarters if the state of California boosts its demand for a share of ratepayer revenue he said The state has been buying power on behalf of utility customers since January when PGE buckled under soaring wholesale electricity rates For the past quarter the company reported net income from operations of million cents per share a slight gain from last year when it posted million in net income from operations cents The million in profit flowing into PGE Corps coffers in just three months spurred consumer advocates to push for rate refunds It just shows were paying too much for energy now said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network Hoge said the company financial report which shows a billion cash balance strengthens the groups claim that Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy filing in April was unnecessary to pay off the utilitys debts Hertzog said the thirdquarter generation profit pales in comparison to the losses PGE sustained last winter when power prices skyrocketed and the utility was prevented by a rate freeze from passing on the costs to consumers The company wrote off billion in unpaid costs though it is suing to force the PUC to allow the utility to recover the money from ratepayers Terrie Prosper a spokeswoman for the PUC said PGE Corp may not get to keep the million The quarterly statement reflects money that PGE Corp is collecting that the PUC hasnt decided how to allocate Energy price probes widen to include state officials Chief of power grid to be questioned In June as Californians braced for a summer of rolling blackouts television cameras captured allegations from former Duke Energy employees that seemed to pin the states energy mess on power providers The selfdescribed whistleblowers told a legislative committee that Duke withheld power during the peak of California s electricity shortage to boost prices charges the company denied But more than four months later and at a cost that could top million statesponsored investigations into the energy crisis have yielded no civil or criminal penalties against power providers In fact some probes started to scrutinize energy companies are now targeting other big players in the California energy market state officials Investigators are looking into a range of accusations from why the head of the state power grid helped open the flood gates to massive electricity price hikes to new complaints that the state department buying power is manipulating the market Under subpoena Terry Winter who runs the California Independent System Operator will be deposed today in the state Capitol The new questions have broadened the scope of the investigations into who the real culprit is in the states electricity crisis Whos the bad guy The better question is who is wearing the white hat said Gary Ackerman spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum a trade group representing generators When California blackouts became a punchline for latenight comedians several state agencies began investigations Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced he was investigating pricegouging by generators He convened a grand jury in June to discover whether generators had purposely withheld power to the market to drive up prices The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation was created by the Legislature Run by Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana the committee hosted the Duke whistleblowers and issued a flurry of subpoenas for records kept by energy providers The Public Utilities Commission also began looking into the market and into allegations that generators had idled plants at key times All three investigations are continuing The PUC has spent more than on its review Lockyer has million to spend on his work and Dunns committee is spending about per month Lockyer has said he is looking into complaints that energy consultants hired by Gov Gray Davis had conflicts of interest One consultant allegedly helped negotiate a longterm energy contract with an electricity provider he had recently worked for The states Fair Political Practices Commission and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are also exploring conflictof interest charges that led Davis to fire five consultants Dunns committee is still looking into market manipulation by generators But he has spent more time recently investigating the actions of state officials Dunn wants to know why the head of the ISO Winter asked federal regulators on Dec to drop caps on the price companies could charge for power Winter made his pitch to the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee without telling Davis or his bosses the person ISO board that had regularly voted for strict price caps The committee quickly approved Winters request and energy prices began soaring While ISO officials contend Winter had to kill price caps to keep generators interested in selling power to the state Dunn is looking into whether Winter and the generators somehow colluded to drive up prices ISO officials deny that Winter worked with generators to drop price caps It seems ludicrous that Terry Winter wouldnt tell his bosses that he was about to take the boldest step in ISO history Dunn said Dunns committee also is probing recent complaints from generators that the state is manipulating the energy market The state Department of Water Resources which began buying power in January after cashstrapped utilities no longer could is demanding exclusive information about the power market from the ISO generators allege The department also has refused to pay generators for electricity its buying unless its told what generators costs are That information could lead to one of the biggest buyers in the market the state with more data than other competitors creating an unfair playing field generators argue While a DWR spokesman said the department is working with generators to address their concerns the generators have asked federal regulators to step in But Dunn said hell investigate whatever group is wreaking havoc in the energy market If those allegations are true we now have a market participant exercising an undue influence on the market he said Theyre doing the same things the generators were accused of PGE ReEvaluating New Construction of Pwr Plants Execs LOS ANGELES Dow Jones PGE Corp PCG is reevaluating how much new generation it will build in future years due to declining market demand and the impact of utility Pacific Gas and Electric Cos bankrutpcy company executives said on an earnings call with analysts Monday Previously we have said we will have megawatts in said Tom Boren President and CEO of PGE Corps National Energy Group unit Thats still being evaluated so we cant give new projections but its likely to be less than MW The company will proceed with the construction of current projects worth MW and tolling arrangements worth Boren added We are not cancelling development projects at this time and we are also moving forward with construction of the North Baja natural gas pipeline Boren said The companys reevaluation of how much generation it will build has more to do with the outlook of future market conditions than the condition of the company itself Boren said He declined to say if the company was reconsidering projects in a certain area of the country in particular Boren made his statements during a conference call on the companys thirdquarter earnings As reported the companys quarterly net income more than tripled but earnings excluding items increased just and missed Wall Street forecasts Though the company expects to see an growth in earnings per share from operations several executives said that will be a challenging transition year Several controversial regulatory and legal steps needed to implement the utilitys plan of reorganization under its Chapter bankruptcy proceedings will be put to the test in said PGE Corp Chair CEO and President Bob Glynn It will be a transition year from our current organization to our postplanofreorganization structureTheres not a member among us who thinks it will all be smooth sailing The utility is already facing adverse regulatory decisions and the energy group is facing reduced forward prices for power Glynn said The utility filed a reorganization plan in September that would transfer all the utilitys transmission and generating assets to unregulated subsidiaries then spin off Pacific Gas and Electric as a publiclytraded retail distributor of electricity and natural gas One immediate challenge facing Pacific Gas and Electric is Tuesdays ballot measures in San Francisco to create a municipal power district If the measures succeed the utility would lose of its customers The utility is strongly opposed to the ballot initiatives If they pass there will be years and years of litigation said Chris Warner regulatory counsel for PGE The initiatives wouldnt affect the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction or schedule however The utility is scheduled to explain its disclosure statement on the reorganization plan before a federal bankruptcy judge Dec If the judge approves the statement it will be mailed to creditors for a vote If it passes muster another court hearing will be held to confirm the plan Creditors seem to favor the plan and therefore the company isnt seeking any alternative such as a settlement reached between state regulators and California s other financially troubled utility Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison a PGE executive said SoCal Edisons settlement of a federal lawsuit with the California Public Utilities Commission will allow it to bill its customers for billion in debt and repay creditors using cash on hand PGE has filed a similar federal lawsuit against the commission claiming it has the right to raise retail rates to recover power costs That lawsuit is on hold while the court determines how it interacts with a related decision made in bankruptcy court said utility CEO and President Gordon Smith Another pending matter for the utility is a determination by the Department of Water Resources of how much revenue it will need from the utility through to pay for power purchases The DWR has been buying power on behalf of the states creditstrapped utilities since January Pacific Gas and Electric has been paying an interim price of cents a kilowatt hour since March for that DWR power Were expecting a revised revenue requirement from the DWR as early as today Warner said The last announcement on Oct was that the overall requirement had shrunk by billion so we expect the requirement will go down accordingly for each utility No one at the DWR was immediately available to comment on the status of the revenue requirement San Francisco to vote on public power SAN FRANCISCO Nov Reuters After a year which saw Californias energy system thrown into unprecedented turmoil San Francisco votes on Tuesday on two proposals to establish a public power agency to take over the functions of struggling utility giant Pacific Gas Electric PGE The two ballot initiatives Measure F and Measure I aim to make San Francisco the latest city in the country to set up a municipal utility district MUD a potential blow to PGE which still serves some million customers in northern and central California despite having declared bankruptcy in April at the height of the states power crisis Backed by businesses ranging from garbage companies to telecommunications firms that fear they could also be targeted by voters eager to take charge of their own city services Pacific Gas Electric has spent more than million in an aggressive advertising campaign which describes the MUD idea as unrealistic and inefficient But supporters of the MUD proposals ranging from environmental activists to consumer groups say the time has come for San Francisco to fashion a utility district that is a nonprofit public entity rather than a dividendpaying division of a major energy firm The profit that is generated by the sale transmission and management of electricity is realized back into the rate structure said Ross Mirkarimi campaign manager for the group supporting the MUD proposals Our utility ratepayers in San Francisco will see lower rates in a very quick period of time while we move from being an abused renter of a neglecting landlord like PGE to owning our own infrastructure The battle over San Franciscos MUD proposals which local pollsters say are running neckandneck takes place after months of chaos as Californias energy deregulation effort unexpectedly resulted in skyrocketing wholesale power prices periodic blackouts sharply higher consumer rates and financial crisis for the states major utilities RELIABLE AFFORDABLE ENERGY Pacific Gas Electric a division of PGE Corp declared bankruptcy in April after running up billions of dollars in unpaid wholesale energy bills The utility continues to function however and has repeatedly said it intends to use the bankruptcy process to put its finances in order The MUD proposal could threaten that plan Under Proposition F San Francisco would create a power agency run by a governing board while Proposition I calls for San Francisco and the neighboring town of Brisbane to establish a municipal utility district with an elected board of directors That board would then consider whether or not San Francisco should take over PGEs power transmission and distribution system in the city as well as the citys small generating facilities owned by PGE and Mirant Corp Supporters say a MUD would deliver reliable affordable energy pointing to existing municipal utility districts in Sacramento Los Angeles and other California cities as examples of how public power can shield consumers from the increasingly wild swings of deregulated energy markets Opponents of the measure say it would thrust San Francisco into a role it is illequipped to play developing a new city bureaucracy and then sending it out to compete with big league energy players in the the fastpaced and often cutthroat world of the power markets Unlike established MUDs San Francisco would not only have to buy the citys existing power infrastructure at a cost of anywhere up to billion but might also find itself jockeying for power without the benefit of longterm contracts which have kept consumer rates low in places like Sacramento Despite the jitters in the business community the MUD proposal is backed by a number of major state and local political leaders as well as organized labor Passage of one or both of the MUD proposals Tuesday does not guarantee that San Francisco would see a public power system established any time soon PGE has promised a court fight against any attempts by the city to seize its power infrastructure by eminent domain meaning the measures could end up tangled in lengthy legal argument

can boost green power usestudy Dow Jones Interactive November India ONGC Plans Enron OilGas Field Bid If BG Deal Fails Dow Jones Interactive November Calif Generators Say State Still Dodging Its Power Bills LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California power generators have complained to federal regulators that despite recent assurances the state has yet to provide credit guarantees for electricity sold through California s wholesale power market and is deliberately delaying payment for hundreds of millions of dollars in past power sales In a filing this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission generators accused the California Independent System Operator the states wholesale market administrator and the California Department of Water Resources the states powerbuying arm of engaging in a shell game to keep power flowing for free despite a FERC order that payment be guaranteed It appears that the ISOs refusal to implement settlement and billing procedures consistent with the orders is simply part of a shell game to avoid compliance with those orders the generators said in their filing This must be put to a stop The filing by Reliant Energy Inc REI Duke Energy North America DUK Dynegy Inc DYN and Mirant Corp MIR is an attempt to pressure FERC to hold hearings on the issue one of the generators in the complaint said The parties also want FERC to order the ISO to bill the water department for the power theyve supplied A FERC spokesman said the commission is looking into the complaints and expects to meet on the issue sometime in November At issue is power sold through the California ISO which is primarily responsible for keeping supply and demand in balance on the grid but which also operates a wholesale market to buy and sell power for that purpose The state has paid billion for electricity purchased directly from suppliers but it has yet to pay at least billion for lastminute power reserve capacity and other services supplied to the ISO since January The ISO has yet to bill the DWR for those services both parties agree Williams Has Booked Revenues Assurances by California earlier this month that it would back those power sales and work out the unpaid debt led Williams Cos WMB to book million in revenue from previous ISO power sales in the third quarter Williams which said it filed a separate complaint with FERC that dovetails with the other generators filing said it continues to believe it will be paid for the power sales it booked Duke said it has taken reserves covering all its exposure to the ISO Dynegy and Reliant said they have also taken reserves A Mirant spokesman couldnt immediately respond to a request for comment The ISO and the California Department of Water Resources the agency handling the states power purchases denied there is any deliberate effort to keep generators from getting paid Instead complicated accounting and confidentiality issues have made it impossible for the ISO to bill the DWR for the purchases delaying payment they said Basically we cant send a bill to the DWR because it would include information that were not supposed to share with other market participants ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Unless the DWR can get permission from the suppliers and it is my understanding that they have not been able to do that we are between a rock and a hard place in our ability to provide the information needed to settle The DWR wants a breakdown of individual transactions The ISO however is prohibiting by federal rules from sharing confidential market information with other market participants unless the parties agree Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the DWR said the agency attempted to obtain approval from generators to have the ISO release the electricity sales data but has so far been unsuccessful The ISO has been working on a settlement procedure but the parties cant agree on a single solution Fishman said There are potential solutions out there but not one that everyone can agree to Fishman said Generators called the claims ridiculous The ISO is bound to bill and the CDWR is bound to pay for these ISO purchases they said in the filing In April FERC ordered the ISO to find a creditworthy backer for power purchased to serve utility customers In various filings the ISO indicated the DWR was filling that role In midOctober the DWR spelled out which power purchases it would back The generators criticized that list as incomplete Our understanding is the DWR picked up net short and they are responsible to pay for the net short said Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a trade group representing power suppliers that also filed a complaint this week with FERC A significant amount of money is in arrears and we still have this Whos backing what game USA Stung Californians not crowing at Enrons troubles SAN FRANCISCO Nov Reuters If theres one market that might applaud the mounting financial woes facing energy giant Enron Corp its California whose power sector was shattered by the market deregulation that Enron tirelessly champions Last summer angry Californians tossed a pie at Enron exChief Executive Jeff Skilling during a speech here in which he blamed state regulators for causing the energy crisis California officials led by Governor Gray Davis blasted Houstonbased Enron and other outofstate power companies for creating the emergency accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices But with Enron now facing a credit crunch and a fullscale probe by US regulators into questionable financial dealings California officials are holding back their harshest criticism saying instead there are lessons to be learned from Enrons predicament And some of Enrons toughest critics among them Davis and Loretta Lynch president of the states Public Utilities Commission CPUC would not discuss the companys woes You reap what you sow but I dont think anyone wants to pile on them right now said a state government source Many Californians cited ongoing business and creditor links with Enron as reasons not to hurl stones at the energy giant Enron is by far the nations largest trader of electricity and natural gas with energy analysts estimating it is involved in some percent of daily trade in those markets Transactions on the companys widely watched Internetbased EnronOnline trading system are estimated currently to average billion to billion a day BUSINESS CYCLES Business cycles come and go said Greg Pruett spokesman for San Franciscobased energy company PGE Corp whose Pacific Gas Electric unit California s biggest utility filed for federal bankruptcy protection in April in the wake of the energy mess We are wrestling with our own situation and you can appreciate what Enron is going through We have done business with Enron for a long time and will continue to do business with them in the future Pruett said California s power agencies forced into buying emergency electricity for the state earlier this year when the states investorowned utilities ran out of credit and cash said they have financial ties with Enron Their situation is not ringing alarm bells for us said Gregg Fishman a spokesman for the Independent System Operator ISO which manages the state power grid The ISO owes Enron money for purchases of daily power supplies but Fishman declined to say how much Aside from a day supply contract earlier this year Enron does not have any current power deals with the states Department of Water Resources said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the agency which negotiates longterm agreements One top California energy regulator however said Enrons troubles offer an important lesson for energy markets Carl Wood a CPUC commissioner said the deregulation of markets for basic services like electricity threatens as much financial volatility and instability as we have seen in the telecommunications and the dotcom industries Wood said Enron is the flagship for deregulation but there are definite dangers of venturing into unregulated market behavior Enron itself apparently is becoming a victim of sorts Our largest utility is in bankruptcy One obvious conclusion is to keep the energy industry on a pretty short regulatory leash The unregulated energy industry rises faster but it also falls further said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayers and Consumer Rights an advocacy group in Santa Monica California Its okay for a free market to operate for things like computers and other goods but energy is different Regulatory structures are needed to protect customers he said Enron Portland Genl Sale Seen Going Smoothly This Time LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Enron Corps ENE current troubles wont jeopardize its billion sale of utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co NWN analysts and the companies said In contrast to Enrons previous attempt to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources SRP which foundered earlier this year on regulatory issues the sale to the Portland Orebased gas utility is expected to go smoothly It will need to as Enron has said it is counting on sales of assets including Portland General to pay off billion in notes coming due during the next months Enron has wanted out of this asset for a very long time said Susan Abbott an analyst with Moodys Investor Services Right now they need to sell some assets and this would be a larger one that would give them some cash The energy giants shares have lost about twothirds of their value in the past three weeks and its credit ratings have been downgraded to within two steps of noninvestment grade levels due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Those uncertainties were sparked Enrons billion reduction in shareholder equity related to transactions with entities headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow The notes coming due are also related to those entities Enrons dealings with those entities are the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have raised investor hackles over a perceived lack of transparency Analysts said none of this will change plans for the Portland General sale which will bring Enron billion in cash million in Northwest Natural Gas preferred stock and million in common stock Earlier Problems Not Seen Repeated In April a twoyear old deal to sell the utility to Nevada company Sierra Pacific Resources SRP for billion collapsed due to changes in that states laws that would have forbidden the utilitys recovery of power costs if the sale went through The deal had already been doomed for months due to Sierra Pacifics tenuous financial position But Northwest Naturals financial house is in order and there is no apparent law or regulation that threatens to block the deal in Oregon or Washington the two states where approval is needed analysts said Northwest Natural is very wellregarded by regulators in both states and I think theres quite a bit of interest on the part of regulators to have the utility in local hands as opposed to somewhere down in Texas said Gerald Keenan utility analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers Concerns about the quality of Enrons credit may encourage state regulators to act more quickly on the sale an analyst said If I were a regulator Id be much more interested in having Portland General out from under Enron the analyst said The Oregon Public Utilities Commission hopes to expedite its review of the sale so that it is complete in six months rather than the usual commission spokesman Bob Valdez said Given the fact that we are familiar with the management and regulatory affairs of both companies and have dealt with them extensively we hope it will take no longer than six months said Valdez adding that the commission expected to receive a filing on the sale Nov The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission hasnt received a filing but once it does there is no statutory time limit on review a spokeswoman said Federal Review Seen Uneventful In addition to Oregon and Washington utilities regulators the sale must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the US Securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade Commission the US Department of Justice and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission None has received filings yet on the sale which is slated for completion in the fourth quarter of We are shooting for midNovember as far as submitting our request to the state commissions Northwest Natural Gas spokesman Steve Sechrist said Those will be the first major hurdle then well move on to the federal filings Shareholders must also approve the acquisition They will likely vote in spring of Sechrist said Northwest Natural Enron and analysts said they dont expect hangups at the federal level The only thing that might create a problem for the sale Keenan said would be a significant deterioration of the natural gas or electricity markets harming the companies Right now however things look good on that front The market is much more stable than it was when Sierra Pacific tried to buy the utility And the deal is much more practical this time the price is lower and the terms are better he said Clearly its important for Enron to be able to get this done and I think they will USA Customer choice can boost green power usestudy NEW YORK Nov Reuters Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by percent by the end of the decade regardless of whether the market is deregulated a federal study said But theres a catch While percent of US electricity already comes from hydro and another percent comes from wind solar and geothermal sources stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the percent goal will require more socalled green pricing programs which are often more expensive to the consumer According to the study pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal oil gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices Indeed the study showed some customers will go green even if the price is higher than conventional sources Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace said Blair Swezey coauthor of the study Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Both organizations are US Department of Energy national laboratories The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products If competitive retail markets fail to materialize utility programs must pick up the slack said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory another coauthor of the study CALIFORNIA CAVEAT Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition such as in California But in the wake of California s heavily publicized deregulation crisis the state seems to have backed away from deregulation and green power has been one of the victims The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth Wiser added noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation green power programs will remain on the backburner More than utilities in states out of more than utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized Nonhydro renewables provide about percent or megawatts MW of all the electricity used in the United States Hydropower provides about percent With the expansion of customer choice the study found the market could support about MW of additional nonhydro renewables over the next decade National Renewable Energy Laboratory based in Golden Colorado is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of Berkeley California is a scientific research

western India but the sale is subject to a number of consents and conditions including confirmation from Enron and Gas Indias joint venture partners ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd PREL that BG will inherit field operator status from Enron ONGC and Reliance Industries are challenging BGs goal of acquiring Enrons operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the PannaMukti oil and gas field BG have made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didnt get outright operatorship If BG wants to walk away well come up with a plan If they Enron offer an opportunity to bid again yes then we will think about it an ONGC spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires without elaborating further Earlier this year ONGC bid a reported million for Enrons Indian oil and gas assets only to have its bid rejected Analysts at the time said Enron was unlikely to settle for anything less than million for its stake in the venture ONGC and Reliance Industries jointly hold a stake in the assets As reported Thursday BG said it will extend the negotiation period on the operatorship of the fields for an unspecified period However analysts say BGs bid for operator status will continue to face stiff resistance from ONGC and Reliance We want the operatorship the ONGC spokesman reiterated Enrons upstream oil and gas assets in India hold proven and probable reserves of around million barrels of oil

November POWER PROBLEMS Dow Jones Interactive November Calif PUC To Pass PowerBond Measures By Jan Counsel Dow Jones Interactive November Consumer Group To Ask Judge Fri To Block SoCal Ed Deal LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A consumer group is expected to submit formal arguments Friday in US District Court in Los Angeles that a deal struck between California regulators and Southern California Edison to keep the utility out of bankruptcy violates state law San Franciscobased The Utility Reform Network succeeded Tuesday in temporarily blocking the settlement between the California Public Utilities Commission and the Edison International EIX unit which would allow Southern Californa Edison to use billion of ratepayer revenue to pay its bank debts and electricity costs after receiving a temporary stay of the deal in the th Circuit Court of Appeals The th Circuit Court of Appeals instructed TURN to argue for a permanent stay in US District Court in Los Angeles and delayed the settlement from moving forward for two weeks The consumer group is expected to argue the deal between the PUC and the utility should be voided because it was reached during two weeks of secret negotiations and because it violates state laws requiring decisions on ratemaking matters to be conducted through public hearings TURN attorney Mike Florio said the deal unfairly requires the utilitys customers to pay higher electricity costs to help the utility pay off its debt Edison executives said the utility expects to pay off its creditors during the first quarter of but the company agreed if TURN succeeds in delaying the settlement agreement the utility would be unable to pay its creditors next year Gil Alexander a spokesman for Southern California Edison said the utility will respond to TURNs arguments Tuesday US District Court Judge Ronald Lew who earlier this month rejected TURNs arguments calling the deal fair will hold a hearing on the matter Friday morning and is expected to rule at that time according to Lews court clerk The th District Court of Appeals said if TURN doesnt receive a favorable ruling from Judge Lew the group can argue its case in the th Circuit which Florio said it would do if it fails to block the deal Alexander said Southern California Edison will argue that the settlement ending a yearold lawsuit brought against the PUC is very important and meaningful for shareholders and our customers We will argue that it is very important for there to be no permanent stay and for the appeal to fail because it takes California back toward no resolution and creates further chaos he said Southern California Edison became insolvent this year because state law prohibited the utility from passing on skyrocketing electricity costs to its customers Separately TURN and other California consumer groups urged Attorney General Bill Lockyer this week to reconsider a decision his office made last month that consumer groups had no legal basis for objection or opposition to the Southern California Edison California Public Utilities Commission settlement POWER PROBLEMS The response to terrorist attacks in New York and Washington has understandably pushed a lot of other important public matters out of mind but a case can be made that some of them deserve renewed attention not in spite of the attacks but because of them Power generation is among them Earlier this year the agency that runs New Yorks power grid made a persuasive case that the state needs to bring another megawatts of power on line in the next four years to avoid the kind of power shortages that befell California All that has changed is the urgency New Yorks economy has faltered making it all the more difficult to attract industry to a state where electric rates are exorbitant while the arrival of foreign terrorism has raised concerns about the security of existing power plants What stands in the way is a plantsiting bureaucracy that recently stretched out approval of a Greene County plant to more than two years a year longer than law allows Its an agonizing process that serves mainly to discourage potential investors from even thinking of building a plant in this state especially as it compares to more streamlined processes in neighboring states such as Connecticut which gets the job done in six months Americans have depended on easy access to electricity for decades but with the advent of the microchip and all that it has produced from computers to cell phones to remote controls our reliance has increased New York barely had enough power available to get through the peak usage times of summer While the weakening economy may actually serve to decrease demand for a time that slackening should be viewed not as an excuse to delay but as a grace period that may help the state meet demand for electricity while increasing the available supply Use may or may not decline during this economic slowdown but sooner or later it is bound to rise Some advocates of a speedier siting procedure see signs of hope largely because the issue seems to have riveted the attention of the Public Service Commission which is the lead agency in the approval process Still nothing concrete has happened to suggest that the regulatory bottleneck has been opened enough to allow an efficient and careful routine to be established Given the need to protect existing supply to improve economic prospects for the future and to ensure a steady supply in the event of any kind of interruption the state needs to be sure this matter does not shortcircuit during this time of stress Calif PUC To Pass PowerBond Measures By Jan Counsel LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell billion in bonds to repay the states general fund and banks for power purchases made this year Delays in the bond issue originally planned for May may deepen the states budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the states credit ratings At this point we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale said Gary Cohen general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission The PUC refused earlier this month to pass a socalled rate agreement which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid because it would give the the states power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC In addition PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governors office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in longterm power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market One of the commissions objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade So far neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate Spokesman for Dynegy Inc DYN Williams Cos WMB Calpine Corp CPN and Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Energy SRE have said they havent been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals Williams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts but only if the result would benefit both parties Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts but the company is willing to talk with state officials The PUC met with members of Gov Gray Davis staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts and talks are ongoing Cohen said We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts Cohen said We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis said the governors office had no comment on the renegotiation talks Davis has been criticized for entering into the deals at to high a price just before the spot market for power collapsed His staff defended the contracts saying they brought stability to the spot electricity market and helped bring down prices The parties havent identified which contracts should be renegotiated Cohen said Were trying to figure out what we want to achieve how many megawatts we want and for how long and at this point I dont know the answer Cohen said It seems like to start off and just pick one to renegotiate will not be effective We need a plan Cohen said he cannot predict when renegotiations will take place but the PUC is pretty far along in its analysis A new rate agreement could be passed in a month but the PUC is aiming to have everything done by January related to the bond sale Cohen said

SCOTTSDALE Ariz Dow Jones US utilities are in no hurry to impose strict credit restrictions on future deals with troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp ENE according to utility executives gathered for a national power conference here this week Even as they nervously tracked Enrons stock plunge during coffee breaks Tuesday on their Internetenabled wireless devices and lunchtime chat Wednesday turned to the prospects for additional downgrades of the companys debt executives mostly said theyre merely evaluating their relationships with Enron at his point while hoping for the best After losing more than twothirds of their value over the past two weeks and falling to their lowest level in a decade Enron shares rose Wednesday for the first time since Oct gaining to Were very interested in their recovery said David Rozier senior vice president at Mirant Corps MIR Mirant Americas Inc noting that the demise of such a large player could have a ripple effect on markets Were looking at that situation very carefully Aquila Inc ILA which does a significant amount of trading with Enron likewise would be reluctant to make changes to that relationship said Steve Magness executive vice president in charge of strategic partnerships We would not change due to perception only for financial reasons We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties in trading added Aquila Senior Vice President and General Manager Brad Nordholm Should Enron lose its investmentgrade rating status that would affect Aquilas continued willingness to trade with Enron he said Moodys Investors Service Inc on Monday downgraded its rating on Enrons senior unsecured debt to Baa from Baa placing its rating two levels above noninvestment grade and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade Moodys said the downgrade was based on deterioration in the companys financial flexibility following an announced large quarterly loss and reduction of shareholder equity Additional unease has been created by reports about a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into certain financial transactions involving Enron European trading partners reportedly are taking a harder line with Enron than US companies which some here said could be due to foreign companies having less interest in the strength of markets here Still we want to trade in stable markets We dont want to see any major longterm problems said Trevor Pethick director of trading with Powergen PLCs PWG Energy Trading unit His company like its US counterparts is reviewing our situation with Enron he said Coral Energy a unit of Royal DutchShell continues to trade with Enron although debt downgrades do lead Coral Energy to make changes to their business relationships with any trading partner said Jeff Beicker senior vice president of trading Im not seeing people saying Lets save Enron or Lets pounce on Enron Its business as usual said Beicker The market capitalization is where theyre getting hammered He and Aquilas Magness answering questions from conference goers following a presentation on risk management downplayed the possible impact of such a large trading company as Enron going out of business Both said they would expect more alternative trading platforms to EnronOnline to emerge quickly and fill any trading voids Beicker further predicted that should Enron go under trading margins would grow and companies would have to pay more going forward for warehousing their risk The Worldwide Business Research Power conference continues Thursday at the Camelback Inn resort in Scottsdale Ariz Generators say state manipulating power market They accuse the IPO of sharing inside information with the water agency SACRAMENTO The state Department of Water Resources is demanding and getting privileged information from the states electricity grid operator that power generators say is being used to illegally manipulate the energy market The role reversal in which power generators are now accusing the state of violating federal laws to manipulate the market was at the center of two depositions taken Wednesday by a Senate committee investigating the California energy crisis The Department of Water Resources in January started buying energy for the state because the private utilities werent able to pay their bills and lawmakers feared rolling blackouts would ensue On Wednesday officers with the Independent System Operator which schedules electricity onto the states power grid told the special Senate committee that the Department of Water Resources buyers have been threatening since spring to stop buying unless they are provided with exclusive information about the grid We have heard indications that if we failed to provide information we may not have the backing an ISO vice president Jim Detmers said He said the information includes the amount of electricity the ISO is short in what is called the hourahead market The sharing of this same type of information among private generators last year led to accusations of gouging from state officials Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hildago said the information is only used to ensure the buys are a justifiable use of taxpayer money We have to stand behind those purchases and the law ABX did not give us the authority to write a blank check to the ISO he said referring to the bill that put the state in the power business State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who chairs the special committee said the state is now being accused of using privileged information to schedule controversial highpriced longterm energy contracts the state secured in the early days of the crisis The allegations from the generator community have been that DWR has wrested control of the wholesale market from ISO and they did so for purposes of dumping the longterm contracts into the market when there is lowerpriced electricity available said Dunn In an Oct filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission power generators say that this is a violation of the regulations with which the operators must comply Acting on behalf of the State the highly politicized ISO is engaged in an organized deliberate effort to subvert the market mechanisms established by the commission the filing reads Hildago countered Quite frankly the louder they scream that something is unfair that is a measure of the success we have ISO officials go public with testimony Two members of the states electric grid operator chose to give depositions to a Senate committee in public Wednesday despite a Senate resolution calling for them to be kept secret The committee wanted the secrecy to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming public according to its chairman Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana But Dunn said recently that those subpoenaed to testify could choose to do so in public On Wednesday two officials from the California Independent System Operator took him up on the offer Elena Schmid vice president of communications and strategic development and Jim Detmers vice president of operations Were an organization thats all about openness said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle Its part of our culture to want to open things up The testimony she said served the purpose of going back in time and looking at the many factors that contributed to the crisis Other energy officials will also ask the committee for public depositions she said including the president and chief executive officer Terry Winter who is scheduled to appear Tuesday The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market issued subpoenas to current and former board members and staff of the grid operator But Winters testimony will be of particular interest The actions he took Dec to lift a price cap on wholesale energy cost is at the heart of the committees investigation Dunn says Winter failed to tell the ISO board or other state officials about his request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift the permegawatt hour cap It was replaced with a soft cap requiring generators to justify their costs above A Senate resolution approved in July spelled out the ground rules for the depositions saying no one could be present except members and staff of Dunns committee the person taking the deposition an official report the person being deposed and accompanying counsel But some have questioned the secrecy saying it could make the testimony prone to manipulation In response to questions from the committees special counsel Laurence Drivon Detmers testified Wednesday about the unraveling of the electricity market in the days leading up to Dec with dispatchers scrambling every hour to find enough power to keep the lights on million to fight SF public power PGE Corp against city ballot measures The corporate parent of PGE the bankrupt California utility fighting for financial recovery has pumped more than million into a campaign to defeat a pair of public power measures on Tuesdays ballot in San Francisco Company representatives say they want to protect their assets in the city where there are Pacific Gas and Electric Co customers Independent experts say more is at stake Im sure they dont want to see a snowball effect where other cities try to turn them out said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California s Energy Institute Borenstein noted that Los Angeles the states largest city had long been in the public power business So has Sacramento and a number of smaller cities such as Alameda and Palo Alto PGE serves million customers in the state If youre looking at a major movement San Francisco is the biggest location where this is being discussed now Borenstein said yesterday San Diego and San Jose also have been looking at putting their electrical system under public control but have yet to take action In San Francisco two measures on the ballot would pave the way for a publicly owned electricity system Measure I would set up an independent municipal utility district for San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane governed by state law Proposition F would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and retain ties to City Hall In both cases elected directors would decide whether to seize PGEs transmission and distribution lines PGE has said it isnt interested in selling and for decades has fought at City Hall and in court to derail such efforts in San Francisco But last winters energy crisis shifted public attitudes and a more liberal Board of Supervisors pushed the public power proposals forward Still PGE vigorously opposes the effort Campaign finance reports show PGE spent through Oct to defeat the measures How much more money the company has poured into the campaign since then will not be made public until after the election Other business interests gave nearly more through Oct to fight the ballot measures The contributors include Pacific Telesis Group and ATT The companies fear the creation of a MUD would lead the new agencys directors to try to take over the phone and communications operations too The Committee on Jobs a big business group funded in part by PGE gave The money has paid for campaign consultants mailers slate cards polls phone banks and TV ads PGE spokeswoman Jennifer Ramp said the spending was warranted Its perfectly natural that any company bankrupt or not facing a hostile takeover would fight the measures and get the word out to people that this is not going to solve the energy crisis Ramp said She added the money used in the campaign did not come from the utility but from its corporate parent company Ross Mirkarimi who runs the public power campaigns was more blunt in his assessment of PGEs campaign contributions They are going to do everything they can to preserve their monopoly and greed he said The campaigns in favor of Proposition F and Measure I raised a little more than through Oct Bay Guardian newspaper publisher Bruce Brugmann and his wife Jean gave The weekly paper which has long crusaded for public power provided an additional in free advertising The Vanguard Public Foundation donated another

Electric Cos financial recovery plan is barreling toward approval with no one to speak for the public San Francisco and other counties will ask a bankruptcy judge today to grant them powers as a separate creditors committee The only committee now representing PGEs thousands of creditors is dominated by energy traders with no incentive to stand up for communities PGE serves according to a motion being filed today by San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne She hopes to win approval for a committee of government creditors to draw up an alternative restructuring of PGE Joining San Francisco in the request to bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali are Alameda Sonoma San Luis Obispo and Siskiyou counties along with the cities of Berkeley and San Jose Rennes office claims PGE has negotiated a reorganization plan that favors energy companies whose soaring wholesale electricity rates drove the utility into Bankruptcy Court Under the plan unveiled Sept PGE would drop legal challenges against the prices charged by generators who would receive full payment of about billion In return the cities and counties say the energy companies will not challenge the past transfer of billion from the regulated utility to its holding company PGE Corp nor try to block the unregulated parent company from taking ownership of the utilitys power plants transmission lines and natural gas pipelines The member creditors committee endorsed the PGE plan two weeks after it was filed Rennes office says the committee which includes seven energy trading companies including Enron and Dynegy has kept the majority of PGEs creditors in the dark Attorneys for the committee could not be reached for comment PGE spokesman Ron Low said the utility would oppose formation of a new committee The existing creditors committee represents the interests of all creditors he said The reorganization plan would pay all creditors in full Low added In May Montali refused to allow a committee of PGE customers to represent consumers interests in the bankruptcy proceedings But San Francisco and other cities and counties already have standing in the case as creditors who are owed an array of payments for taxes franchise fees and other debts If Montali authorizes a new committee of government creditors the panel could hire experts at PGEs expense and gain access to PGE financial filings With those resources Rennes office would draw up an alternative financial recovery plan for PGE and submit it to the judge Gary Cohen general counsel for the state Public Utilities Commission agreed with Renne that PGE had made a pact with the devil by agreeing to accept generators power prices But rather than drawing up a competing plan he said the PUC may try to block PGEs plan through legal challenges US Energy Regulators To Meet With Western Governors Fri WASHINGTON Dow Jones Federal energy regulators will meet with Western governors state regulators and energy industry officials in Seattle Wash on Friday to discuss the adequacy of the regions energy infrastructure to meet rising demand The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission technical conference will feature the governors of Washington and Arizona as well as state regulators from California Montana and Wyoming The agenda also features remarks by utility executives and financial analysts The intent is to identify the adequacy of current energy infrastructure and its implications for the future economic development of the region in light of the anticipated growth in population and energy demand in the West FERC said in a notice issued Tuesday outlining the conference agenda In making this assessment the goal is to achieve a better understanding of what the infrastructure needs are for the region in the near term whether the necessary construction is occurring and if not what factors are inhibiting adequate investment in infrastructure development the notice continued Concrete actions that can be undertaken by the federal and state government decisionmakers will be discussed The aim is to enhance energy infrastructure development to support wellfunctioning wholesale energy markets In preparation for the conference which piggybacks on a meeting of the Western Governors Association FERC last week received briefings on a staff assessment of the regions energy infrastructure The staff assessment found the state regions electricity reserve margin was nearly in the early s but has slipped to since then With projections for new power plants coming on line that level is expected to increase to during the next two years according to the staff assessment The assessment projected reserve margins could improve to by But the FERC staff said that is probably an overly optimistic assessment Efforts to project reserve margins more than two years in the future are unreliable they said Three states California Washington and Arizona provide nearly of the regions million megawatts of net generation capacity the staff reported From through electricity produced from natural gas increased a whopping in the region while hydropower capacity decreased and other forms of generation increased only the FERC staff reported Overall installed generation capacity changed very little because the increase in gasfired generation picked up the slack from the decrease in hydropower the staff found The report noted a US Geological Survey assessment that the Western US has proven and potential natural gas reserves adequate to meet the regions demand for the next years

Interactive October State loses million in power plays ploys It sold some energy for loss gave some away Sacramento California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least million in power trading losses The state Department of Water Resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold megawatt hours of electricity during the threemonth period ending in June That represents about percent of the total traded during that period Included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all On May the state sold megawatt hours of power for cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The state paid an average of a megawatt hour during May Two days later the state gave away megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility We may not have had a buyer said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Its not a storable product Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesnt need it Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March when million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about minutes Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fastchanging the electricity supplyanddemand situation was during the height of the energy crisis State officials say it is normal for any energybuying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally Turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly powerbuying costs But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at abovemarket rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business I suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the Department of Water Resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen Two propositions on SF ballot If San Francisco voters decide Nov that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than PGE it will be some time before the switch is flipped Propositions F and I which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures There is also uncertainty about the costs Neither measure has a price tag attached For more than two decades in San Francisco PGE has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voterbacked initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system The move gained steam with the state energy crisis If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov they will join more than public jurisdictions including Sacramento Los Angeles and Seattle that provide electric power to about million customers accounting for percent of the demand in the United States Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district or MUD in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors Measurebackers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district The directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PGE and the San Franciscoowned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency The other measure Proposition F would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the mayorappointed Public Utilities Commission The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses Like the MUD called for in Proposition I the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power Then with the consent of the Board of Supervisors the agency could take over PGEs electricity system No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under million without approval by supervisors or voters Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum The Prop F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy Props F and I both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power If both measures pass Prop I will take priority Supervisors placed Prop F on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PGE The utility waged a year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento and eventually lost Opponents of the SF public power effort with PGE at the lead already have spent more than on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks ATT and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco as well Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PGEs distribution system at million Other estimates have ranged from million to billion A lot of people are not happy with PGE But neither of these measures can guarantee that theyre going to solve the states power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said Jim Mathias vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce The unknown could be worse Proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders Historically such public power systems have had lower rates The only unknowns are ephemeral because weve seen through the Sacramento MUD the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power advocate THE MUD MEASURES San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov ballot PROPOSITION F Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors the measure would Abolish San Franciscos Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system which is now operated by the city PUC Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Cos control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses It also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local PUC has Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters Any bond issue of more than million would be subject to referendum Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall For example the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PGEs distribution lines and generation facilities PROPOSITION I Placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane The district would be run by an elected fivemember board of directors Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov ballot Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PGEs electrical and distribution system in San Francisco as well as the Hetch Hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers Requires a feasibility study of such an action Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts Give the MUD power as a state agency independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds Power plant assessment to be taken over by state Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year The delay until Jan is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan Under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg which has been fighting the plan The city which has two new power plants expected million in property tax revenue With the changes that will be reduced to just said John Knox an attorney hired by the city Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community Youll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board There will be an even bigger energy crisis He said the move will have a devastating effect on the citys redevelopment agency Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation CALGARY Dow Jones The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a twoyear moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coalfired generation plants Loosening Ontario Power Generations hold on the bulk of the provinces power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May after three delays in as many years Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives said John Dalton director at Navigant Consulting Inc in Toronto The utility has five coalfired power plants including the megawatt Naticoke and MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels Right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we dont have a power market we have a regulatory scheme Dalton said Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its antipollution regulations The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuelburning generation stations starting Jan and will be fully implemented by Under the governments plan for deregulation OPG must sell or lease about MW of nonnuclear power within months of market opening The utility owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market OPG spokesman John Earl said This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring Were working on being ready for March an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down Thats what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPGs aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesnt make them that attractive to buyers Dalton said Lakeview operates about of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleanerburning natural gas plants Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates FERC to give states a role in RTO formation WASHINGTON Oct Reuters US federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees the countrys power grid operators has ordered utilities in the Southeast Northeast Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations RTOs by the end of the year The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rulemaking process STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies Citing states confusion about FERCs direction and inconsistent internal agency communication Brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation The request was made by David Svanda commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERCs workshop on RTOs last week The move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to cogovern the process with them FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting Wood previously headed Texas state utility regulatory agency Of state commissions Wood said they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table not just standing at the door taking tickets COSTBENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED FERC also promised to prepare a formal costbenefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits The agency did not say when the study would be completed On Tuesday the New York Independent System Operator ISO released its own costbenefit study which asserted the creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer power bills by some million a year The nonprofit New York ISO would also be put out of business by a regional forprofit RTO However a separate study issued last month by energy firm Mirant Corp a supporter of RTOs concluded that a Northeastern RTO would save consumers million annually At the meeting FERC commissioners heard staff presentations on RTO development progress in the Southeast Northeast and Midwest But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC will take in guiding utilities Wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on Nov just a month ahead of FERCs Dec deadline for RTO membership Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers

Interactive October FERC extends price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON Oct Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April for the price cap which first went into effect in July of last year However FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time Therefore FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running We believe that our decision will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets which will increase supply improve reliability and lower energy prices the agency said in its order The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions The price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices The cap is supported by several large utilities such as Consolidated Edison Inc which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers However some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers USING scare and bully tactics the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid The efficient stable economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York Marylands carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years Challenges by Maryland Virginia and Washington to the federal agencys mandate have been ignored So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire Curiously FERC cited the PJM network which includes Maryland as a model for the nation Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems Warning of California type energy problems for the rest of the nation FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better It ignores the fact that California is the largest US electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them Even within PJM which serves five states and Washington members hold differing positions on forming megaregional networks But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its million customers well Theres little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of a megawatthour the agency said Wednesday The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov Gray Davis the department said In a press release the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division its powermarketing arm said it resold megawatthours or of its total purchases That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts not the longterm contracts the department said Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways the department said The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts or about onethird of the total According to the DWR power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply Shortterm deals such as monthly or quarterly contracts represent onethird of the portfolio The rest is bought in the spot market The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and cents per kilowatthour for the next five years Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices Similarly the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position the department said The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric

Interactive October WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization Dow Jones Interactive October Calif seen facing next power crunch in May LOS ANGELES Oct Reuters California looks to have sufficient power supplies to get through the winter without blackouts with its next supply challenge likely to occur next May according to a report issued by the California Independent System Operator CAISO on Monday Based on currently available data with the possible exception of May the CAISO anticipates sufficient capacity margins throughout the winter season the agency which controls most of the states power grid said in its winter assessment report The report which covered October through May projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up Operating margins for May are slim with the current level of planned outages However the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month the report noted The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May can be avoided the report said An additional megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of During an additional MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May period the report said Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering In December for example a peak load of MW was projected versus an average of MW ISO figures show Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time the report said California hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market endured the years sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May The lights stayed on throughout the summer when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts Texas Ready For Jan Start For Deregulation Official CHICAGO Dow Jones Texas will be ready to implement fullscale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year despite challenges from critics the top official at the states powergrid operator said Monday We believe that weve come a long way said Tom Noel chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the states Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay A pilot program for of Texas investorowned utility customers has been in effect since late July and it started after a nearly twomonth delay linked to system glitches The consumer groups including AARP and Consumers Union the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers among other issues It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional the groups said in comments filed with the PSC But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan deadline So far of customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched and the others are moving through the planned day switching process he said There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August caused by system malfunctions but those have mostly been resolved he said Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November Noel said Noel also said Ercots settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state The markets working very well Noel said What we have is a data problem Ercots systems are designed to handle about customer switches a day So far the system has received and processed a peak volume of between and switches Noel said By Jon Kamp Dow Jones Newswires Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter Report LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California may be able to chill out a bit this winter New power plants and continued conservation should give the state enough of a margin to head off the soaring prices and rolling blackouts that plagued it a year ago according to a forecast released last week by the states power grid operator In general it looks like a pretty good forecast through the winter months into said Gregg Fishman spokesman for the California Independent System Operator Last winter California experienced an unprecedented electricity shortage that resulted in more than days of power emergencies and scattered rolling blackouts The situation was partly due to the deteriorating financial condition of the states two largest utilities high prices of natural gas and maintenance outages This winter however the state should have an adequate supply of electricity due in part to new generation coming online and a statewide conservation effort Powerplant maintenance will be minimal during the winter season compared with last year and new power plants operating since Sept will produce megawatts in new supply according to the ISO report The ISO charged with keeping power supply and demand in balance on the grid and operating the states spot electricity market expects demand for power to peak at megawatts in October and about megawatts from November through May That would leave operating reserves of between and megawatts roughly a reserve margin the minimum amount required by the Western Systems Coordinating Council which maintains grid reliability throughout the West The ISO said the reserve margin is enough to avert the disaster the state experienced last winter according to the report In addition the ISO expects there will be enough natural gas in storage to meet demand Last winter the price of natural gas skyrocketed to a million British thermal unit Currently the average price of natural gas is about MMBtu Naturalgas storage is looking very very strong Fishman said Theres far more in storage and available in general than we saw last year at this same time The ISO doesnt know whether generators have firm fuel contracts in place to cover demand But the grid operator doesnt expect limits on gas supplies to hurt its ability to keep the lights on according to the report The ISO forecast assumes Californians will continue to conserve about of their electrical consumption Fishman said The state also relies heavily on imports from the Pacific Northwest in order to get through without any power emergencies or rolling blackouts The state expects to import about MW this winter As a result the ISO forecast could change in the coming months if the state is unable to import power Currently the forecast for the Pacific Northwest calls for a wet winter in the Northwest according to the National Weather Service Jerry Rust president of the Northwest Power Pool told Dow Jones Newswires the region expects to cover peak demand this winter The agency is currently preparing its own report he added New generation upgrades in northern California will help minimize congestion on the transmission link known as Path the key northsouth interconnection although bottlenecks could still occur according to the report Depending on actual Pacific Northwest import levels and Northern California hydro levels potential overloads on Path could occur again this winter as a result of southtonorth power transfers according to the report Some areas of northern California particularly Humboldt County and the Bay Area could encounter some difficulties if local generation isnt available due to power plant maintenance or breakdowns For the ISO said there are new power plant projects totaling megawatts that are in different phases of hooking up to the grid but its unclear how much of that capacity will be added before May according to the report CPUC Approves Transmission Project SAN FRANCISCO California The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC last week approved a transmission project to increase capacity to several cities in the San Francisco metropolitan area that will be built by Pacific Gas Electric PGE The kilovolt transmission line would serve the cities of Dublin Pleasanton Livermore San Ramon and unincorporated areas of Alameda and Contra Costa counties The CPUC placed a cap of million on the project costs for the mile line As a condition for approval the CPUC also required PGE to remove an existing kilovolt line WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization TUCSON ArizBUSINESS WIREOct A broad group of electric transmission line owners in the Southwest has taken initial steps to form WestConnect a forprofit regional transmission organization RTO Founding members believe WestConnect will form the framework for an RTO for the entire Western United States Agreements and operating protocols for the RTO were filed today with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC by Arizona Public Service Co El Paso Electric Co Public Service Co of New Mexico and Tucson Electric Power Co each of which is subject to FERC oversight These utilities along with Salt River Project in Arizona have agreed to fund startup of WestConnect operations which are projected to begin in Other utilities in the Desert Southwest and adjoining areas have been actively involved in the process and are expected to continue to be involved as WestConnect gets underway FERC has proposed RTOs to facilitate development and operation of transmission on a regional basis WestConnect will strengthen reliability for customers and ease the transfer of electricity between regions It will do so by focusing on transmission line reliability nondiscriminatory open access to use of the lines support for a robust wholesale market and governance that is independent of market participants WestConnect evolved from an earlier Southwestern RTO development project named DesertSTAR and it has used the operating protocols developed by DesertSTAR stakeholders through extensive negotiations during the last four years DesertSTAR Chairman of the Board Jack King said WestConnect is a logical step I am encouraged by the actions of the WestConnect members in building upon the work of DesertSTAR to move toward an RTO for the West The group turned to the forprofit governance structure in lieu of the notforprofit DesertSTAR model in response to recent FERC rulings and a desire to create a governance structure that will encourage innovation and creativity in the operation and further development of the Western transmission grid WestConnect has been structured to permit involvement by investorowned utilities cooperatives publicpower entities and federal power marketing agencies so it can transition into the RTO for the West WestConnect is working closely with other utility companies and provisional RTO projects to explore expanding WestConnects service area WestConnect utilities say they are confident their filing with FERC conforms to the regulatory agencys established organizational and operating guidelines

world that Pacific Gas and Electric Co is quietly very quietly placing its downtown San Francisco headquarters up for sale Sources tell me that PGE is looking to unload more than pieces of property throughout Northern California and the crown jewel of the offering is the utilitys headquarters building which it would then lease back under a longterm contract However PGE is trying to keep the sales below the radar by going through investment banking channels rather than listing most of the properties outright sources say Id bet theyre trying to not spook the market and get people even more worried about their situation one broker said A spokesman for the utility insisted that there are no current plans to sell the headquarters but refused to say categorically that PGE isnt pondering the idea As for other properties that may be on the block the utility hasnt updated its online portfolio of surplus assets in months so its impossible to say what may or may not be up for grabs Still the rumored plan for the headquarters is for PGE to sell off either one or both of its main headquarters buildings at Market and Beale streets in the Financial District and then lease the property back from the new owner PGE already leases part of its headquarters from Shorenstein Co for about a month Likely buyers for the other utility buildings would include Shorenstein and Sam Zells Equity Office Properties which became a serious player in the Bay Area after merging with Spieker Properties Although PGE does not publicly discuss its real estate assets internal utility documents recently placed the value of the downtown headquarters at about million before commercial office prices went into a tailspin This wouldnt make a huge dent in the roughly billion PGE owes its creditors But hey every

been approached by state officials to discuss the possibility of renegotiating billion in longterm power pacts the state entered into last spring and executives with the companies indicated they would unlikely be willing to restructure the deals The California Public Utilities Commission has urged the administration of Gov Gray Davis to renegotiate the deals saying the contracts will saddle ratepayers with expensive power for the next years In addition PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission wont pass a rate agreement needed to sell billion in bonds to pay for the power contracts until the deals are renegotiated The rate agreement between the PUC and the state Department of Water Resources will ensure there is enough of a revenue stream in the current rate structure to pay off the bonds Barry Goode legal adviser to Gov Davis said last week the state has no intention of opening up talks with generators to restructure the contracts The PUC filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that oversees the wholesale price of power saying the price of electricity in the contracts which average about a megawatthour for the first five years are not just and reasonable All of the energy companies have defended the contracts saying the prices were based on natural gas futures and the market price for wholesale electricity However the price for power sharply declined shortly after the contracts were signed for which Davis and Calpine Corp CPN Senior Vice President of Power Marketing Jim Macias credit the deals Calpine a San Josebased company which holds the bulk of the billion in longterm pacts hasnt been asked to restructure the contracts Macias said He said many of the contracts are tied to the construction of new power plants and if the deals were changed the company could lose its financing and the facilities wouldnt get built We dont think our contracts will be renegotiated Macias said Its very difficult to see even how this would be renegotiated We made a commitment to deliver the power and the state made a commitment to pay for it If either party fails to perform there is a provision in the contract that says you have to make the other party whole Macias said it wasnt impossible to restructure the contracts but that it would be very difficult to unwind the position Other Suppliers Say Financing Tied To LongTerm Deals Tom Murnane a spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Energy SRE also signed a multibillion longterm contract with the state He too said the company hasnt been approached by state officials to renegotiate the contracts Were building a fleet of power plants based on these contracts said Murnane In order to secure lending we had to show banks that we had this deal Would the state allow us to renegotiate if power prices increase The only legal recourse for renegotiation Murnane said would be if both parties agreed to change the terms of the contracts But then where do you stop Murnane said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy Inc DYN said the company has no obligation to renegotiate the longterm deal his company signed with California just because the price for power has declined recently We have a legally binding agreement and therefore we dont have any obligation to renegotiate the contract Stengel said However we could choose to if it was mutually beneficial to both parties A spokeswoman for the FERC said the PUC complaint has been received but the agency wouldnt comment further Macias said the PUC would have a very difficult challenge convincing FERC that these contracts were not reasonably priced when the were entered into Its a high hurdle to demonstrate that FERC needs to step in and void these contracts especially if the people who entered into them believe these contracts helped stabilize the market Macias said Distributive Generation Helps Providers Transmitters Distributors Consumers with Cost Reduction and Reliability in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREOct The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston Texas Distributive generation is the use of small electric generators used to help meet peak power demands during times of high usage on the electrical grid These small generators are found in many varied sources including fuel cells batteries turbinegenerators combustion wind waste heat steam micro and reciprocating enginegenerators Consumers as well as those who provide transmit and distribute electricity have found that having these small generators in key areas can help when there is a shortage or other problem with the grid Many government and service organizations such as police fire and hospitals and large energy consumers such as factories mills and plants have had emergency generation for a long time With electrical deregulation here and the spot market having such high peaks others have found it cheaper and more convenient as well Several utilities throughout the Midwest and Western states have taken to renting or purchasing many small generators or more and installing them at substations and at major customers sites to prevent problems during electrical shortages and outages As consumers become more and more reliant on automation and computers the need for reliable power will increase and the need for distributive power will continue to grow as well The day may come when distributive power could account for as much as of all power Industrialinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial

Andre W Lewis whose fathers first cousin is Powell and who considers the prominent leader his uncle has been hired as deputy political director of the Davis reelection committee Davis campaign adviser Garry South said the governor did not know of Lewis connection to Powell until after he was hired Thats not why we hired him South said I just thought he was a highclass highquality guy and that he would be a real addition to the staff South said Raised in Southern California Lewis has worked in politics at the national state and local levels According to the campaign committee Lewis has served as chief of staff for US Rep Juanita MillenderMcDonald DCarson since He also has worked for the California Democratic Party and served two stints in the US State Department as a presidential appointee in the Clinton administration At the State Department he worked as a senior official on European and Central Asian security issues and was a special envoy to the hostage negotiations during the Kosovo

the winner of a March Republican primary Gov Davis campaign is fined The Fair Political Practices Commission fined Gov Gray Davis campaign committee yesterday for campaign reporting violations during his gubernatorial election The commission found that Davis campaign failed to properly report nearly in contributions It also said Davis committee did not properly itemize about in donations While the money was listed in voluntary electronic filings it was not properly reported on paper copies the FPPC said Campaign officials also did not itemize more than million paid to consultants to buy television campaign spots The campaign also failed to show proof that it told major contributors that they had to file separate donation disclosures A spokesman for Davis committee Gabriel Sanchez said the campaign did not intentional violate campaign laws We make every effort to follow the letter of the law but in any campaign this large there are glitches Sanchez said While it is regrettable this is a small amount of infractions given the amount of money spent in the campaign Alternative SDGE debt plan to get hearings Approval of the governors plan for paying the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about million more than the governors proposal The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas Electric At stake is how much SDGE contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt which accumulated in a socalled balancing account when SDGE paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis Despite the plan for hearings Lynch told KPBSFM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial million debt by November The governor and SDGE announced their plan in June saying it required the utility to contribute million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates Consumer groups led by the San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network say the governors plan does not go far enough particularly because SDGE earned an estimated million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis Under the governors plan those profits are awarded to the companys shareholders though SDGE would use million from the profits as part of its million contribution toward the debt Under the consumer groups plan SDGE would be allowed to keep some of the profits but it would contribute million more than it would under the governors plan The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions In a formal decision earlier this year the California utilities commission said SDGEs profits do belong to customers SDGE has sued to overturn the decision in court but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commissions resolution of the plan to pay the debt Michael Shames executive director of UCAN said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynchs call for hearings on the consumer plan There is million at stake here Shames said SDGE said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt A spokesman for the utility however repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUCs process of considering the governors plan Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than billion in longterm electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be just and reasonable The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets she said If you have to pay three to four times more for energy you dont have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family Lynch said She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds which would separate them from the longterm power contracts Edison pact could point way for PGE The multibilliondollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC one likelier to strike closeddoor deals without its typical months of testimony briefs and hearings Along with its statewide impacts which may not fully unfold for years the settlement with the states secondlargest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers who will pay billions to retire its debts One week after a federal judge approved the billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers From the start the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement It was negotiated in secret approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved Its definitely ambiguously worded said Steve Linsey a supervisor in the PUCs semiindependent Office of Ratepayer Advocates On his first review of the deal he thought about billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates But that figure will be at least billion and probably higher according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC There seems to be a lot of offthebooks interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers Linsey said The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers In addition the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edisons finances sweeping in old debts and cash on hand and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off billion in debts About threefourths of that amount billion appears to come from the utilitys customers Edisons investors will pick up billion billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years and million as a company contribution The clearestcut customer contribution flows into a billion pot to be filled by future electric bills probably through the end of But thats not their only contribution Another billion would come from Edisons cash on hand which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers In the end youre right the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers said Brian Bennett Edison vice president of external affairs But if Edison had won its suit Bennett said it would have been entitled to the full billion without its shareholders taking any hit at all No one can know who would have won the Edison suit Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments So why did the PUC after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail chose to settle Partly the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas But he and others said there was another looming fear The PGE bankruptcy reorganization plan filed Sept called for shifting utility assets including the companys hydroelectric plants nuclear plant and gas storage and pipeline network to a firm free from state regulation Peoples calculus was shaken up by what PGE did said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group It was just in the ether that oh God theres something really ugly out there We dont think they can get away with it but were not entirely sure The reorganization plan would leave a new PGE company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PGE and Edison They plan to fight PGEs efforts and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated They could say judge you dont have to do this bad deal that PGE wants We can work it out said Randy Chinn an adviser to state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey For its part PGE maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal But now the utility said it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utilitys efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge PGE will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution I think it would be smarter to be talking now he said A PGE rescue wouldnt follow the Edison settlement exactly because PGEs debts and costs are higher Cohen said but the PUCs goal would be the same goal it held for Edison a healthy regulated utility Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late s to position itself for deregulation A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year until the Edison settlement We finally got to the point where we said look weve seen the alternatives and the alternatives are something like what PGE is trying to do or having the state take over the business of buying power Cohen said Most people at the commission he said concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying power for cashstrapped utilities since January Cohen who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing Bilas said if it had leaked so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed At a closed session before approving it he said every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process full information and proper hearings It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow Bilas Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them But the fivemember commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner It scares the hell out of me what a really proutility commission would do with this said Florio the consumer advocate This could be the beginning of something really ugly In addition if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through timeconsuming PUC procedures a flurry of suits could follow said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates Office Groups file plan for SDGE debt Consumer groups and others filed an alternative plan with the California Public Utilities Commission yesterday for dealing with the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers The groups say their proposal will save ratepayers at least million compared with an earlier proposal submitted to the PUC by the utility and state officials Separately the commission ordered San Diego Gas Electric to apply all of an expected million in savings from an earlier corporate merger to customers during SDGE had asked to retain half the savings for shareholders

Enron Corp ENE and Dynegy Inc DYN according to energy markets lore these days After all the logic goes there will be two of everyone Enron traders arent so sure of that as energy firms can attest In the past days the number of resumes from Enron personnel has increased substantially said William Begley head of the energy and utilities practice at Heidrick Struggles HSII an executive recruiting firm in Houston Resumes are coming from all units at Enron but the number of those from traders has grown significantly during the period he added Other recruiting firms said that Enron traders have become more receptive to unsolicitied headhunting calls lately No one knows for sure how jobs will shake out at Enron as the company goes through hard times and faces a merger with Dynegy Recruiters and Enron employees are mixed over how much actual fallout there will be One thing they agree on though is that if Enron traders do leave they arent guaranteed to find new jobs quickly despite their credentials which are regarded as sterling in the energy industry If energy markets contract as a result of Enrons troubles the job market for traders could flood Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap currently valued at billion The companies confirmed the deal late last week Shares in both companies rose in heavy trading Monday as investors weighed the planned deal Some uncertainty remains around the fate of the merger partly because of the numerous regulatory hurdles it faces Enron still the largest energy trading company in the world has suffered a massive setback in the past month Four weeks ago a billion reduction of shareholder equity kicked off a slide in the companys share price and prompted a US Securities and Exchange Commission investigation Recruiters started seeing more resumes from Enron before the companys troubles came to a head As early as this summer when former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling left the company employees at the companys noncore units have been looking for jobs recruiters said Electricity and natural gas traders at Enron have long been considered some of the smartest participants in US energy markets The company is a market maker in both gas and electricity meaning that its prices for both commodities are benchmarks for traders throughout the markets Enron led the effort to deregulate US power markets and has been one of the most vocal lobbyists for deregulation at the state and federal levels over the years Because Enron is such a large counterparty in the energy trading sector all of its trading partners everyone is hoping the thing gets resolved said Bruce Peterson managing director at KornFerry Intl KFY in Houston an executive search company The whole industry is definitely affected by what has happened at Enron Until its sorted out you have a tremendous amount of uneasiness It needs to get resolved It will be essential for Dynegy to keep some of the core leadership from Enron analysts say By retaining the best Dynegy should be able to secure other strong Enron employees In our view Enrons energy trading and marketing personnel are arguably the most talented and definitely the most profitable group in the industry Prudential Securities analyst M Carol Coale said in a research note Monday We believe that Dynegy must focus on retaining these valuable traders and marketers if the new company is to realize its full potential in the wholesale segment Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley who will be at Dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president said in a conference call on Monday that he believes the new company will retain its traders Most traders want to be part of the winning team he said Some recruiters believe that although many Enron employees are floating resumes there wont be much actual fallout Enrons trading operation employs between and people in North America Dynegys operation is staffed by But with a few trimmings here and there you wont see a lot of Enron traders on the street unless they dont like what they hear from Dynegy said Jack Carr managing director of Prime Energy Partnership a search and recruiting company based in the UK with an office in Greenwich Connecticut An experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn plus a bonus according to Carr Right now Enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused according to one trader at another company who wouldnt allow his name to be used I think theyre very nervous the trader said The Enron people think theyre better than the Dynegy people and the Dynegy people think were buying them so we can just pick through their stuff Media to get access to state power pacts A coalition of news organizations settled with the governors office on the only remaining issue in a lawsuit seeking access to the states contracts with power generators The settlement will require the state to release shortterm and spotmarket energy contracts within days of the end of each contract period Its not as soon as we wanted but its not the lengthy delay the governor wanted Its somewhere in between said Alonzo Wickers the attorney for the news organizations Spotmarket contracts are agreements for days or less and shortterm contracts last days to a year The legal battle began in February when a handful of news organizations including The San Diego UnionTribune sued Gov Gray Davis to get information about the contracts under the California Public Records Act Davis spokesman could not be reached for comment yesterday In June a Superior Court judge ordered the state to release its longterm contracts which revealed that the contracts the governor negotiated had bound the state to huge electricity costs through the end of the decade All the selfcongratulatory proclamations from the governors office about how beneficial these contracts were for the state of California didnt pan out Wickers said It certainly seems the public had a right to know State energy spending plunges Water official trumpets decline as cost control Sacramento The states spending on energy plummeted in October to its lowest level this year according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Water Resources California spent million on power purchases in October half of what it spent in August and million less than in September Since January the state has been purchasing power for the three investor owned utilities At the markets peak the cost of power was an average of million a day Octobers average was million a day These steep declines in our overall power expenses are an obvious signal that California has accomplished the task of controlling what were once runaway costs in the spot market said Pete Garris acting deputy director of the Department of Water Resources which is in charge of buying the states power Each month since May California has been able to slash hundreds of millions of dollars off its costs Garris said These overall costs are a good measure of how successful weve been in lowering the price of energy However the department said it did not have figures for how much power the state sold last month Without those numbers consumer advocates say it is impossible to know how well the state is doing We need to know the entire picture said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network If we bought too much and are selling it at a loss we need to know that Hoge said this is especially important as the state begins to try to renegotiate longterm power contracts Gov Gray Davis and his administration began negotiating and signing long term contracts during the height of the energy crisis Davis and others say the contracts helped drive down the price of power but critics say the state locked in too much power at too high a price For the three months ending in June the state sold about million worth of power at times even giving electricity away We may need to take a broader look at the contracts Hoge said The downturn in natural gas prices has made a huge difference Thats because much of the electricity on the market is produced by plants that run on natural gas Although the Davis administration has said it is open to renegotiating the contracts it has made no progress thus far A spokesman for the department said numbers detailing how much power the state has sold will be available later this month

Andre W Lewis whose fathers first cousin is Powell and who considers the prominent leader his uncle has been hired as deputy political director of the Davis reelection committee Davis campaign adviser Garry South said the governor did not know of Lewis connection to Powell until after he was hired Thats not why we hired him South said I just thought he was a highclass highquality guy and that he would be a real addition to the staff South said Raised in Southern California Lewis has worked in politics at the national state and local levels According to the campaign committee Lewis has served as chief of staff for US Rep Juanita MillenderMcDonald DCarson since He also has worked for the California Democratic Party and served two stints in the US State Department as a presidential appointee in the Clinton administration At the State Department he worked as a senior official on European and Central Asian security issues and was a special envoy to the hostage negotiations during the Kosovo war the committee said Lewis who is working at Davis Los Angeles campaign headquarters declined to comment and the campaign referred questions to South Lewis will help with political operations and outreach to the states AfricanAmerican community public safety and veterans groups according to a press release issued by the campaign Lewis a Democrat occasionally talks in the office about Powell and the US response to the Sept terrorist attacks South said He doesnt wear it on his sleeve but hes obviously proud of him South said Davis is seeking a second term in office In November he will face the winner of a March Republican primary Gov Davis campaign is fined The Fair Political Practices Commission fined Gov Gray Davis campaign committee yesterday for campaign reporting violations during his gubernatorial election The commission found that Davis campaign failed to properly report nearly in contributions It also said Davis committee did not properly itemize about in donations While the money was listed in voluntary electronic filings it was not properly reported on paper copies the FPPC said Campaign officials also did not itemize more than million paid to consultants to buy television campaign spots The campaign also failed to show proof that it told major contributors that they had to file separate donation disclosures A spokesman for Davis committee Gabriel Sanchez said the campaign did not intentional violate campaign laws We make every effort to follow the letter of the law but in any campaign this large there are glitches Sanchez said While it is regrettable this is a small amount of infractions given the amount of money spent in the campaign Alternative SDGE debt plan to get hearings Approval of the governors plan for paying the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about million more than the governors proposal The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas Electric At stake is how much SDGE contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt which accumulated in a socalled balancing account when SDGE paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis Despite the plan for hearings Lynch told KPBSFM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial million debt by November The governor and SDGE announced their plan in June saying it required the utility to contribute million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates Consumer groups led by the San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network say the governors plan does not go far enough particularly because SDGE earned an estimated million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis Under the governors plan those profits are awarded to the companys shareholders though SDGE would use million from the profits as part of its million contribution toward the debt Under the consumer groups plan SDGE would be allowed to keep some of the profits but it would contribute million more than it would under the governors plan The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions In a formal decision earlier this year the California utilities commission said SDGEs profits do belong to customers SDGE has sued to overturn the decision in court but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commissions resolution of the plan to pay the debt Michael Shames executive director of UCAN said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynchs call for hearings on the consumer plan There is million at stake here Shames said SDGE said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt A spokesman for the utility however repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUCs process of considering the governors plan Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than billion in longterm electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be just and reasonable The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets she said If you have to pay three to four times more for energy you dont have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family Lynch said She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds which would separate them from the longterm power contracts Edison pact could point way for PGE The multibilliondollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC one likelier to strike closeddoor deals without its typical months of testimony briefs and hearings Along with its statewide impacts which may not fully unfold for years the settlement with the states secondlargest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers who will pay billions to retire its debts One week after a federal judge approved the billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers From the start the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement It was negotiated in secret approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved Its definitely ambiguously worded said Steve Linsey a supervisor in the PUCs semiindependent Office of Ratepayer Advocates On his first review of the deal he thought about billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates But that figure will be at least billion and probably higher according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC There seems to be a lot of offthebooks interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers Linsey said The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers In addition the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edisons finances sweeping in old debts and cash on hand and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off billion in debts About threefourths of that amount billion appears to come from the utilitys customers Edisons investors will pick up billion billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years and million as a company contribution The clearestcut customer contribution flows into a billion pot to be filled by future electric bills probably through the end of But thats not their only contribution Another billion would come from Edisons cash on hand which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers In the end youre right the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers said Brian Bennett Edison vice president of external affairs But if Edison had won its suit Bennett said it would have been entitled to the full billion without its shareholders taking any hit at all No one can know who would have won the Edison suit Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments So why did the PUC after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail chose to settle Partly the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas But he and others said there was another looming fear The PGE bankruptcy reorganization plan filed Sept called for shifting utility assets including the companys hydroelectric plants nuclear plant and gas storage and pipeline network to a firm free from state regulation Peoples calculus was shaken up by what PGE did said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group It was just in the ether that oh God theres something really ugly out there We dont think they can get away with it but were not entirely sure The reorganization plan would leave a new PGE company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PGE and Edison They plan to fight PGEs efforts and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated They could say judge you dont have to do this bad deal that PGE wants We can work it out said Randy Chinn an adviser to state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey For its part PGE maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal But now the utility said it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utilitys efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge PGE will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution I think it would be smarter to be talking now he said A PGE rescue wouldnt follow the Edison settlement exactly because PGEs debts and costs are higher Cohen said but the PUCs goal would be the same goal it held for Edison a healthy regulated utility Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late s to position itself for deregulation A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year until the Edison settlement We finally got to the point where we said look weve seen the alternatives and the alternatives are something like what PGE is trying to do or having the state take over the business of buying power Cohen said Most people at the commission he said concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying power for cashstrapped

Public Utilities Commission yesterday for dealing with the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers The groups say their proposal will save ratepayers at least million compared with an earlier proposal submitted to the PUC by the utility and state officials Separately the commission ordered San Diego Gas Electric to apply all of an expected million in savings from an earlier corporate merger to customers during SDGE had asked to retain half the savings for shareholders

Advisory by Industrialinfocom Dow Jones Interactive October PGEs real estate rumors I sure hate to kick a bankrupt utility when its down but what are all these rumors floating around the commercial real estate world that Pacific Gas and Electric Co is quietly very quietly placing its downtown San Francisco headquarters up for sale Sources tell me that PGE is looking to unload more than pieces of property throughout Northern California and the crown jewel of the offering is the utilitys headquarters building which it would then lease back under a longterm contract However PGE is trying to keep the sales below the radar by going through investment banking channels rather than listing most of the properties outright sources say Id bet theyre trying to not spook the market and get people even more worried about their situation one broker said A spokesman for the utility insisted that there are no current plans to sell the headquarters but refused to say categorically that PGE isnt pondering the idea As for other properties that may be on the block the utility hasnt updated its online portfolio of surplus assets in months so its impossible to say what may or may not be up for grabs Still the rumored plan for the headquarters is for PGE to sell off either one or both of its main headquarters buildings at Market and Beale streets in the Financial District and then lease the property back from the new owner PGE already leases part of its headquarters from Shorenstein Co for about a month Likely buyers for the other utility buildings would include Shorenstein and Sam Zells Equity Office Properties which became a serious player in the Bay Area after merging with Spieker Properties Although PGE does not publicly discuss its real estate assets internal utility documents recently placed the value of the downtown headquarters at about million before commercial office prices went into a tailspin This wouldnt make a huge dent in the roughly billion PGE owes its creditors

been approached by state officials to discuss the possibility of renegotiating billion in longterm power pacts the state entered into last spring and executives with the companies indicated they would unlikely be willing to restructure the deals The California Public Utilities Commission has urged the administration of Gov Gray Davis to renegotiate the deals saying the contracts will saddle ratepayers with expensive power for the next years In addition PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission wont pass a rate agreement needed to sell billion in bonds to pay for the power contracts until the deals are renegotiated The rate agreement between the PUC and the state Department of Water Resources will ensure there is enough of a revenue stream in the current rate structure to pay off the bonds Barry Goode legal adviser to Gov Davis said last week the state has no intention of opening up talks with generators to restructure the contracts The PUC filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that oversees the wholesale price of power saying the price of electricity in the contracts which average about a megawatthour for the first five years are not just and reasonable All of the energy companies have defended the contracts saying the prices were based on natural gas futures and the market price for wholesale electricity However the price for power sharply declined shortly after the contracts were signed for which Davis and Calpine Corp CPN Senior Vice President of Power Marketing Jim Macias credit the deals Calpine a San Josebased company which holds the bulk of the billion in longterm pacts hasnt been asked to restructure the contracts Macias said He said many of the contracts are tied to the construction of new power plants and if the deals were changed the company could lose its financing and the facilities wouldnt get built We dont think our contracts will be renegotiated Macias said Its very difficult to see even how this would be renegotiated We made a commitment to deliver the power and the state made a commitment to pay for it If either party fails to perform there is a provision in the contract that says you have to make the other party whole Macias said it wasnt impossible to restructure the contracts but that it would be very difficult to unwind the position Other Suppliers Say Financing Tied To LongTerm Deals Tom Murnane a spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Energy SRE also signed a multibillion longterm contract with the state He too said the company hasnt been approached by state officials to renegotiate the contracts Were building a fleet of power plants based on these contracts said Murnane In order to secure lending we had to show banks that we had this deal Would the state allow us to renegotiate if power prices increase The only legal recourse for renegotiation Murnane said would be if both parties agreed to change the terms of the contracts But then where do you stop Murnane said Steve Stengel a spokesman for Dynegy Inc DYN said the company has no obligation to renegotiate the longterm deal his company signed with California just because the price for power has declined recently We have a legally binding agreement and therefore we dont have any obligation to renegotiate the contract Stengel said However we could choose to if it was mutually beneficial to both parties A spokeswoman for the FERC said the PUC complaint has been received but the agency wouldnt comment further Macias said the PUC would have a very difficult challenge convincing FERC that these contracts were not reasonably priced when the were entered into Its a high hurdle to demonstrate that FERC needs to step in and void these contracts especially if the people who entered into them believe these contracts helped stabilize the market Macias said Distributive Generation Helps Providers Transmitters Distributors Consumers with Cost Reduction and Reliability in an Advisory by Industrialinfocom HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREOct The following is an advisory by Industrialinfocom Industrial Information Resources Inc Houston Texas Distributive generation is the use of small electric generators used to help meet peak power demands during times of high usage on the electrical grid These small generators are found in many varied sources including fuel cells batteries turbinegenerators combustion wind waste heat steam micro and reciprocating enginegenerators Consumers as well as those who provide transmit and distribute electricity have found that having these small generators in key areas can help when there is a shortage or other problem with the grid Many government and service organizations such as police fire and hospitals and large energy consumers such as factories mills and plants have had emergency generation for a long time With electrical deregulation here and the spot market having such high peaks others have found it cheaper and more convenient as well Several utilities throughout the Midwest and Western states have taken to renting or purchasing many small generators or more and installing them at substations and at major customers sites to prevent problems during electrical shortages and outages As consumers become more and more reliant on automation and computers the need for reliable power will increase and the need for distributive power will continue to grow as well The day may come when distributive power could account for as much as of all power Industrialinfocom provides daily news related to the industrial

Transmission Project Dow Jones Interactive October WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization Dow Jones Interactive October Calif seen facing next power crunch in May LOS ANGELES Oct Reuters California looks to have sufficient power supplies to get through the winter without blackouts with its next supply challenge likely to occur next May according to a report issued by the California Independent System Operator CAISO on Monday Based on currently available data with the possible exception of May the CAISO anticipates sufficient capacity margins throughout the winter season the agency which controls most of the states power grid said in its winter assessment report The report which covered October through May projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up Operating margins for May are slim with the current level of planned outages However the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month the report noted The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May can be avoided the report said An additional megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of During an additional MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May period the report said Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering In December for example a peak load of MW was projected versus an average of MW ISO figures show Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time the report said California hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market endured the years sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May The lights stayed on throughout the summer when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts Texas Ready For Jan Start For Deregulation Official CHICAGO Dow Jones Texas will be ready to implement fullscale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year despite challenges from critics the top official at the states powergrid operator said Monday We believe that weve come a long way said Tom Noel chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the states Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay A pilot program for of Texas investorowned utility customers has been in effect since late July and it started after a nearly twomonth delay linked to system glitches The consumer groups including AARP and Consumers Union the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers among other issues It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional the groups said in comments filed with the PSC But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan deadline So far of customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched and the others are moving through the planned day switching process he said There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August caused by system malfunctions but those have mostly been resolved he said Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November Noel said Noel also said Ercots settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state The markets working very well Noel said What we have is a data problem Ercots systems are designed to handle about customer switches a day So far the system has received and processed a peak volume of between and switches Noel said By Jon Kamp Dow Jones Newswires Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter Report LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California may be able to chill out a bit this winter New power plants and continued conservation should give the state enough of a margin to head off the soaring prices and rolling blackouts that plagued it a year ago according to a forecast released last week by the states power grid operator In general it looks like a pretty good forecast through the winter months into said Gregg Fishman spokesman for the California Independent System Operator Last winter California experienced an unprecedented electricity shortage that resulted in more than days of power emergencies and scattered rolling blackouts The situation was partly due to the deteriorating financial condition of the states two largest utilities high prices of natural gas and maintenance outages This winter however the state should have an adequate supply of electricity due in part to new generation coming online and a statewide conservation effort Powerplant maintenance will be minimal during the winter season compared with last year and new power plants operating since Sept will produce megawatts in new supply according to the ISO report The ISO charged with keeping power supply and demand in balance on the grid and operating the states spot electricity market expects demand for power to peak at megawatts in October and about megawatts from November through May That would leave operating reserves of between and megawatts roughly a reserve margin the minimum amount required by the Western Systems Coordinating Council which maintains grid reliability throughout the West The ISO said the reserve margin is enough to avert the disaster the state experienced last winter according to the report In addition the ISO expects there will be enough natural gas in storage to meet demand Last winter the price of natural gas skyrocketed to a million British thermal unit Currently the average price of natural gas is about MMBtu Naturalgas storage is looking very very strong Fishman said Theres far more in storage and available in general than we saw last year at this same time The ISO doesnt know whether generators have firm fuel contracts in place to cover demand But the grid operator doesnt expect limits on gas supplies to hurt its ability to keep the lights on according to the report The ISO forecast assumes Californians will continue to conserve about of their electrical consumption Fishman said The state also relies heavily on imports from the Pacific Northwest in order to get through without any power emergencies or rolling blackouts The state expects to import about MW this winter As a result the ISO forecast could change in the coming months if the state is unable to import power Currently the forecast for the Pacific Northwest calls for a wet winter in the Northwest according to the National Weather Service Jerry Rust president of the Northwest Power Pool told Dow Jones Newswires the region expects to cover peak demand this winter The agency is currently preparing its own report he added New generation upgrades in northern California will help minimize congestion on the transmission link known as Path the key northsouth interconnection although bottlenecks could still occur according to the report Depending on actual Pacific Northwest import levels and Northern California hydro levels potential overloads on Path could occur again this winter as a result of southtonorth power transfers according to the report Some areas of northern California particularly Humboldt County and the Bay Area could encounter some difficulties if local generation isnt available due to power plant maintenance or breakdowns For the ISO said there are new power plant projects totaling megawatts that are in different phases of hooking up to the grid but its unclear how much of that capacity will be added before May according to the report CPUC Approves Transmission Project SAN FRANCISCO California The California Public Utilities Commission CPUC last week approved a transmission project to increase capacity to several cities in the San Francisco metropolitan area that will be built by Pacific Gas Electric PGE The kilovolt transmission line would serve the cities of Dublin Pleasanton Livermore San Ramon and unincorporated areas of Alameda and Contra Costa counties The CPUC placed a cap of million on the project costs for the mile line As a condition for approval the CPUC also required PGE to remove an existing kilovolt line WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization TUCSON ArizBUSINESS WIREOct A broad group of electric transmission line owners in the Southwest has taken initial steps to form WestConnect a forprofit regional transmission organization RTO Founding members believe WestConnect will form the framework for an RTO for the entire Western United States Agreements and operating protocols for the RTO were filed today with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC by Arizona Public Service Co El Paso Electric Co Public Service Co of New Mexico and Tucson Electric Power Co each of which is subject to FERC oversight These utilities along with Salt River Project in Arizona have agreed to fund startup of WestConnect operations which are projected to begin in Other utilities in the Desert Southwest and adjoining areas have been actively involved in the process and are expected to continue to be involved as WestConnect gets underway FERC has proposed RTOs to facilitate development and operation of transmission on a regional basis WestConnect will strengthen reliability for customers and ease the transfer of electricity between regions It will do so by focusing on transmission line reliability nondiscriminatory open access to use of the lines support for a robust wholesale market and governance that is independent of market participants WestConnect evolved from an earlier Southwestern RTO development project named DesertSTAR and it has used the operating protocols developed by DesertSTAR stakeholders through extensive negotiations during the last four years DesertSTAR Chairman of the Board Jack King said WestConnect is a logical step I am encouraged by the actions of the WestConnect members in building upon the work of DesertSTAR to move toward an RTO for the West The group turned to the forprofit governance structure in lieu of the notforprofit DesertSTAR model in response to recent FERC rulings and a desire to create a governance structure that will encourage innovation and creativity in the operation and further development of the Western transmission grid WestConnect has been structured to permit involvement by investorowned utilities cooperatives publicpower entities and federal power marketing agencies so it can transition into the RTO for the West WestConnect is working closely with other utility companies and provisional RTO projects to explore expanding WestConnects service area WestConnect utilities say they are confident their filing with FERC conforms to the regulatory agencys established organizational and operating guidelines

Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers Dow Jones Interactive October Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter Dow Jones Interactive October FERC extends price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON Oct Reuters The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April for the price cap which first went into effect in July of last year However FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time Therefore FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running We believe that our decision will promote price certainty and market participants confidence in the New York ISOadministered markets which will increase supply improve reliability and lower energy prices the agency said in its order The New York ISO operates one of the nations biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions The price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices The cap is supported by several large utilities such as Consolidated Edison Inc which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the states power grid FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nations power grid Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers However some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines Creating chaos out of order Power play Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers USING scare and bully tactics the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control Thats the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nations electric grid The efficient stable economical PJM Interconnection grid system thats taken over years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of highcost New York Marylands carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years Challenges by Maryland Virginia and Washington to the federal agencys mandate have been ignored So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire Curiously FERC cited the PJM network which includes Maryland as a model for the nation Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems Warning of California type energy problems for the rest of the nation FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better It ignores the fact that California is the largest US electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them Even within PJM which serves five states and Washington members hold differing positions on forming megaregional networks But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its million customers well Theres little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES Dow Jones The California agency buying power in lieu of the states ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of a megawatthour the agency said Wednesday The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as a megawatthour because it secured too much electricity under longterm contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov Gray Davis the department said In a press release the departments California Energy Resources Scheduling division its powermarketing arm said it resold megawatthours or of its total purchases That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts not the longterm contracts the department said Such sales are typical of any powerbuying operation as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways the department said The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the states three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own longterm contracts or about onethird of the total According to the DWR power secured under Davis longterm contracts covers onethird to onehalf of the electricity it must supply Shortterm deals such as monthly or quarterly contracts represent onethird of the portfolio The rest is bought in the spot market The state has put its average cost of power under the longterm contracts at cents per kilowatthour for the first five years and cents per kilowatthour for the next five years Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices Similarly the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position the department said The DWR buys power for customers of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric

formation Dow Jones Interactive October State loses million in power plays ploys It sold some energy for loss gave some away Sacramento California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least million in power trading losses The state Department of Water Resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold megawatt hours of electricity during the threemonth period ending in June That represents about percent of the total traded during that period Included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all On May the state sold megawatt hours of power for cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The state paid an average of a megawatt hour during May Two days later the state gave away megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility We may not have had a buyer said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Its not a storable product Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesnt need it Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March when million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about minutes Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fastchanging the electricity supplyanddemand situation was during the height of the energy crisis State officials say it is normal for any energybuying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally Turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly powerbuying costs But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at abovemarket rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business I suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the Department of Water Resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen Two propositions on SF ballot If San Francisco voters decide Nov that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than PGE it will be some time before the switch is flipped Propositions F and I which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures There is also uncertainty about the costs Neither measure has a price tag attached For more than two decades in San Francisco PGE has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voterbacked initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system The move gained steam with the state energy crisis If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov they will join more than public jurisdictions including Sacramento Los Angeles and Seattle that provide electric power to about million customers accounting for percent of the demand in the United States Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district or MUD in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors Measurebackers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district The directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PGE and the San Franciscoowned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency The other measure Proposition F would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors and would replace the mayorappointed Public Utilities Commission The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses Like the MUD called for in Proposition I the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power Then with the consent of the Board of Supervisors the agency could take over PGEs electricity system No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under million without approval by supervisors or voters Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum The Prop F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy Props F and I both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power If both measures pass Prop I will take priority Supervisors placed Prop F on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PGE The utility waged a year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento and eventually lost Opponents of the SF public power effort with PGE at the lead already have spent more than on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks ATT and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco as well Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PGEs distribution system at million Other estimates have ranged from million to billion A lot of people are not happy with PGE But neither of these measures can guarantee that theyre going to solve the states power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said Jim Mathias vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce The unknown could be worse Proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders Historically such public power systems have had lower rates The only unknowns are ephemeral because weve seen through the Sacramento MUD the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power advocate THE MUD MEASURES San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov ballot PROPOSITION F Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors the measure would Abolish San Franciscos Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency The agency would be governed by an elected sevenmember board of directors Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system which is now operated by the city PUC Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Cos control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses It also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local PUC has Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters Any bond issue of more than million would be subject to referendum Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall For example the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PGEs distribution lines and generation facilities PROPOSITION I Placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane The district would be run by an elected fivemember board of directors Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov ballot Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PGEs electrical and distribution system in San Francisco as well as the Hetch Hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers Requires a feasibility study of such an action Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts Give the MUD power as a state agency independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds Power plant assessment to be taken over by state Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year The delay until Jan is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan Under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg which has been fighting the plan The city which has two new power plants expected million in property tax revenue With the changes that will be reduced to just said John Knox an attorney hired by the city Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community Youll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board There will be an even bigger energy crisis He said the move will have a devastating effect on the citys redevelopment agency Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation CALGARY Dow Jones The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a twoyear moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coalfired generation plants Loosening Ontario Power Generations hold on the bulk of the provinces power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May after three delays in as many years Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives said John Dalton director at Navigant Consulting Inc in Toronto The utility has five coalfired power plants including the megawatt Naticoke and MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels Right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we dont have a power market we have a regulatory scheme Dalton said Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its antipollution regulations The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuelburning generation stations starting Jan and will be fully implemented by Under the governments plan for deregulation OPG must sell or lease about MW of nonnuclear power within months of market opening The utility owns MW of fossilfuel capacity MW of nuclear power and MW of hydroelectric power Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market OPG spokesman John Earl said This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring Were working on being ready for March an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down Thats what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPGs aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesnt make them that attractive to buyers Dalton said Lakeview operates about of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleanerburning natural gas plants Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates FERC to give states a role in RTO formation WASHINGTON Oct Reuters US federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees the countrys power grid operators has ordered utilities in the Southeast Northeast Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations RTOs by the end of the year The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter in which the antiquated US grid prevented more power from flowing into the state FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rulemaking process STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies Citing states confusion about FERCs direction and inconsistent internal agency communication Brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation The request was made by David Svanda commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERCs workshop on RTOs last week The move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to cogovern the process with them FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting Wood previously headed Texas state utility regulatory agency Of state commissions Wood said they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table not just standing at the door taking tickets COSTBENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED FERC also promised to prepare a formal costbenefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits The agency did not say when the study would be completed On Tuesday the New York Independent System Operator ISO released its own costbenefit study which asserted the creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer power bills by some million a year The nonprofit New York ISO would also be put out of business by a regional forprofit RTO However a separate study issued last month by energy firm Mirant Corp a supporter of RTOs concluded that a Northeastern RTO would save consumers million annually At the meeting FERC commissioners heard staff presentations on RTO development progress in the Southeast Northeast and Midwest But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC will take in guiding utilities Wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on Nov just a month ahead of FERCs Dec deadline for RTO membership Under FERCs plan the RTOs would be forprofit groups in the US Northeast Midwest Southeast and West Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers

companies SF Gate News November India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week Dow Jones Interactive November Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation Dow Jones Interactive November Governors greased lighting Davis criticized for accepting money from power companies Sacramento After having sworn off campaign contributions from energy companies Gov Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state The two contributions came during a series of fundraisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon The Democratic governor who has raised more than million for his re election campaign has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration Yesterday Davis defended the decision to take the money saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned If it was dirty money before it is even dirtier now said Rosenfield who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over Rosenfield said Tell that to the million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of percent he said The two companies FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC each gave to Davis campaign fund Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California Caithness Energy a New Yorkbased generator is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month The company wants to build a megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County And subsidiaries of FPL Energy a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country are in negotiations with the states new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them In addition Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County That project was approved by the states Energy Commission in March Garry South Davis political adviser said the campaigns position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state he said South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week NEW DELHI Dow Jones Prospective buyers of the foreign equity in Indias megawatt Dabhol Power Co will start due diligence of the project next week AK Doda executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India PIDB told Dow Jones Newswires Friday The possible buyers are Tata Power Co Ltd PTPW and BSES Ltd PBSX After the due diligence is completed price negotiations will start and thereafter the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place Doda said US energy company Enron Corp ENE has a controlling equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plants sole customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the Indian federal governments failure to honor payment guarantees In August the US company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost Dabhol is Indias largest single foreign investment to date MSEB has while USbased companies General Electric Co GE and Bechtel XBTL own each in DPC The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties through mutual negotiations Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest Doda said Doda denied local media reports saying that Indias stateowned firm National Thermal Power Corp PNTP was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol So far I am aware of only two companies Tata Power and BSES NTPC havent sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project he said Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation The planned deregulation of the billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinces electricity transmission company preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market The plan known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders would turn Hydro One into a notforprofit entity instead of a fully commercial privatized company If this happens Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continents premier transmission companies a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe David Lindsay the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp the governments privatization adviser confirmed that turning Hydro One into a notforprofit organization similar to Nav Canada the civil air navigation service is under serious consideration Weve been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro Ones future including this one he said yesterday He would not provide details though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro Ones future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year A senior official in the Ontario government who did not want to be identified said the proposal is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro He was referring to the debtladen utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation the electricity generating arm and Hydro One whose network of highvoltage transmission lines spans kilometres The Premiers office would not comment A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that there are a number of options on the table Sources on Bay Street and at Queens Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a notforprofit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell the chairman of Royal Bankowned RBC Dominion Securities Bay Streets largest dealer If the new Hydro One took this shape it would raise about billion through the sale of bonds to investors The dealers commission on the sale of the bonds which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history would range from million to million one Bay Street executive said Mr Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the billion in stranded debt racked up by the old Ontario Hydro The generating and transmission giants decadeslong spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the provinces balance sheet Hydro Ones cash flow derived from sales to electricity users would be used to pay the interest on the billion of bonds Presumably consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest If Hydro One were a private company instead its financial risk would be borne by shareholders not ratepayers The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan citing client confidentiality concerns Mr Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices by next spring The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One both of which are per cent owned by the government into commercial companies In Hydro Ones case the leading options were thought to be an outright sale in which the utility would be bought by another company presumably a rival utility or an initial public offering where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange The third option converting Hydro One into a notforprofit organization has come as a surprise There has been no debate on this option though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the notforprofit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business The notforprofit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes which raises potential trade issues with the United States American transmission companies might argue that Hydro Ones nontaxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options Rod Taylor Hydro Ones executive vicepresident would not comment on the notforprofit option being contemplated by the government He said however that the companys strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector he said in a phone interview Stanley Hartt the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Streets Salomon Smith Barney is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a notforprofit structure for Hydro One Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro Ones strategic business plan In a threepage letter sent this week to the top executives of several large powerusing Ontario companies he said that this idea is shortsighted and bad for Ontario He argued that the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the notforprofit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers He also said that without financial flexibility Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in new bottleneckeliminating connections that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission he said In a recent report on the power industry TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States where ownership tends to be fragmented He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years and he said the utility has the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive highgrowth initiatives According to sources familiar with the notforprofit proposal Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users such as auto and steel makers and paper companies Such a structure exists at Nav Canada with airline executives on the board and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers Restructuring Hydro One with debt rather than equity is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company The problem with a Canadian National Railstyle IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt said one financier familiar with the proposal With a debtbased structure every dollar earned is available to pay interest while an equitybased structure means you pay federal taxes provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments Dofasco Inc the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about million of electricity a year supports the notforprofit proposal Gord Forstner head of communications said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydros stranded debt by billion immediately paving the way for lower electricity charges Currently a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt The charge costs Dofasco alone about million a year We want to see the stranded debt paid down first Mr Forstner said Until that happens we dont favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding

that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win Colen who lives in the West Portal area voted against two measures on the Nov ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PGEs monopoly in the local energy market The company and other corporate interests spent more than million to defeat the effort Colens vote reflected the sentiment throughout the citys conservative strongholds among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff In those neighborhoods Proposition F and Measure I lost almost to In the citys more liberal neighborhoods HaightAshbury Bernal Heights South of Market and Noe Valley the reverse was true And in the Mission support for public power was almost to Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano a public power booster Once we engaged people talked to them they were very responsive I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again For Colen an environmental geologist and consultant the proposals were poorly drafted more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PGE than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably as backers of the measures promised San Francisco can get into the energy business said Colen But it should be incremental with a sound policy and with people in charge who are experts In addition he doesnt want an elected board running the operation as both Measure I and Proposition F required and he wants the city to explore working with PGE instead of ousting the private utility competely Then Colen said he may support public power Proposition F called for replacing the citys existing water and power department with a new expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers It lost by votes or less than percentage point Measure I the more farreaching of the two lost by votes or percentage points It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane It made a target of PGE but also had the power to take over the garbage cable and phone operations Despite the loss supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval At the same time they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year Bob Lipman a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system It was a blank check he said He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down Supervisor Tony Hall the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy People want to know how much this is going to cost Hall said Ammiano the author of Proposition F said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs generation capabilities financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests business owners and property owners backing the idea Ammiano said Another factor he said is voter turnout If we had percent higher turnout we probably would have won Ammiano said For example several neighborhoods among them the Western Addition Civic Center and the South of Market had turnout lower than the citywide average which was just less than percent Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters not putting efforts into wooing conservatives I truly believe I dont have to change peoples minds said Daly who favors local control of the electrical system I represent the majority opinion But the majority doesnt necessarily come out to vote Thats what we have to work on PGE CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ PGE crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas Electric in bankruptcy court The substation cleanup should be completed by midDecember at a cost of said PGE spokesman Jason Alderman Cleaning up Tom Billeccis and Vince Aiellos properties will cost about Once the substation site is free of contaminants the utility will sell the property to a developer who plans to build apartments The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property Alderman said The reason its expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done he said The utility operated a substation at the site from to The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PGE about the cleanup for a year They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer asthma and skin disorders The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup PGE will clean the area around a shed on Billeccis property something it had not planned to do before Billecci said he is pleased that PGE agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates when deregulation begins Residential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about percent Thats according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission Under the new socalled pricetobeat rate which still needs PUC approval someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save over the course of a year while someone using an average of kilowatthours a month could save annually The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed This years increase though was rescinded as gas prices came down The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan when Texas opens its electricity market to competition is known as the price to beat Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors which in turn are expected to offer lower rates Other incumbent electric companies including Dallasbased TXU Energy will charge their own pricetobeat rates in their service territories The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices To set the price to beat the PUC uses complex formulas Costs are sorted into several categories including a base rate as well as costs tied to the price of natural gas which affects the price of electricity Under the deregulation law consumers automatically get a percent cut in the base portion starting Jan which depending on usage can make up percent of a consumers costs The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the socalled fuelfactor portion of the price to beat The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company The threemember commission still must give its approval which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec meeting The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses kilowatthours of electricity in a year or an average of a month is cents per kilowatthour Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday the cost would be cents per kilowatthour Thats a drop of percent Those per kilowatthour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher Reliant charges different rates for summer and non summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins The per kilowatthour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized average rates All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an applestoapples way to compare them Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the baserate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose percent of their customers The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs Earlier this week consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC if adopted could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers That option which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed isnt included in Reliants filing A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea and its unknown whether the PUC will ever take an upordown vote Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be In a filing Thursday with the PUC the New Power Co which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program New Power said New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition but like everyone else we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds it said
