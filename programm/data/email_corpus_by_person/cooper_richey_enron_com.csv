windfall by mailing out rebate checks to million customers Their good fortune though has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be shortlived A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the region If it continues utilities along the river will have to buy power and may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall This is not nice money said Alice Parker a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their airconditioners Nice or not a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County a publicly owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year than it ever had before With just local customers the utility last year had a million profit It paid its two top power traders each an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less than a year The utility refuses to reveal the traders names for fear their children might be kidnapped The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were huge and obscene But the executive Charles J Hosken added We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners Next door in equally sparse Grant County a public utility that also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market It had a record million in profits last year more than double its best previous year Grant County Public Utility District which has just retail customers is using its windfall to help build a million fiber optic network for local residents It has also bought diesel generators to guard against power shortages and if possible exploit the power goldrush The utility estimates that those generators could add million to profits in the coming year Like Chelan Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity when as now local needs exceed generating capacity in the river Power rates in Grant and Chelan Counties are about onefifth as much as in New York City Grant Countys utility has rejected for the time being the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity asked Lon Topaz director of resource management for the utility It would be lousy politics An UpsideDown Economy The secondworst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined with Californias deregulation mess to further distort the energy market Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market to times as much as last years price it has strengthened a compelling bottomline rationale for conservation Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest often at lockedin longterm prices that are a fraction of the current market rate can be sent south to California For many utilities conservation spells local savings and a longdistance bonanza As a result a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower has been stood on its head Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to an acre not to farm Similarly aluminum companies are collecting about billion this year by not making aluminum Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight Wall Street while keeping about workers on their payroll by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mids under a cheap longterm contract Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washington and Idaho cents for every kilowatt they do not use if their consumption falls more than percent below last years level For utilities in the Northwest by far the largest profits from Californias electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia A number of private American utilities have also benefited from Californias troubles BC Hydro a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed billion in profits as measured in Canadian currency million in United States currency To celebrate the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it had never done before The utility mailed each of its customers a check for BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates which have not gone up for seven years We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight said Brian R D Smith chairman of BC Hydro When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operator which runs that states power grid accused BC Hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging Mr Smith was less happy All they do is scream and shout and they wont pay you the money they owe you he said arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help California in its hour of need Gouging has nothing to do with it he said adding that it was Californias awful mess in deregulating power markets that fueled BC Hydros record profits A Good Deal for Farmers In the beginning that is to say when federal money began transforming the Columbia from the worlds premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable lakes no one paid much attention to electricity The river possessed a third of Americas hydroelectric potential but there were not enough people in the Northwest to use more than a fraction of it and longdistance highvoltage transmission lines did not exist The main intention when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in the s was to create family farms Grand Coulee Dam the biggest dam in North America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant was primarily designed as a waterdelivery device for farmers Since then as miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shuttle water around in sagebrush country each acre farm in the Columbia Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least million in federal infrastructure subsidies according to the Bureau of Reclamation which built it In addition farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out of the river at a megawatt A megawatt of electricity currently sells for to on the spot market As Paul Pitzer a Columbia Basin historian has written farmers here have always felt that no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill This year though the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that markets electricity from federal dams on river The agency calculated that if it could persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate acres of land water left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as million if it had to be purchased at current market prices In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest Bonneville is paying farmers a total of million The farmers receive for each acre they do not farm On top of that Grant Countys public utility is paying many of the same farmers about an acre not to farm their land On April about irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe here in George to discuss the buyout Since farm prices are low this year they agreed that it was a good deal Still the farmers who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash This has to be a temporary deal said Tom Flynt who normally farms acres but has taken acres out of production because of the buyout If anybody thought this would affect their water rights there would be no takers Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting the lifestyles of urban people especially Californians who those who were interviewed said do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full said Tricia C Lubach a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer Not too long ago they didnt worry about where the power comes from Someday they may think about where the food comes from A Wonderful Energy Fit A couple of hundred miles northwest of George in a penthouse conference room that overlooks Vancouver harbor Mr Smith the chairman of British Columbias most profitable company explained in midApril what a pain it was selling electricity to Californians People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Californians he said It does not help he added that the state is behind on its bills by about million Still neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose Californias money The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget which in the last decade has received more than billion from BC Hydro We have a wonderful energy fit Mr Smith said referring to BC Hydros powertrading relationship with California if not to Californians themselves We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high demand and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell power when it is most needed and most expensive in California The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap offpeak power brought from across the West In the morning when prices peak it opens the faucets and zaps electricity off to California We spill water during the day Mr Smith said Why Is it because we can make more money No Its because that is when everybody wants electricity for Gods sake Questions about profit gouging on the part of damdependent utilities in the Northwest may soon be moot Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff so far this year to about half of what is considered normal The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for naturalgasfired power plants and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it Absent being successful in getting loads down we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates said Paul Norman head of power operations at Bonneville Unless conservation increases or the drought eases Mr Norman warned that by late summer the Northwests era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive end

confirmed as a worm attack For those not familiar with the term a worm is an attack program that automatically launches a new attack from each machine that it breaks into This particular worm is attacking both Microsoft IIS servers which we knew and Sun Solaris systems The CERT advisory discussing the worm is attached below The Solaris vulnerability is a bug that was discovered two years ago and the patch has been available Hopefully very few of our systems will have this vulnerability but two EBS servers that we are aware of have already been compromised Compromised Sun systems are used to launch further attacks and may be seen by others as Enron systems launching attacks Please check immediately to ensure that all of your Internet facing servers have either had the patches installed or are not running the affected software We have contacted the FBI to report these attacks If you do discover any other compromised servers please make backups of all logs and files that may have been

up to and including Solaris Overview The CERTCC has received reports of a new piece of selfpropagating malicious code referred to here as the sadmindIIS worm The worm uses two wellknown vulnerabilities to compromise systems and deface web pages I Description Based on preliminary analysis the sadmindIIS worm exploits a vulnerability in Solaris systems and subsequently installs software to attack Microsoft IIS web servers In addition it includes a component to propagate itself automatically to other vulnerable Solaris systems It will add to the rhosts file in the root users home directory Finally it will modify the indexhtml on the host Solaris system after compromising IIS systems To compromise the Solaris systems the worm takes advantage of a twoyearold buffer overflow vulnerability in the Solstice sadmind program For more information on this vulnerability see vulsid advisoriesCAhtml After successfully compromising the Solaris systems it uses a sevenmonthold vulnerability to compromise the IIS systems For additional information about this vulnerability see vulsid Solaris systems that are successfully compromised via the worm exhibit the following

wanna spend the winter leading ecotours in the yucatan check this out Background CESiaK is located on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico near the Mayan Ruins of Tulum south of Cancun Still under development the center is a small ecotourism and education center that will serve as a model for sustainable development in sensitive tropical ecosystems The revenue generated through tours and various onsite activities is used to fund conservation and education programs within the Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve The Center operates using ecologically responsible technologies including systems for wetland waste management rainwater collection and solar and wind energy generation It also focuses on community development educational outreach programs turtle conservation programs and biological research including propagation and revegetation of native plants CESiaK provides a model for other sustainable development projects as well as an informational resource for the Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve EcoTourism Guide Position At CESiaK we currently offer an allday educational sightseeing boat tour through the Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve and a shorter sunset tour emphasizing birdwatching Highlights of the Tour include Following the Mayan trade route used years ago Seeing abundant flora and fauna unique to Sian Kaan Visiting unexcavated Mayan ruins hidden within the Reserve Floating down a freshwater river and swimming in natural sinkholes Learning the natural and Mayan history of the Reserve with experienced guides The primary responsibility of the tour guide is to lead these tours and educate tourists about the unique diversity of ecosystems flora and fauna found within the Reserve Other responsibilities include preparing food coolers for the tours communicating problems with tour equipment and driving and maintaining the two tour vans Depending on qualifications and interest the guide would also work with other staff members to carry out other programs undertaken by CESiaK Qualifications The ideal candidate would have an undergraduate or graduate degree in biology or environmental science as well as an interest and understanding of general socioeconomic issues of Latin America including Mayan culture and history However all candidates with a strong interest in learning will certainly be considered Once hired the guide will be thoroughly trained to lead the tours Because in many senses the tour guide is the face of the organization it is crucial to have proven exemplary communication skills command of the Spanish language an independent motivation to selfmanage the broad responsibilities of the tours and a dedication to conservation Please visit our website for more information wwwcesiakorg Contact us at Phone Cel japhet

JOKES A man is in a hotel lobby He wants to ask the clerk a question As he turns to go to the front desk he accidentally bumps into a woman beside him and as he does his elbow goes into her breast They are both startled and he says Maam if your heart is as soft as your breast I know youll forgive me She replies if your penis is as hard as your elbow Im in room A young man walks up and sits down at the bar What can I get you the bartender inquires I want shots of Jagermeister responded the young man shots Are you celebrating something Yeah my first blowjob Well in that case let me give you a th on the house No offense sir but if shots wont get rid of the taste nothing will A businessman boards a flight and is lucky enough to be seated next to an absolutely gorgeous woman They exchange brief hellos and he notices she is reading a manual about sexual statistics He asks her about it and she replies This is a very interesting book about sexual statistics It identifies that American Indians have the longest average penis and Polish men have the biggest average diameter By the way my name is Jill Whats yours He coolly replies Tonto Kawalski nice to meet you One night as a couple lay down for bed the husband gently taps his wife on the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm The wife turns over and says Im sorry honey Ive got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to stay fresh The husband rejected turns over and tries to sleep A few minutes later he rolls back over and taps his wife again This time he whispers in her ear Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow too Bill worked in a pickle factory He had been employed there for a number of years when he came home one day to confess to his wife that he had a terrible compulsion He had an urge to stick his penis into the pickle slicer His wife suggested that he should see a sex therapist to talk about it but Bill indicated that hed be too embarrassed He vowed to overcome the compulsion on his own One day a few weeks later Bill came home absolutely ashen His wife could see at once that something was seriously wrong Whats wrong Bill she asked Do you remember that I told you how I had this tremendous urge to put my penis into the pickle slicer Oh Bill you didnt Yes I did My God Bill what happened I got fired No Bill I mean what happened with the pickle slicer Ohshe got fired too A man was visiting his wife in hospital where she has been in a coma for several years On this visit he decides to rub her left breast instead of just talking to her On doing this she lets out a sigh The man runs out and tells the doctor who says this is a good sign and suggests he should try rubbing her right breast to see if there is any reaction The man goes in and rubs her right breast and this brings a moan From this the doctor suggests that the man should go in and try oral sex saying he will wait outside as it is a personal act and he doesnt want the man to be embarrassed The man goes in then comes out about five minutes later white as a sheet and tells the doctor his wife is dead The doctor asks what happened to which the man replies She choked A guy walks into a bar with a pet alligator by his side He puts the alligator up on the bar He turns to the stonished patrons Ill make you a deal Ill open this alligators mouth and place my genitals inside Then the gator will close his mouth for one minute Hell then open his mouth and Ill remove my unit unscathed In return for witnessing this spectacle each of you will buy me a drink The crowd murmured their approval The man stood up on the bar dropped his trousers and placed his privates in the alligators open mouth The gator closed his mouth as the crowd gasped After a minute the man grabbed a beer bottle and rapped the alligator hard on the top of its head The gator opened his mouth and the man removed his genitals unscathed as promised The crowd cheered and the first of his free drinks were delivered The man stood up again and made another offer Ill pay anyone whos willing to give it a try A hush fell over the crowd After a while a hand went up in the back of the bar A woman timidly spoke up Ill try but you have to promise not
