CAMANO ISLAND A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living police said Wednesday Deputies from the Island County Sheriffs Office said they removed more than marijuana plants including or so mature plants from a shed behind the yearold mans home on Maple Tree Lane a deadend road on the south end of the island The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theaters courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living and he allegedly said he grew marijuana According to a police report the man then asked for the officers help in harvesting the crop The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the mans operation and the naked man agreed In the outbuilding behind the mans mobile home police found what they described as a sophisticated hydroponic grow operation Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants Police said the man seemed proud of his operation telling them that the system used no dirt just lava rock and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer In a written statement to police the man allegedly said I grow marijuana for fun and profit to support myself and my family to help bring us a better life He also said he was growing marijuana for his father who had a disease and for other medically ill people The mans wife told police she had never been inside her husbands shed but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yoyo Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden and the man said he didnt expect them to do anything Police however confiscated the plants and growing equipment The man was cooperative they said even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance but he is not named because charges have not been filed You can call

Large numbers of homosexual men and a smaller number of heterosexuals are combining Viagra with illicit drugs to achieve a potentially deadly sexual high a new study finds The men combine the popular impotence drug with illicit club drugs such as ecstasy ketamine amphetamines GHB and poppers The study discussed last week at the Centers for Disease Controls HIV news DailyNewsmanualsearchnewspHIVcnynccnewscsnw web sites DailyNewsmanualbinsearchpHIV Prevention Conference focuses on highrisk behavior among gay men who use Viagra to heighten their sexual experience San Francisco epidemiologist Andrea Kim who conducted the study says it and other studies in California and London have shown that gay men are combining Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexual men and that puts them at higher risk Her sa common side effect of club drugs is loss of erection We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function so the men are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability Kim says Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite an inhaled stimulant commonly referred to as poppers University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emergency room physician Dr Daniel Keyes says that amyl nitrite makes the heart race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events Like Viagra amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood pressure Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a person has a heart attack or stroke Although rare another medical condition that can occur is priapism a severely painful problem that can result in permanent damage caused by the penis being erect for many hours Original Message From Cuilla Martin mailtoMartin NRONcom Sent

CAMANO ISLAND A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living police said Wednesday Deputies from the Island County Sheriffs Office said they removed more than marijuana plants including or so mature plants from a shed behind the yearold mans home on Maple Tree Lane a deadend road on the south end of the island The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theaters courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living and he allegedly said he grew marijuana According to a police report the man then asked for the officers help in harvesting the crop The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the mans operation and the naked man agreed In the outbuilding behind the mans mobile home police found what they described as a sophisticated hydroponic grow operation Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants Police said the man seemed proud of his operation telling them that the system used no dirt just lava rock and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer In a written statement to police the man allegedly said I grow marijuana for fun and profit to support myself and my family to help bring us a better life He also said he was growing marijuana for his father who had a disease and for other medically ill people The mans wife told police she had never been inside her husbands shed but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yoyo Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden and the man said he didnt expect them to do anything Police however confiscated the plants and growing equipment The man was cooperative they said even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance but he is not named because charges have not been filed You can call

BRONX NYThe Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hiphop album liner notes Monday when He gave a shoutout back to all His loyal niggaz picsgodgivesshoutoutjpg Above Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God inset Right about now I want to send a shoutout to each and every nigga whos shown Me love through the years said the Lord His booming voice descending from Heaven I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz Yall real niggaz out there you know who you are Yall was there for me and its about time Ima give some love back to Gods true crew All yall niggaz yall be My niggaz the Lord added As of press time God has thanked nearly of His niggaz including those in New Yorks Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin it down in New Orleans Nelly and the whole St Lunatics crew Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad His peeps from back in the day and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown He also sent shoutouts to everybody in the Old School as well as to Lil Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up Mad props to P Diddy JayZ DMX Lil Kim Mystikal Eve Ja Rule Jadakiss Trick Daddy and Xzibit And one love to Meth RZA GZA Ghostface and the rest of My real niggaz in the WuTang Clan the deity said These My beloved niggaz with whom I be wellpleased Now nearing the hour mark the Lords firstever reciprocal shoutout shows little sign of slowing down Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past years hiphop experts say the historic shoutout is likely to continue through early next week In addition to raps current stars God offered shoutouts to the original hiphop heads including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash Busy Bee Melle Mel Jazzy Jay Kool Moe Dee Afrika Bambaataa DJ Red Alert the Cold Crush Brothers Fab Freddy Kurtis Blow Kool Herc and the Funky God also offered shoutouts to the many DJs record labels magazines TV shows and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hiphop over the years Among them are Def Jam Tommy Boy Jive RocAFella Rap Pages The Source Right On The Box Funkmaster Flex Ed Lover and Dr Dre WBLS KISSFM and Hot For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully I say thank you God said All praise to Devante Harrell Wanda Simmons LaShell Thomas and everybody else at UptownMCA for making this possible picsgodgivesshoutoutjumpjpg Above A pair of shoutout tablets handed down by the Lord As a further sign of His love for the hiphop community God assured the nations rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven Tupac Notorious BIG EazyE Scott LaRocksome of yall niggaz are already up in this bitch the Lord said For those of you who were left behind know that the Lord has got your dead homies backs Faith Evans I promise Im taking real good care of your Biggie He resting in crazy peace no doubt Thus far God has not played favorites thanking such fallenoff acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong The Lord has also seen fit to thank the littleknown likes of Baby Tragic DJ Phreek Malik and Da Ill CollectorMCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hiphop community has heard of them All rappers God explained are equal in His sight and none are too small to escape His notice God sees even the smallest sparrow fall said Dr Cornell West Harvard University professor of AfricanAmerican studies and philosophy of religion The same is true of MCs Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown all rappers are His children and He loves them all The sheer volume of names notwithstanding the nations rappers are deeply touched by Gods gesture of tribute and appreciation with many stating that they feelin Him God is the Original Brooklynbased rapper Mos Def said The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word nigga On Mondays Larry King Live conservative activist Rev Calvin Butts a longtime ally of the Lord blasted Him for His shocking unexpected use of the racially loaded Nword Some concerned parties including decency crusader C Delores Tucker Sen Orrin Hatch RUT and members of the San Franciscobased What About The Children Foundation are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology Reacting to the controversy many in the hiphop community are rushing to the Lords defense The word nigga means different things depending on how its used and whos saying it rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said Judging from context God obviously wasnt being derogatory He was using nigga as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene At one point He said I wanna give a shoutout to AdRock MC Serch and my man Dan The Automatorall yall is real niggaz in My allbenevolent sight Considering the fact that AdRock and Serch are Jewish and the Automator is AsianAmerican its clear God isnt talking about race here Hes just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him Gods the ultimate playa so naturally Hes going to have some haters rapper Ice Cube said But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs you will get your ass smote True dat cgibinemailemailthiscgi

view from Afghanistan by a UC Berkeley professor A sobering essay forwarded by a UC Berkeley professor Dear Friends The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an AfghaniAmerican writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in Gary T Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Get your FREE
