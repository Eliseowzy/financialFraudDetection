<29291411.1075847576451.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.kaufman@enron.com,2001-05-31 10:39:00,Meeting in Wyoming Cc speech Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail levelbut silent on electric restructuring

<5228260.1075848019779.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.kaufman@enron.com,2001-05-31 10:39:00,Meeting in Wyoming Cc speech Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge

was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail levelbut silent on electric restructuring

<13760114.1075844214048.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.kaufman@enron.com,2001-05-31 10:39:00,Meeting in Wyoming Cc speech Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail levelbut silent on electric restructuring

was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail levelbut silent on electric restructuring

<13530097.1075844273834.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.kaufman@enron.com,2001-05-31 10:39:00,Meeting in Wyoming Cc speech Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to speak The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorps reaction to the notion that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs at the retail level Another representative for one of the coal concerns made the same comment These comments took us towards a discussion of what went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity I partly agreed with PacifiCorpie I agreed that we were in a state of transition in the wholesale and retail markets I also pointed out that we couldnt look at California and reach any conclusion other than they messed up we didnt have an entirely free market in electricity in the Westie its a hybrid of regulation etc and that the model discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity a point that the Gov also made I said that it applies to wholesale electric markets in some areas coal markets gas markets and that the model applies in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling restructuring etc because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming The Governor on a number of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction ie away from retail Nancy Vanderberg El Pasoa former Enron employee sends her regards She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill off smaller local competitors I responded with the usualmake sure no barriers to entry when the price gets high enough competitors will take on WalMart etc Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on RTOs ensuring that all customers are treated the same etc The Gov gave a number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West etc The Gov mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy resources available to producers in Wyoming He also pointed out deficiencies in WyomingEast connections on both gas and electric as well as deficiencies in WyomingCalfornia pipeline constraints A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne FYI The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission Steve Reynolds are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron I affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient These guys are serious and dedicated The Commission was given a million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state During the meeting the Commission approved a series of additional meetings working groups and advisory committees Sue Landwehr and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the meetings working groups etc My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor and the Governors staff are familiar with how commodity markets workparticularly ag products They understand the concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is adequate transmission capacity gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission system a complete constraint moving east offpeak constraints moving north south and west limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline serving the state Kernperhaps due to downstream constraints and some problems with the cost of rail transportation if not a constraint While they have a working understanding of all these things they havent been able to put it all together in a cohesive way Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west and the rest of the country but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent state For example the state moved from a million deficit in FY to an approximately million surplus in FY They also want to diversify the states economy and bring economic development For example a major focus of the states Business Council has been to recruit server farmsbecause of their load and high load factors They talked about colocating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging In his comments to the Commission PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the state should clarify the utilitys responsibility to either build their own power plants or acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge Steve talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail levelbut silent on electric restructuring

Proposal for Legal Services RCR Here are my proposals for RCRs related to legal services in support of Enron legislative activities for May and the remainder of the session These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only and do not represent a commitment or a not to exceed figure for Goodin MacBride The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year Direct access legislation This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation My best estimate is per month or over three months The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the sessions last monthAugust As of May we have recorded approximately in billings related to direct access in this month Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation over three months more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August We have recorded approximately in billings related to this area this month through May Windfall profits tax bill This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax We have billed legal fees for approximately in May up through May My best estimate is over three months of session more if the bill is still alive in August Global settlementEdison MOUPlan B legislation This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis including a proposal by the Governor legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system commonly referred to as Plan B As explained by Paul Kaufman this work is expected to involve less work in the near term and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult but I am estimating over the next three months more if the package is still being enacted in August

Marcie NRON cc Paul CT Subject Re SDGE CCF Program Marcie Thanks for attending the meeting and for the feedback I will probably give you a ring tomorrow because Imnot sure I understand the matrix andthe distinction on the two of Account columns This information in your email is very valuable You may also want to participate in a call with the San Diego folks tomorrow at am pst and give them the scoop yourself Let me know if you can do that I will forward the call info to you Mona From Marcie Milner on PM MST To Mona L nron cc Paul CT Subject SDGE CCF Program Mona initially the discussion surrounded the radio ad SDGE suggested tagging the message with commercial customers check your mail but there were strong objections because the current draft uses the words free and price APSES stressed that if they arent going to tag the message they need to be explicit in stating who the audience is ie residential and small commercial The small customer group is currently revising the language and I suggested that it was premature to make a decision on content and on the existence of cross benefits until we see a final draft SDGE was able to determine an approximate number of only nonDA accounts segmented into three categories The data was pulled using unique name and unique address The data follows Category Customers of Accounts of Accounts A ONLY over Kw B over Kw AND under Kw C ONLY under Kw Totals The group decided that it would be best to send two letters one to classes AB and one to class C SDGE would state our records show you are a customer please refer to the matrix to determine which ESPs serve your customer class They did state that they have issues with credibility by identifying a small customer who may in fact be large when combined with existing DA accounts The matrix will include the following categories LogoName AddressPhoneWebsiteContact Customer Class Served indicated by some sort of code like a color coded check mark Products and Services Customer References and Company Description The BRC will be attached to the matrix and potentially will include the following three selections Send my information to ESPs that serve my customer class Send my information to all ESPs or Send my information to Only the following ESPs There was some discussion on the last selection surrounding whether or not to include all of the ESPs or require the customer to list them Most were neutral although New Energy wanted them listed and APSES thought Select might object We discussed the snipe on the envelope as well and the group came up with Important Energy Savings Opportunities Enclosed I voiced some objection about using the word savings as I wasnt certain what our liabilities are with respect to misleading the customer or potentially false representation We also discussed how to ensure that the mailer gets to the correct person as opposed to the bookkeeper We agreed that sending it to the attention of the CFOEnergy Manager might be our best bet In any event considering the number of direct mailers has dropped from to the direct mail budget is approximately including a BRC response estimate In addition the sixweek radio campaign beginning one week after the CPUC decision continuing through a week billing cycle with one followup week came to for the large customer groups portion Total per ESP assuming participate is SDGE indicated that they can return any overage but are restricted from asking for more As far as other channels SDGE plans to include a CCF link on their webpage where the customer can access the brochure APSES indicated that the BRC would need to be better developed for the website to ensure the customer has a place to include their account number and other pertinent information that is being preprinted on the BRC in the direct mailer SDGE also plans to include ESP links on their website provide the brochure to the press in conjunction with their press release and involve their account executives The AEs will be provided with extra brochures and SDGE is checking with their legal department on affiliate rules to determine if the AEs can provide customer contact information to the CCF Coordinators so that they might get the information directly to the customer The best case scenario time line is having a final resolution by the end of November with the standard day comment period This may place it on the CPUC agenda the first part of January with a day implementation period They had hoped to start the radio ad approximately days after the PUC decision They would like our logo in an eps file format at our earliest convenience so that they can determine how much additional space will be available for the matrix The rest of the timeline is still on track according to the emails you had forwarded Okay well thats all I have for now feel like you were there Let me know if you have any questions andor comments I also requested that they include me in any future correspondence because I would be backing you up when necessary

not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential

Marcie NRON cc Paul CT Subject Re SDGE CCF Program Marcie Thanks for attending the meeting and for the feedback I will probably give you a ring tomorrow because Imnot sure I understand the matrix andthe distinction on the two of Account columns This information in your email is very valuable You may also want to participate in a call with the San Diego folks tomorrow at am pst and give them the scoop yourself Let me know if you can do that I will forward the call info to you Mona From Marcie Milner on PM MST To Mona L nron cc Paul CT Subject SDGE CCF Program Mona initially the discussion surrounded the radio ad SDGE suggested tagging the message with commercial customers check your mail but there were strong objections because the current draft uses the words free and price APSES stressed that if they arent going to tag the message they need to be explicit in stating who the audience is ie residential and small commercial The small customer group is currently revising the language and I suggested that it was premature to make a decision on content and on the existence of cross benefits until we see a final draft SDGE was able to determine an approximate number of only nonDA accounts segmented into three categories The data was pulled using unique name and unique address The data follows Category Customers of Accounts of Accounts A ONLY over Kw B over Kw AND under Kw C ONLY under Kw Totals The group decided that it would be best to send two letters one to classes AB and one to class C SDGE would state our records show you are a customer please refer to the matrix to determine which ESPs serve your customer class They did state that they have issues with credibility by identifying a small customer who may in fact be large when combined with existing DA accounts The matrix will include the following categories LogoName AddressPhoneWebsiteContact Customer Class Served indicated by some sort of code like a color coded check mark Products and Services Customer References and Company Description The BRC will be attached to the matrix and potentially will include the following three selections Send my information to ESPs that serve my customer class Send my information to all ESPs or Send my information to Only the following ESPs There was some discussion on the last selection surrounding whether or not to include all of the ESPs or require the customer to list them Most were neutral although New Energy wanted them listed and APSES thought Select might object We discussed the snipe on the envelope as well and the group came up with Important Energy Savings Opportunities Enclosed I voiced some objection about using the word savings as I wasnt certain what our liabilities are with respect to misleading the customer or potentially false representation We also discussed how to ensure that the mailer gets to the correct person as opposed to the bookkeeper We agreed that sending it to the attention of the CFOEnergy Manager might be our best bet In any event considering the number of direct mailers has dropped from to the direct mail budget is approximately including a BRC response estimate In addition the sixweek radio campaign beginning one week after the CPUC decision continuing through a week billing cycle with one followup week came to for the large customer groups portion Total per ESP assuming participate is SDGE indicated that they can return any overage but are restricted from asking for more As far as other channels SDGE plans to include a CCF link on their webpage where the customer can access the brochure APSES indicated that the BRC would need to be better developed for the website to ensure the customer has a place to include their account number and other pertinent information that is being preprinted on the BRC in the direct mailer SDGE also plans to include ESP links on their website provide the brochure to the press in conjunction with their press release and involve their account executives The AEs will be provided with extra brochures and SDGE is checking with their legal department on affiliate rules to determine if the AEs can provide customer contact information to the CCF Coordinators so that they might get the information directly to the customer The best case scenario time line is having a final resolution by the end of November with the standard day comment period This may place it on the CPUC agenda the first part of January with a day implementation period They had hoped to start the radio ad approximately days after the PUC decision They would like our logo in an eps file format at our earliest convenience so that they can determine how much additional space will be available for the matrix The rest of the timeline is still on track according to the emails you had forwarded Okay well thats all I have for now feel like you were there Let me know if you have any questions andor comments I also requested that they include me in any future correspondence because I would be backing you up when necessary

Proposal for Legal Services RCR Here are my proposals for RCRs related to legal services in support of Enron legislative activities for May and the remainder of the session These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only and do not represent a commitment or a not to exceed figure for Goodin MacBride The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year Direct access legislation This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation My best estimate is per month or over three months The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the sessions last monthAugust As of May we have recorded approximately in billings related to direct access in this month Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation over three months more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August We have recorded approximately in billings related to this area this month through May Windfall profits tax bill This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax We have billed legal fees for approximately in May up through May My best estimate is over three months of session more if the bill is still alive in August Global settlementEdison MOUPlan B legislation This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis including a proposal by the Governor legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system commonly referred to as Plan B As explained by Paul Kaufman this work is expected to involve less work in the near term and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult but I am estimating over the next three months more if the package is still being enacted in August We have recorded approximately in billings on this issue through May this month Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above We are pleased to have the opportunity to be of
