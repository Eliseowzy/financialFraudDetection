the better part of two years this column has in one form or another pointed out accounting and growthrelated issues with PrePaid Legal ServicesPPDNYSE a multilevel marketing company that sells the legal equivalent of HMOs LMOs Yet even taking into account a brief stumble in its stock price a year ago after its cash flow had taken a dip PrePaid has always come through with higher earnings The company has gone so far as to trumpet those higher earnings with a reminder in a recent press release that it has landed on lists of best companies and fast growers compiled by Forbes Bloomberg and Investors Business Daily Never mind that shortsellers often mine those very lists for new ideas You cant help but wonder how some of them created such high growth Never mind that the metrics used by those publications dont look at the quality of those earnings Those kinds of lists generally look at the raw numbers that are spit out by a computer Earnings quality or lack thereof has always been the main attraction among shortsellers to the PrePaid story There are a number of reasons but perhaps the most simple PrePaid operates on what I like to call the goingupthedownescalator type of business model it has to run faster and faster just to keep up Or as is the case with PrePaid it has to write more and more new policies to compensate for commissions owed by salespeople Commissions owed by salespeople Read on Most of PrePaids salespeople are paid three years worth of commissions at the time a contract is sold Members can drop a contract after the first month and according to the company drop out within the first year To counter each cancellation and not lose on commissions theyve already received salespeople must sell additional memberships against those commissions or pay interest on the outstanding balance In order for those commissions not to come back and haunt the company it would seem membership growth would have to be constantly accelerating in order to rise faster than the commission advances on previous policies sold However just the opposite is happening and while commission advances continue to grow new membership growth is slowing On an annual basis it leapt by last quarter impressive until you see that it rose by in the same quarter a year earlier More to the point New membership growth has been falling every quarter for the last four barely budging last quarter at after peaking at in last years fourth quarter Yet talk to PrePaids loquacious CEO Harland Stonecipher about slowing membership growth and its almost as if he didnt hear the question He talks about the growth rate as if its impressive We think it can be up or better he says So I ask what about the falling sequential growth rate I hadnt really looked at that he says The CEO hadnt looked at the sequential growth rate But on an annual basis he continues its a good growth rate and we feel good about that Weve been able to have quarters of increased revenues and increased earnings we think we will be able to continue that But the company hasnt changed its allowance for doubtful accounts the amount it reserves against uncollected commissions on cancelled policies for five quarters despite a rise in commission advances Chief Operating Officer Randy Harp explains that the company has seen no need to do so because of the salesforce does of the sales and where of the production comes from of the salesforce he says collectibility becomes better its a component of not how much business he writes but who writes it Maybe but its hard to tell just by looking at PrePaids financial statements just how good the company really is at collecting commissions on canceled policies from its own agents It claims it has a lessthan default rate but shortsellers believe the risk is much higher as membership growth falls especially if the economy slows How much is currently at risk Hard to say The company merely breaks the commission advances shown on its balance sheet into two categories current and longterm Current reflects the first of three years worth of commission advances Long term is the balance If collections were never a problem one shortseller argues the longterm advance should never be more than twice the amount of the shortterm PrePaids longterm commission advances however are more like times the shortterm Still some analysts argue that PrePaid at times this years expected earnings of per share is cheap That depends of course on which earnings youre looking at If PrePaid were ultraconservative some shortsellers argue it would immediately take a hit against earnings on all commissions as theyve paid them out rather than amortizing them over three years as fees are collected If they were expensed when they were paid earnings for the nine months wouldve been lighter or roughly cents a share And instead of trading at times this years expected earnings it would trade at more like times arguably high the shortsellers say considering the risk And from the red flag file Any time a company touts the price of its stock to the point of using its stock to legitimize its story be on guard Ive written about one of Stoneciphers previous attempts to tout his stock before Well on Oct in response to a New York Stock Exchange inquiry into increased activity in its stock PrePaid issued a press release Instead of merely saying that it doesnt know why its stock has been active as most companies do PrePaid touts that its market cap had passed the financial milestone of billion and that its policies are now in million households Weve been referred to as one of the best kept secrets in America Stonecipher was quoted as saying And I believe these two announcements indicate that were reaching a point of familiarity and acceptance in the market Since then the market cap has fallen back to million So much for milestones Note After two interviews in recent weeks the company has apparently stopped
