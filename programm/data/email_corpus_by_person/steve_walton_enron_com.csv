is declining partly out of frustration with the slow progress being made I think however that we ought to think about the potential consequences of recommending a standard model If we simply endorse PJM then we may inadvertently get its warts as well no secondary transmission market ICAP market etc I think we are considering the same thing approach as was reported by Charles Yeungs in his note on Tuesdays InterRTO Coordination Seams Conference Harvey Reed Constellation Power suggested that FERC impose a standard tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing different proposals but would limit their ability to diverge from a single market model In addition to the standard model there needs to be a deadline for either filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff Without a feet to the fire feature nothing the grand stall will continue In arguing for a standard model the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should specific modifications to address our concerns On the transmission rights issue for instance a simple dont allocate solution wont work The lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of information and to the way the rights are defined If as Harvey Reed suggests RTOs can submit alternative approaches at least there will be pressure to get moving I have not discussed this idea with West Power It then occurred to me that FERC is unlikely to impose a standard tariff without a rulemaking proceeding Whether they could act by fiat or not is a moot point since I doubt that they would do so without creating a record There are two possible down sides to a rule making The outcome of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot The incumbents have a pretty good record in the past of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such as the native load exemption in Order No There is a also a distinct risk that PJMs ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given blessed status which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill battle The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current RTO discussions The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking creates an urgency to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off options from a new the standard for review The uncertainty prior to the issuance of Order No in fact had that effect in the West On the other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued This also happened prior to Order No with a number of companies sitting on their hands using the time delay to protect existing positions while whipping up State regulators fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to boost their own position These are only own views I have not had a chance to speak

MODEL TALKING POINTS Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East while maybe the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt everything that Steve W has been advocating Also I agree with the ISO being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem it is because the traders do not have access to all the information They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years they could essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade above the underlying FTRs as financial instruments Steve Walton PM To James D NRON cc Christi L CT Richard nron Sarah NRON Steven J nron Subject Re INTERIM MODEL TALKING POINTS Jim I have added my comments to your draft My concern with the Adopt PJM approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion management and the nature of future transmission rights Once adopted as the standard nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized approach is highly unlikely Unlike the British we have a hard time changing horses because of our multijurisdictional Federal system of government The PJMs lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation problem If that were true they New York would have a secondary market none exists there either The unpredictability of prices is probably the biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs I think the nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful During our discussion of Seabron Adamsons last draft I maintained that a centralized unit commitment process didnt fit the Pacific Northwest PNW with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation You asked me to provide more detail hydrothermal operation I am including a paper that covers the nature

is declining partly out of frustration with the slow progress being made I think however that we ought to think about the potential consequences of recommending a standard model If we simply endorse PJM then we may inadvertently get its warts as well no secondary transmission market ICAP market etc I think we are considering the same thing approach as was reported by Charles Yeungs in his note on Tuesdays InterRTO Coordination Seams Conference Harvey Reed Constellation Power suggested that FERC impose a standard tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing different proposals but would limit their ability to diverge from a single market model In addition to the standard model there needs to be a deadline for either filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff Without a feet to the fire feature nothing the grand stall will continue In arguing for a standard model the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should specific modifications to address our concerns On the transmission rights issue for instance a simple dont allocate solution wont work The lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of information and to the way the rights are defined If as Harvey Reed suggests RTOs can submit alternative approaches at least there will be pressure to get moving I have not discussed this idea with West Power It then occurred to me that FERC is unlikely to impose a standard tariff without a rulemaking proceeding Whether they could act by fiat or not is a moot point since I doubt that they would do so without creating a record There are two possible down sides to a rule making The outcome of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot The incumbents have a pretty good record in the past of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such as the native load exemption in Order No There is a also a distinct risk that PJMs ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given blessed status which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill battle The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current RTO discussions The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking creates an urgency to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off options from a new the standard for review The uncertainty prior to the issuance of Order No in fact had that effect in the West On the other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued This also happened prior to Order No with a number of companies sitting on their hands using the time

also a problem it is because the traders do not have access to all the information They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years they

is declining partly out of frustration with the slow progress being made I think however that we ought to think about the potential consequences of recommending a standard model If we simply endorse PJM then we may inadvertently get its warts as well no secondary transmission market ICAP market etc I think we are considering the same thing approach as was reported by Charles Yeungs in his note on Tuesdays InterRTO Coordination Seams Conference Harvey Reed Constellation Power suggested that FERC impose a standard tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing different proposals but would limit their ability to diverge from a single market model In addition to the standard model there needs to be a deadline for either filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff Without a feet to the fire feature nothing the grand stall will continue In arguing for a standard model the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should specific modifications to address our concerns On the transmission rights issue for instance a simple dont allocate solution wont work The lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of information and to the way the rights are defined If as Harvey Reed suggests RTOs can submit alternative approaches at least there will be pressure to get moving I have not discussed this idea with West Power It then occurred to me that FERC is unlikely to impose a standard tariff without a rulemaking proceeding Whether they could act by fiat or not is a moot point since I doubt that they would do so without creating a record There are two possible down sides to a rule making The outcome of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot The incumbents have a pretty good record in the past of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such as the native load exemption in Order No There is a also a distinct risk that PJMs ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given blessed status which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill battle The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current RTO discussions The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking creates an urgency to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off options from a new the standard for review The uncertainty prior to the issuance of Order No in fact had that effect in the West On the other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued This also happened prior to Order No with a number of companies sitting on their hands using the time delay to protect existing positions while whipping up State regulators fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to boost their own position These are only own views I have not had a chance to speak with West Power this week but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week Steve Christi L Nicolay PM To Steve CT cc James D NRON Richard nron Sarah NRON Steven J nron Subject Re INTERIM MODEL TALKING POINTS Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East while maybe the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt everything that Steve W has been advocating Also I agree with the ISO being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion occurs While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic nature is also a problem it is because the traders do not have access to all the information They have told me that if they had access to all the information about congestion from the past several years they could essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade above the underlying FTRs as financial instruments Steve Walton PM To James D NRON cc Christi L CT Richard nron Sarah NRON Steven J nron Subject Re INTERIM MODEL TALKING POINTS Jim I have added my comments to your draft My concern with the Adopt PJM approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion management and the nature of future transmission rights Once adopted as the standard nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized approach is highly unlikely Unlike the British we have a hard time changing horses because of our multijurisdictional Federal system of government The PJMs lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation problem If that were true they New York would have a secondary market none exists there either The unpredictability of prices is probably the biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs I think the nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful During our discussion of Seabron Adamsons last draft I maintained that a centralized unit commitment process didnt fit the Pacific Northwest PNW with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation You asked me to provide more detail hydrothermal operation I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment Given other work and travel it has taken some time to complete the paper and its examples I hope this will help

that LMP will work Mark was caught flat footed and unprepared for Dick ONiells cheap shot Second the proportion of hydro and the mix of other units is quite different in PJM and NYISO so the fact that

on a little readi ng I did this morning I think the answers to Sues questions are as follow s DOE has commissioned a study NTGS as part of addressing the transmis sion issues raised in the National Energy Policy NEP released in May On e of the recommendations directed to the Secretary of Energy to examine the benefits of establishing a national electrical grid identifying major tra nsmission bottlenecks and remedies to remove them It is not clear from m y reading whether the study team is internal to DOE or if a contractor is i nvolved I suspect a combination The workshops are scheduled to collect c omments from industry state government environmental groups etc the ub iquitous stakeholders The NTGS is accepting both oral and written statements with a comment portal on their website with recommendations and comments received through October A transcript of the proceedings of the workshops is to be published No other documents are mentioned on the website however I expect that a final report to recommend regulatory and market based app roaches that will stimulate new investment in our interstate bulk power tra nsmission system The goal of the study is for the respond to the NEP directive so the Secret ary of Energy is the apparent decision maker The NTGS will no doubt identify much the same information as that done for the Western Governors Association WGA during the past summer The major physical constraints in the systems are well known so the key questions a re how is investment to be made going forward and what will be don e to facilitate siting of needed transmission The first of these question s cannot be fully resolved until the future structure of the industry is kn own This in turn means the RTO debate must be resolved The NTGSs goals are best served by RTO formation the larger the better so RTOs format ion should be boosted by this effort At the same time many states are res isting the Big RTO vision of West Midwest NE SE Texas RTOs covering the whole country The states also care deeply about the second issue nam ely should the siting become a Federal responsibility as it is in gas pipel ines or should regional process be developed by the states I think most s tates acknowledge I know they do in the West that transmission siting nee ds to look beyond state borders but governors and legislatures are loathe to cede this authority to Washington DC Linda Ray or Sarah if you have better information please correct my suppo sitions We also ought to discuss the positions we should take on these ma tters in making comments at the workshops I am attaching the information I submitted for the WGA study They do not address exactly the same points as DOEs study issues but perhaps they can serve as a possible starting p oint

month in thre e cities More info is at ntgsworkshopshtml NGIs Power Market Today published September National Transmission Grid Workshops Planned When President Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy NEP in May the p lethora of recommendations included a proposal to establish a national elec tricity grid Now as the plan moves forward three workshops are scheduled this month to give all stakeholders a chance to participate in the Nationa l Transmission Grid Study NTGS The workshops set for Detroit on Se pt Atlanta on Sept and Phoenix on Sept are expected to lay th e foundation for a proposed transmission super highway As the NTGS sees it wholesale electricity market competition has changed t he way the US electric grids are used Transmission systems that historic ally were used to move power within small utility service territories are n ow frequently stressed to their limits as large blocks of power are moved on a regional basis The new patterns of power flow higher electricity de mand and a lack of investment has led to major transmission congestion acro ss the country Transmission investments go far beyond acquiring rightsofway and buildin g new power lines according to the NTGS Stateoftheart metering and t elemetry upgrading the control centers computing capabilities and installi ng new technology will also be necessary if consumers are to fully realize the efficiency gains from competitive wholesale electric markets Could the entire US electricity grid be operated as one integrated whole or a few large integrated markets If it was an integrated whole or a few l arge markets how could officials assure the reliability of a national grid Those are just a couple of the questions participants will attempt to ans wer during the workshop sessions Removing major transmission bottlenecks will help unleash the economic ben efits that are achieved through efficient and competitive electricity marke ts according to the NTGS But how to remove the bottlenecks still remains the biggest dilemma of all Investment barriers seen as keys to the puzzl e include a lack of regional integrated planning difficulty in siting an d uncertainty regarding investment risks and returns Basically the NTGS has identified several issues that will be covered in t he allday workshops including transmission planning and new capacity need s transmission siting and permitting business models for transmission inv estment and operation operation of interconnected transmission systems re liability management and oversight and new transmission technologies Within the transmission planning issue participants will discuss appropria te measures and consideration of reliability and commerce along with siting and environmental effects Other planning issues include integration of pl anning for transmission generation and demandside management programs and the role of new technologies to reduce the need for large facilities Plan ning how new transmission facilities affect the ability of some generators to artificially raise market prices for energy also will be discussed Siting and permitting issues will include input on options to establish reg ional or federal siting institutions with the authority to obtain rightsof way for new projects as well as the options to improve existing statebase d regimes Business model issues will include the political feasibility of choices for Regional Transmission Organizations as well as their effects on market efficiency system reliability operational efficiency transmissio n access and interconnection policies investment and innovation and regula tory oversight Workshop participants also will discuss who should make the decisions about reliability and the technical and economic bases for making decisions alo ng with who should take the risks The restructured industry will require a more open and inclusive process for establishing mandatory standards and monitoring and enforcing compliance according to the NTGS One way to solve many of the problems will be through new transmission tech nologies A major part of the workshops will be to learn the capability and cost of new technologies that could improve the operation of the transmiss ion system along with options available to support the development and dep loyment of new technologies in the current restructuring period The Detroit workshop set for Sept will be held at the Detroit Marriot t Romulus at Metro Airport Flynn Dr Romulus The Atlanta workshop set for Sept will be held at the Hyatt

discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

with regard to congestion management and the nature of future transmission rights Once adopted as the standard nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized approach is highly unlikely Unlike the British we have a hard time chan ging horses because of our multijurisdictional Federal system of governmen t The PJMs lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation problem If that were true they New York would have a secondary market none exists there either The unpredictability of prices is probably the biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs I think the nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful During our discussion of Seabron Adamsons last draft I maintained that a centralized unit commitment process didnt fit the Pacific Northwest PN W with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectri c and thermoelectric generation You asked me to provide more detail hydro thermal operation I am including a

EPAct was passed the usual view was that FER C could order wheeling but only on a case by case basis There had been a n effort to include an RTG provision in the bill but it died when the conf erence committee was finalizing the bill There was a view by many in the West at the time that it would still be better to move ahead with selfimp lementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation In the summ er of first WRTA Western Regional Transmission Assocation then SWRT A Southwestern Regional Transmission Association and NRTA Northwest Regi onal Transmission Association were filed They were developed in an open process that included perhaps for the first time the transmission owners the transmission dependent utilities new market entrants and state regula tors The IPPs and Marketers were participants including Enron Electric Clearing House now Dynegy DesTec CalPine Tenaska etc FERC responded in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss ion access Instead of collapsing as predicted by the just say no crowd the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions WRTA f ormed in June of While the RTGs appear rather tame today at the time they challenged the tr aditional view offering to provide open access tariffs When the FERC iss ued the NOPR that gave us Orders just prior to WRTAs formation the participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer of by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS IS With the filing of the current OATTs much of the ground breaking work of the RTGs was done but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte rface between commercial and reliablity A common planning data base was d eveloped in which included nontraditional participants and their ideas to be included The Western Market Interface Committee WMIC was organized b y the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three soon to be two RTOs proposals together When the Western RTGs were organized in they were formed outside of WS CC WSCC had a very restrictive policy allowing only utilities to be memb ers When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join it was still by halfmeasu res For instance WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend so new small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat ion When the RTG discussions were underway the good old boys wanted it i nside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions We broke that mold formed separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op en its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga nization The change passed by one vote but the change occured Once all the organizations were up and running WSCC WRTA NRTA SWRTA it was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio ns Serions talks of a merger began in about They went very slowly but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect ric Coordinating Council WECC which would merge WSCC WRTA and SWRTA tog ether initially NRTA will likely vote to merge as well WECC is a RRG as far as NERC is concerned While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked they do furthe r open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer cial impact of reliablity rules Is this a transitional phase Perhaps D oes it go as far as the EISB proposal No but I see no reason to play sm ashem bashem will every effort that hasnt followed the latest turn in our thinking As I hope this memo shows we have been evolving the industr y never as fast as Enron or others myself included have wanted it to cha nge The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to breath some life into the organization At a minimum the change from WSC CWRTASWRTANRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place Steve Original Message From Yeung Charles Sent Fri AM To Shelk John Novosel Sarah Cc Robertson Linda Nersesian Carin Walton Steve Perrino Dave Rodri quez Andy Subject RE WECC This is the first I have heard of WECC I assume it is a Western NERC t ype organization I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form ing single standards applicable to both the East and West They would howe ver like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West itself Sounds like WECC may be able to do this One of the big problems w ith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r equirements on its members as the East has tried to be At NERC WSCC mem bers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences U nfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i n the West over many transmission access practices leaving it up to the su bregions or individual TPs to decide I am not saying they are not techni cally justified but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis tent practices Is WECC consistent with EISB It depends if WECC is sovereign over any ot her organization for standards approval then I would say no I think WECC should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t hrough EISB as well The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can go directly to FERC then it becomes effectively the same as deference to the West type language we have been fighting against So my verdict on WECC depends As I noted in an earlier note I believe there are those pushing for NERC t o continue doing reliabilityonly and establish a contractual relationshi p to coordinate with EISB The WECC could take the same approach If this scenario plays out I believe customers will leave NERC and put their mone y into EISB We must then work towards making NERC merely a transmission o perators advocacy group ie EEI is transmission owners advocacy group They can exist to focus on reliability but have no direct standards set ting authority They must be a member of EISB and participate as a member in one of the market sectors If anyone has any more info on WECC please share it Charles Yeung Original Message From Shelk John Sent Friday September AM To Novosel Sarah Yeung Charles Cc Robertson Linda Nersesian Carin Subject WECC What do we think of FERCs approval of the new WECC this week As I unders tand it from the trade press this new group is a merger of the WSCC and tw o other groups The new entity will handle reliability for RTOs etc and others in the West Is this consistent with our views on reliablity EISB etc Thanks

Commission Cc After reading the FTC document I am concerned that we are loosing sight of the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser vice It will decide who uses the system how it will be used what schedu les will be accepted etc Do we really want it to set the standards by it s performance is to be judged by others There are two tendencies to guard against Most of these organizations are going to be notforprofit ISOs in form There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim ize outage risk and criticism of the RTOs management This could require the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary The opposite possiblity exists namely that they will adjust rules to cove r their own mistakes I think the former problem is the most likely If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested then the reliability rule s would have to become part of the FERC tariff In order to judge the vali dity of the reliability provisions of the tariffs the FERC will be requir ed to develop expertise it does not have In practice NERC doesnt have th e expertise either It really resides in the members of the committees and is thus derived from the industry By having a separate Standards Setting Organization the rules can still be established using the expertise of th e industry The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to complaint The SSOs governance has to be fair but I am not personally c oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight It is the service provider the RTO that needs to be independent The standards in most industries are set in this way The power of the state to enforce th e rules come from commissions of various types For instance the National Electric Code is developed by the industry but its enforcement is accompl ished by adopting it into building codes state liscensing requirements et c In the same way the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in corporated in FERCs requirement imposed on the RTO The RTOs tariff woul d incorporate them by reference If the RTOs performance violates the rule s or if a generator doesnt hold up its requirements then ADRFERC action can be taken to enforce My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service It should n ot see itself as a regulator The case of the CAISO is instructive since they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are the guardians of the public interest When the service provider thinks it regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who should have tr ansmission service rather than get on with providing it Steve Original Message From Perrino Dave

Christi L Scott Susan Walton Steve SubjectUpdate NERC Version of Legislation Rick The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC acti vities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRONNE RC team conference call John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its proposed Title on Reliability so as to look more like the PJM approach Fundamentally there are still major differences NERC continues to push f or the embodiment of deference by FERC to the SRO in the legislation Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson Dave Cook and Jef f Skilling we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug by NERC sta keholders to finalize the NERC version would impact Jeffs request to spe ak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deferenc e to NERC to become the SRO or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organi zation SSO The meeting on the th should not interfere with Jeffs ability to present issues to the Board We dont think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug meeting However for the discussions with NERC John Shelk plans to stay the line on the Enron position of kee ping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items and if Enron is appeased deference to NERC could still be given but not through legi slation rather through FERC comfort that the SSO is doing a good job B y knowing that FERC can pull the plug on the SSO if it is not satisfied this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no indus try segment dominates the standards setting process I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board Additionally Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of wh y NERC in its current form is not able to

that LMP will work Mark was caught flat footed and unprepared for Dick ONiells cheap shot Second the proportion of hydro and the mix of other units is quite different in PJM and NYISO so the fact that they fit hydro in around the edges is not necessarily proof that it will work in the PNW For that reason I have noted the mix of units hydro and base load to show that the unit committment process

miscellanous comments as well In the conclusion I know our position has always been against penalties as it relates to things like ancillary services but philosophically speaking I thought it may be beneficial to include some language which would allow the Commission some explict actions it could take if RTO compliance started on time was not met Otherwise I can just see them the commission

he will have a strategy to help the utilities avoid bankruptcy By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders would have a plan by weeks end to avert the bankruptcy of the states two biggest utilities by trading ratepayerbacked bond money for utility assets The dropdead date is clearly Feb Davis said That is when a federal judge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison joined by Pacific Gas Electric that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumers unless a rescue plan is in place Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get control of the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give the utilities a cash infusion But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid said he did not share Davis urgency to cut a deal this week The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of what likely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent power generators sell electricity in California The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order Were not even asking Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced power generators to keep electricity flowing to California even though Edison and PGE were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California has relieved the utilities of having to buy powerat a cost to taxpayers of roughly million a day Davis meanwhile plans to announce today that California has entered into its first longterm contracts to buy power from independent generators thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets At least one firm Calpine Corp was on the verge late Monday of signing a deal to provide the state with up to megawatts for roughly years One megawatt is enough to serve roughly homes The cost could not be determined but it is believed to be slightly above the cents per kilowatthour that Davis had hoped for Clearly we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem or do something to bail us out Davis said at a Capitol news conference Monday We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship Were not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass Were going to solve it ourselves Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders this week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing a cash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable in exchange for utility assets The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help the financially hobbled companies It may sell bonds or guarantee bonds that the utilities might sell Either way the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay down their debt estimated at between billion and billion It cannot be done without assistance from the state Davis said Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid Davis supports taking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants similar to stock options The warrants could be cashed in after the utilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricity for consumers or to soften future rate hikes That state assistance no matter what form it comes in has a value Davis said It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives in return has comparable value Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future The bonds would be purchased by investors who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers By selling bonds the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers for the high prices of electricity in the first year or two But consumers will pay higher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to drop as more power plants are built In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future Davis said the state likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost of power State Treasurer Phil Angelides who will oversee the bond process said in an interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for future power purchases But he said resolving the past debts of the utilities is a tougher problem There is no magic money here Bonds require a repayment source Angelides said It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their own reorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance At the end of the day if there are some assets of value that we are interested in as a buyer that should be on the table Edison and PGE have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paid record high prices for wholesale power yet were unable to pass on the full cost of it to consumers On Monday a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edisons suit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allow the utilities to pass on the multibilliondollar cost of buying power Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek among the lawmakers most involved in the Legislatures response to the energy crisis said that if utilities win the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their power purchases consumers could be hit with an rate increase I dont think we can roll the dice and let that happen said Keeley who along with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks has been pushing for an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit However Burton the Legislatures most influential member shrugged off the Monday deadline Trial courts rule Appellate courts rule Supreme Courts rule and its three or four years down the road Burton said In other developments Monday Davis again used his emergency authority to claim million worth of contracts held by PGE shortly before they would have been taken by one of the utilitys creditors PGE had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange and the entity a sort of commodities market for electricity wanted to auction off the contracts Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday The PGE contracts will supply between and megawatts of electricity for the remainder of The price of the power will be determined in proceedings before the state Board of Control But the state may find itself paying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in the contracts Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by a creditor General ReFinancial Products Corp which contends it is owed million for early termination of a financial arrangement during the utilitys debt crisis Edison said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission to attach the account to reverse course and stop the action The account with a New York bank contains million Edison said Edison noted in the same filing that it had billion in cash on Monday but has defaulted on several million dollars worth of debt payments and has deferred payments totaling million through Monday to electricity suppliers If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity payments as they came due it would have run out of cash last Friday Edison said In contrast its parent company Edison International is paying all of its bills Shares of Edison International rose cents to close at per share Monday and PGE Corp fell cents to close at per share Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors a large credit rating agency reaffirmed that Californias strong

in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading

System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set

resist any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to consider supporting a day ahead market Market separation rules MSR ISO is leaning towards option in which SCs submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after congestion process is conducted ie final schedules may be imbalanced What do we think of this

The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion The pane lists were Jose DegadoCEO American Transmission Company Michael Dworkin Chair Vermont PSC Mark MaherVP Transmission Business Line Bonneville Power Administration Lara ManzPSEG Masheed RosenqvistNational Grid Steve WaltonEnron General Observations The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t ime to time Commissioners Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q uestioning The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi al presentations moving along the discussion by asking questions There w as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management howev er there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss ion rights There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market wh ere are problems how might they be solved etc and that the where possib le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit Ther e was a good deal of discussion of least cost planning and the identifica tion of options which are not transmission related All agreed there had t o be backstop authority to build transmission however then the challenge i s who pays for it which raises the need for dispute resolution Opening Statements Jose Delgado ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op erator They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met They were formed by divestiture by IOUS coops and munis and with a million asset base initially Their current ten year plan will add billion of in vestment Their top priorities are connecting generation and load Michael Dworkin Because transmission is a common good construction affect s all parties not just one party The environmental and permitting of line s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view The ide a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multistate project s although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us ed by FCC State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered Mark Maher FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations RTO West is developing a planning pro cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process Laura Manz The various aspects of planning are connected Pricing LMP i s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re sources No competitor should have an advantage over another The RTO ne eds a central planning process but it shouldnt push solutions The market should decide on solutions Masheed Rosenqvist The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk The planning discussion is not about what we h ave now but about how to avoid future congestion The Commission has take n conflicting positions in different cases The issues that need to be ans wered are How can merchant transmission be compensated Should transmiss ion projects be open to RFPs Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp ansions Steve Walton The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h as frozen transmission investment The RTO debate has been going on for years or more and needs to be settled For expansion to go forward there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party Y ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning For instance if a kV line is all that is needed to day but future considerations of scare rightofway say a kV line should be built who pays for the extra cost In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis pute resolution process appeal able to FERC to decide such matters Discussion Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution ie least cost planning This lead to discuss ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was a under built and needed lots of expansion so dont worry about overbuilding or b transmiss ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit ies The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions L aura Manz felt that the term under built is a secondary effect of not hav ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties Dick ONeil asked if LMP will work in the West Mark Maher said it wouldn t Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics they manage h ydro facilities in PJM Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n ot to be rejected just intelligently designed BPA is looking pricing mode l but LMP wont work Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some twea ks like bilaterals and allow operator selfschedule output levels to permi t river coordination Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis PJM has hydro but not as in the Northwest Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a nd base load coal In the summation at the end of the panel four principles were listed RTO must provide information RTO should identify solutions RTO s hould be unbiased and the RTO should be accountable The disagreement was over the last two points Michael Dworkin felt that unbiased was c ritical and that accountability was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance Jose Delgado said and Transco cant be unbiased si nce it provides services although the ISO above it can be but accountabil ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues Steve

any mandatory DayAhead Market The results for dayahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to influence price in the dayahead market In PJM and NYISO parties submit false load and generation schedules in set price most often this is a low ball load estimatethen later the true load is scheduled I think there is less of a problem with the hourahead market since the opportunity to submit a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not nonexistent Unbalance Schedules The general direction we are going for Eastern ISOs is to allow unbalance schedules in the realtime market Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he still wants this feature Normally there would be no imbalance penalties however when reserve margins are so slim that the systems security is in jeopardy penalties would be triggered The result is that parties can choose to use the realtime market or they can choose bilateral schedules or a combination They are not compelled to do either As long as reserves are adequate then why should we care Unit Commitment Although not on your list I think the primary problems that the DayAhead Market is trying to solve is unit commitment While this may be the intended purpose it hasnt worked very well Centralized unit commitment would address the problem but then the operator decisions have a large impact on prices without having any consequences We need a proposal for making sure that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in place A possible approach may be as follows as suggested by Mike Roan The Operator publishes its expected realtime price for the next hours based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and bid price one part and the ISOs estimate of hourly loads The estimates roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to all market participants The Operator provides the demandsupply curves to the market so everyone has the same information As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted the estimate of realtime prices changes providing signals for units to use in deciding to commit units As expected price rises more units are committed and price goes down At a given point in time such as hours ahead of realtime the Operator locks units in as committed If there are inadequate units committed it pays to add capacity call contracts If not enough is voluntarily bid the Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in interconnectionintegration agreements with the generators The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost of imbalance energy in realtime for the hours for which those costs were incurred This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach which provides signals and information to the market It or some other procedure like it is needed to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a notforprofit ISO Steve Alan Comnes PM To james d nron cc Subject CAISO Market Stabilization Plant Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market stabilization plan which is attached Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points for media advocacy folks In addition to reviewing the plan I listened in to part of a stakeholder call that occured Friday am PST DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS With limited exceptions the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease demand It primarily addresses costs and market stability INTERESTING QUOTES Over the edge into cost based regulation Duke Power Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market stability whatever that means the ISO staffer Byron Wortz who presented the study admitted it Will do nothing to increase supply this summer A staffer Lorenzo stated paraphrased all out of state suppliers are cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates ON SPECIFICS The Ugly Resourcespecific cost based bid caps RSBC or bid caps cost of service regulation that disincent supply The ISO will hold instate resources hostagecuts any exports when reserves fall below a stated critera Imports can only participate as price takers Thus if the highestcost instate resource is below the opportunity cost of power needed imports will not come in this will decrease supply Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign longer term deals if necessary to secure outofstate power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work The Bad The ISO is considering pay as bid which is complex and does not increase supply However on the call they said they are leaing to a single price auction However with bid caps the market will still be distorted The Good The ISO wll implement an hourly dayahead and hourahead market essentially filling a void created by the PXs demise Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we want to

D nron Jeff NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Cost of Protectionism Jeff In order for California to shut its doors it must open its interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue

the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue

he will have a strategy to help the utilities avoid bankruptcy By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders would have a plan by weeks end to avert the bankruptcy of the states two biggest utilities by trading ratepayerbacked bond money for utility assets The dropdead date is clearly Feb Davis said That is when a federal judge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison joined by Pacific Gas Electric that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumers unless a rescue plan is in place Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get control of the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give the utilities a cash infusion But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid said he did not share Davis urgency to cut a deal this week The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of what likely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent power generators sell electricity in California The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order Were not even asking Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced power generators to keep electricity flowing to California even though Edison and PGE were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California has relieved the utilities of having to buy powerat a cost to taxpayers of roughly million a day Davis meanwhile plans to announce today that California has entered into its first longterm contracts to buy power from independent generators thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets At least one firm Calpine Corp was on the verge late Monday of signing a deal to provide the state with up to megawatts for roughly years One megawatt is enough to serve roughly homes The cost could not be determined but it is believed to be slightly above the cents per kilowatthour that Davis had hoped for Clearly we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem or do something to bail us out Davis said at a Capitol news conference Monday We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship Were not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass Were going to solve it ourselves Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders this week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing a cash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable in exchange for utility assets The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help the financially hobbled companies It may sell bonds or guarantee bonds that the utilities might sell Either way the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay down their debt estimated at between billion and billion It cannot be done without assistance from the state Davis said Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid Davis supports taking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants similar to stock options The warrants could be cashed in after the utilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricity for consumers or to soften future rate hikes That state assistance no matter what form it comes in has a value Davis said It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives in return has comparable value Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future The bonds would be purchased by investors who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers By selling bonds the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers for the high prices of electricity in the first year or two But consumers will pay higher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to drop as more power plants are built In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future Davis said the state likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost of power State Treasurer Phil Angelides who will oversee the bond process said in an interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for future power purchases But he said resolving the past debts of the utilities is a tougher problem There is no magic money here Bonds require a repayment source Angelides said It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their own reorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance At the end of the day if there are some assets of value that we are interested in as a buyer that should be on the table Edison and PGE have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paid record high prices for wholesale power yet were unable to pass on the full cost of it to consumers On Monday a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edisons suit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allow the utilities to pass on the multibilliondollar cost of buying power Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek among the lawmakers most involved in the Legislatures response to the energy crisis said that if utilities win the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their power purchases consumers could be hit with an rate increase I dont think we can roll the dice and let that happen said Keeley who along with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks has been pushing for an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit However Burton the Legislatures most influential member shrugged off the Monday deadline Trial courts rule Appellate courts rule Supreme Courts rule and its three or four years down the road Burton said In other developments Monday Davis again used his emergency authority to claim million worth of contracts held by PGE shortly before they would have been taken by one of the utilitys creditors PGE had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange and the entity a sort of commodities market for electricity wanted to auction off the contracts Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday The PGE contracts will supply between and megawatts of electricity for the remainder of The price of the power will be determined in proceedings before the state Board of Control But the state may find itself paying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in the contracts Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by a creditor General ReFinancial Products Corp which contends it is owed million for early termination of a financial arrangement during the utilitys debt crisis Edison said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission to attach the account to reverse course and stop the action The account with a New York bank contains million Edison said Edison noted in the same filing that it had billion in cash on Monday but has defaulted on several million dollars worth of debt payments and has deferred payments totaling million through Monday to electricity suppliers If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity payments as they came due it would have run out of cash last Friday Edison said In contrast its parent company Edison International is paying all of its bills Shares of Edison International rose cents to close at per share Monday and PGE Corp fell cents to close at per share Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors a large credit rating agency reaffirmed that Californias strong rating remains on its Credit Watch Negative list following Thursdays passage by the Legislature of a bill giving the state Department of Water Resources million more to buy electricity for the state
