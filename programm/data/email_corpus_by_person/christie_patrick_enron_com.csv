scheduled to participate in In case it doesnt ring a bell we discussed it briefly at the end of August The Conference is part of our year Reasearch relationship with Stanford entitled Globe The conference is set for January rd at Stanford There will be Keynote speakers and panels Global Ethics Global Brand and Global Growth Steve is part of The Global Ethics panelit should be fairly easy and straight forward as described below Steve if you have changed your mind about participating please let me know as soon as possible so I can discuss it with Stanford If it works with your schedule I agree with what Beth says below and think it would be a very good opportunity for us especially at this time Please let me know Thanks Christie Original Message From Benjamin Beth mailto Sent Friday November PM To Subject GLOBE Conference schedule Christie Hello I imagine youre quite busy given all the changes going on at Enron Im dropping you a line for a couple of reasons First and most important I wanted to send along some good wishes during what I imagine is a difficult time I hope you and those around you are coping well and that your spirit is as strong and positive as ever Second Im attaching the schedule for the January GLOBE conference Steve Keans panel will take place which should allow him time to fly in and out easily on the same day Theres a lot of enthusiasm about his participation and I think this is a great time to have someone from Enron in front of the MBAs He will be in good and very empathetic company as Maria Eitel NIKE and Mads Ovlisen Novo Nordisk have both led their companies through some difficult times facing more than their share of public scrutiny We are working with the panel moderator David Brady to outline some specific questions that members of the panel might wish to consider in preparing their remarks Our goal is to have each panelist share their own company experiences essentially sharing the ethical challenges their company has faced as theyve expanded globally across different cultures and legal regimes How have they balanced the responsibility to make a profit with that of being a good corporate citizen in places where corporate citizenship may mean very different things Again each speaker will have approximately ten minutes each in which to relay their experiences after which the moderate will ask some questions and then ultimately open it up for audience questions As I hope is evident we are quite excited that Steve is taking part in the conference I will plan to send you the topic outline shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday Please let me know if youd prefer that I send it to Steve directly otherwise I will continue to send information through you All the best Beth Benjamin Director
