article in case you missed it It covers the risks inherent in processing trade transactions and discusses solutions such as automation and using standards Nothing new here It does however advocate outsourcing mid and back office services to independent third party vendors such as Houstonbased Confirmation Clearing Corp Its worth the read Original Message From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESdjcustomclipsdjinteractiveEcom NRONcom Sent Thursday April PM To Subject Fred Philipson Deal confirmation Weak link in the risk management chain No matter how fast Global Energy Business Copyright McGrawHill Inc According to The New York Times on March of this year a broker misplaced the decimal point while executing an order on the Nasdaq stock exchange A day trader who thought he had made a profit of later discovered he had actually lost Although all the systems executing the trade were electronic the error was made by a human This anecdote should strike a nerve at energy trading firms which spend the bulk of their time trying to quantify and manage the risks they take One of the first and most valuable lessons they learned about risk management came courtesy of Nick Leeson the rogue trader who brought down the investment bank Barings in the mid s That lesson was You cant control risk unless you separate your front and back offices However the careers of many energy traders begin in the back office Managers believe that if a kid makes a mistake there at least it wont bring down the company But although online energy exchanges have increased the velocity and volume of trading theyve done nothing to reduce the amount of work involved in confirming deals Confirmation is still a manual paperdriven process of verifying signatures and assembling evidentiary documents to support deals While the front office turns to fancier and more powerful analytical software and the middle office deploys stateoftheart risk management systems life in the back office continues to test humans tolerance for tedium The importance of deal confirmation cannot be overstated In addition to being a legal and binding act confirmation serves as the last opportunity to prevent a deal from being transacted wrongly As transaction volumes rise so do the opportunities for introducing human error during the deal confirmation process Confirmation represents a potential source of operational risk that cannot be hedged Zero tolerance When asked what he considers the biggest offense a trader could make Jim Donnell CEO of Houstonbased Duke Energy North America answered without hesitation doing a deal and not recording it He says hed even fire a trader for being that sloppy The only thing worse adds Greg Hickl head power trader for Tulsabased Williams Energy would be if a trader tries to hide a trading mistake At energy trading firms mistakes have little chance of remaining covered up for long If their electronic systems are working correctly both the middle and back offices should receive a confirmation from the broker or counterparty for every deal made But when markets are volatile Hickl explains honest mistakes are more likely to happen and the back office may have a difficult time catching them The proliferation of streamlined systems that enable a trade to be entered in seconds or less and generate its own confirmation are giving front offices more control over the risks inherent in the use of manual backroom processes Its important to realize that although process automation and systems integration can mitigate confirmation risk they cannot eliminate itbecause humans are still involved in the process Once two traders make a deal the middle or back office of their companies still must contact each other to confirm its details Go with the deal flow Although the front middle and back offices have slightly different responsibilities at different energy trading firms this is not evident to the outside world All energy traders do business in much the same way Figure At most trading houses trades are made and enteredcaptured in other wordsin the front office by traders their analysts assistants deal input clerks or even by a pool of dealcapture specialists Trade capture is important for several reasons for correct invoicing proper risk control and acknowledging intent to pay Depending on the type of deal see table the confirmation desk will either phone or fax the counterparty to confirm it wait to receive a confirmation from the other party or initiate a confirmation If the deal was done on an online exchange the confirmation desk will also check to see that the exchange recorded the transaction If a trade has a physical component the sellers scheduling desk also plays a role by nominating or scheduling the flow of energy A steep learning curve As mentioned neophytes may comprise much of the staff of backroom confirmation desks They have a lot to learn back there including the jargon of the industry and the difference between floating and fixedprice deals It helps if these entrylevel personnel are quick studies because in many ways energy trading is more complicated than financial trading In financial markets no more than currencies or interest rates comprise the universe of traded commodities In equity markets there are thousands of stocks but no forward market with the exception of equity options In the North American gas market by contrast there may be basis locations each trading two years out at any time Newcomers also have to learn to handle options thousands of price points specifying delivery location and time period and deals for transmission and storage capacity If the market has high volatility large notional values large transaction volumes low margins and long settlement cyclesas physical energy markets dothe dangers of using antiquated processes are far greater than in financial markets which trade in virtual money The physical nature of commodity electricity raises the complexity of trading it to another level In the US electricity is specified on an hourly basis In the UK its halfhourly In Germany its every minutes Volumes and prices must be specified for each time slot In physical deals the high penalties for throwing the delivery systems out of balance behoove counterparties to capture and confirm deals with great accuracy To err is human As the transaction volume and volatility of a market increase so do the chances of making a mistake and the penalties for doing so Mistakes can be made when a trade is made when it is entered into the system when it is confirmed when energy is delivered and even as late as when a payment is made Modern electronic trading systems incorporate many checks and balances to help catch human errors but some still slip through The manual process of deal confirmation is particularly errorprone because it may require the handling and matching of media as different as paper faxes tapes of phone conversations and electronic files Exacerbating the problem there is no industrystandard confirmation form Nothing prevents a trading firm from burying a paragraph of legalese at the bottom of its document which is why traders like to hire people for the back office with a strong attention to detail Ironically paper fax and verbal confirmations are still the preferred media as email is still not considered secure enough Even the simplest deal may generate three to five faxed pages for confirmation purposes Because energy trading is so complex and demands such high accuracy deal confirmation is a stressful job One trader reports that the people who do deal confirmation at his firm dread hearing from the firms traders because they only call when someone in the back office makes a mistake Some companies try to reduce the stress by distributing the confirmation workload throughout the day But at most others the rule remains hard and fast All transactions of the previous day must be confirmed by noon the next day To catch an error divine How successful are humans at catching errors made at the dealconfirmation stage It depends One top trading firmwhose confirmation desk is staffed by new hires that typically last only last six months on the jobestimates that as many as two out of every five deals it makes contain an error of some kind Anotherwhich entrusts this task to moresenior personnelestimates a error rate But this does not include spot deals which start the next day Unlike market risk which can be managed the operational risk related to errors in deal confirmation cannot be hedged in ways other than building a wall between the front and back offices endless checking and rechecking and using good personnel and procedure management practices Money is also a factor in dealing with confirmation errors If a firm fires someone who makes a mistake it will then have to spend many times that to train someone else to do his or her job Legal risks Rather than wait to receive deal confirmations some traders initiate them both for legal reasons and to exert greater control over the process There are two types of confirmations in use today positive and negative A positive confirmation requires both parties to agree that a trade has been made between them and that the trade meets agreedupon specifications A negative confirmation by contrast presumes that the other party has agreed to the deal unless it is notified to the contrary by a certain date and time This practice which speeds up the confirmation process and therefore enables increases in transaction volume is the norm at online exchanges EnronOnline for instance automatically sends a confirming fax to every party with whom it does a deal If it fails to receive a response to the contrary within a certain number of business days Enron assumes that the deal is confirmed The main problem with negative confirmation is that it allows a counterparty that spots a mistake in its favor to keep quiet about the error Toward automation Several vendors of trading software have added automatic deal confirmation to the list of features of their integrated product suites Among them is Houstonbased Altra Technologies whose vice president David Hanson explains that Automatic trade confirmation is the first step on the road to straightthrough processing Trading firms have begun to take notice of straightthrough processing or STP a term that implies the removal of humans from all points along the dealprocessing chain for obvious reasons Lesscostly and morepowerful integrated systems and middleware will doubtless foster the proliferation of STP allowing more traders to automate their existing manual dealconfirmation processes However the complete automation of energy trading industrywide will still require standardization All market participantsincluding their legal departmentswill have to agree on a common format and procedures for confirming deals STPthe traders edge In addition to eliminating human confirmation errors another big benefit of STP is that it promises to enable energy traders to do more trades of greater complexity more quickly The nomination and confirmation processes being put in place in the UK in preparation for the shift to the New Electricity Trading Arrangements NETA this spring are a good example of how complex and timecritical energy trading is becoming Under the new rules electricity schedules will be defined on a halfhourly basis and all time slots in the day must be specified by volume and price in a twohour time window from to pm Oliver Mills vice president of European sales for New Yorkbased Caminus believes that it will be impossible for traders to meet these time constraints while doing to deals a day unless they automate their business processes So Caminus has added a matching engine called ZGrid to its ZaiNet software suite Based on a subset of XML standards ZGrid replaces fax confirmations and shows an audit trail of all information exchanged between buyer and seller The system obviously works when both counterparties have ZGrid but it also works when the party on the other end has trading software that is compatible with the socalled Enron Spec Developed by Enron this specificationalso called the Group of Seven specis supported by the seven leading participants in the new UK energy market The spec itself delineates the physical format of and procedures for executing a trade Another software vendor targeting the nascent dealautomation market is TradeCapturecom based in Stamford Conn According to Chief Marketing Officer Matt Frye the companys Integrated Commodity Trading System ICTS automatically updates a trading firms internal records of scheduled confirmed and actual shipments giving it both a realtime and a historical view of its positions The system can initiate the sending of dealconfirming electronic files faxes and telexes Altras David Hanson hits the nail on the head in describing automated trade confirmation as the first step on the road to STP After a deal is confirmed it must still be cleared and settled Two new companies say they have found a way to automate those processes too One is Houstonbased EnergyClear which says it is the first industrysponsored clearinghouse to offer comparison netting and settlement of wholesale energy contracts to overthecounter OTC energy traders Cofounder and president Lee Burton believes EnergyClear will revolutionize the OTC energy markets by reducing traders credit legal operational and liquidity risks which in the long run will increase those markets depth and liquidity Counterparties must still confirm their deals however before turning to EnergyClear The other new firm eyeing OTC energy marketsand other OTC commodity markets as wellis NexClear Inc Boulder Colo The company says it will soon be offering centralized clearing fulfillment and delivery services to all OTCtraded commodity markets In addition it will also guarantee transactions monitor credit risk provide trade data and perform necessary middle and backoffice services The NexClear system will allow traders to use the Web to enter details of their trades in a confirmation window Outsource to ease risk Checking the details of deals more diligently and automating the confirmation process are only two approaches that energy traders can take to minimize their operational risk Another is to hire a third party to guarantee that unforeseen events wont cause financial paina practice akin to buying insurance A company that offers such a service to energy trading companies is Houstonbased Confirmation Clearing Corp CCC Founder and President Chris Papousek advises that A good way to test the readiness of an organization to cope with a counterparty default is to run an occasional fire drillto expose gaps in processes that can then be filled when the clock isnt ticking He urges energy trading firms to consider using an independent third partysuch as CCCto eliminate the legal risks of deal confirmation If both parties to a deal are subscribers to the companys service they would send their version of its details to CCC and have CCC do the work of matching and confirmation Both would be covered against errors and omissions by the equivalent of an insurance policy Figure shows how the service works Note the connections to EnergyClear and NexClear which are responsible for clearing and settlement Papousek believes that a confirmation service such as the one his company offers can work only if it is centralized independently owned and works in real time with all commodity markets and trading platforms The last thing you want in the confirmation arena
