email types the words SIGNOFF RRGAL Make sure there is NO OTHER TEXT AT ALL in the body of the email you send such as a sender signature This will take you off the list My apologies for the inconvenience and annoyance Sarah Original Message From Shauna McReynolds NUCCORG To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Sent Tuesday May PM Please remove me from this mailing list Thank you Date sent Tue May Send reply to RTO West Regional Representatives Group RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG From Dalia Keith A TOSDITT PAGOV To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest form If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings just issue a SET RRGAL DIGEST command Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list through the use of the REVIEW command which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers If you do not want your name to be visible just issue a SET RRGAL CONCEAL command More information on LISTSERV commands can be found in the LISTSERV reference card which you can retrieve by sending an INFO REFCARD command to ISTRTOWESTORG Shauna McReynolds PNUCC ph fx

list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options

the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest

Energy Marketing LP Perimeter Center West Atlanta GA Phone Fax Cell Email Jack irantcom Original Message From Dalia Keith A TOSDITT mailto PAGOV Sent Tuesday May PM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Subject You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY

you Sarah Original Message From NickesonMoore Nikki UGETCOM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Sent Tuesday May PM Please remove my name from future mailings Kimberly Harris of Puget Sound Energy should be receiving all information relating to RTO Thanks From Dalia Keith A TOSDITTSMTP PAGOV Reply To RTO West Regional Representatives Group Sent Tuesday May PM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest form If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings just issue a SET RRGAL DIGEST command Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list through the use of the REVIEW command which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers If you do not want your name to be visible just issue a SET RRGAL CONCEAL command More

Pyburn Jr Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP Perimeter Center West Atlanta GA Phone Fax Cell Email Jack irantcom Original Message From Dalia Keith A TOSDITT mailto PAGOV Sent Tuesday May PM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Subject You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the

consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest form If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings just issue a SET RRGAL DIGEST command Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list through the use of the REVIEW command which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers If you do not want your name to be visible just issue a SET RRGAL CONCEAL command More information on LISTSERV commands can be found in the LISTSERV reference card which you can retrieve by sending an INFO REFCARD command to ISTRTOWESTORG

ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO

save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest form If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings just issue a SET RRGAL DIGEST command Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list through the use of the REVIEW command which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers If you do not want your name to be visible just issue a SET RRGAL CONCEAL command More information on LISTSERV commands can be found in the LISTSERV reference card which you can retrieve by sending an INFO REFCARD command to ISTRTOWESTORG File ATThtm

Thanks Margie Original Message From Sarah DennisonLeonard ARTHLINKNET To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Sent Tuesday May PM To get off the list please send an email to ISTRTOWESTORG and in the subject line please put SIGNOFF RRGAL Thank you Sarah Original Message From Pyburn Jack R jack IRANTCOM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Sent Tuesday May PM Im not sure how I got on this list but Id like to be deleted Thanks Jack Pyburn Jr Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP Perimeter Center West Atlanta GA Phone Fax Cell Email Jack irantcom Original Message From Dalia Keith A TOSDITT mailto PAGOV Sent Tuesday May PM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG Subject You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest form If you wish to receive the digested version of the postings just issue a SET RRGAL DIGEST command Please note that it is presently possible for other people to determine that you are signed up to the list through the use of the REVIEW command which returns the email address and name of all the subscribers If you do not want your name to be visible just issue a SET RRGAL CONCEAL command More information on LISTSERV commands can be found in the LISTSERV reference card which you can retrieve by sending an INFO REFCARD command to ISTRTOWESTORG

receiving all information relating to RTO Thanks From Dalia Keith A TOSDITTSMTP PAGOV Reply To RTO West Regional Representatives Group Sent Tuesday May PM To RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG You have been added to the RRGAL mailing list RTO West Congestion Model Content Group by Keith Dalia PAGOV Please save this message for future reference especially if this is the first time you subscribe to an electronic mailing list If you ever need to leave the list you will find the necessary instructions below Perhaps more importantly saving a copy of this message and of all future subscription notices from other mailing lists in a special mail folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you are subscribed to This may prove very useful the next time you go on vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up your mailbox while you are away You should also save the welcome messages from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after subscribing to a new list To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list just send mail to RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG This is called sending mail to the list because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed This address RRGA ISTRTOWESTORG is also called the list address You must never try to send any command to that address as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed All commands must be sent to the LISTSERV address ISTRTOWESTORG It is very important to understand the difference between the two but fortunately it is not complicated The LISTSERV address is like a FAX number that connects you to a machine whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again No harm will have been done If on the other hand you accidentally make your FAX call someones voice line the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced especially if your FAX then redials every minutes The fact that most people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow the FAX to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send FAXes to the voice number People would just get mad at you It works pretty much the same way with mailing lists with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address You may leave the list at any time by sending a SIGNOFF RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can also tell LISTSERV how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list If you do not trust the system send a SET RRGAL REPRO command and LISTSERV will send you a copy of your own messages so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way After a while you may find that this is getting annoying especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from RRGAL If you send a SET RRGAL ACK NOREPRO command LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead which will look different in your mailbox directory With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later Finally you can turn off acknowledgements completely with SET RRGAL NOACK NOREPRO Following instructions from the list owner your subscription options have been set to NOFILES REPRO rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults For more information about subscription options send a QUERY RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived You can get a list of the available archive files by sending an INDEX RRGAL command to ISTRTOWESTORG You can then order these files with a GET RRGAL LOGxxxx command or using LISTSERVs database search facilities Send an INFO DATABASE command for more information on the latter This list is available in digest
