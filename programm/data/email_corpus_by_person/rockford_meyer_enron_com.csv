pollution problems at Gannon Rock Forwarded by Rockford MeyerFGTEnron on PM From David Rosenberg on PM To Rockford NRON cc James NRON Subject Letters from Tampa Paper Regarding TECO conversion Good and Bad Couldnt remember if I had passed along copies of these letters to the editor from the Tampa Tribune Dec PM TECO is trying to do the right thing JOHN RAMIL At Tampa Electric were trying to do the right thing Our goal is a challenging one to meet the needs of our customers and operate a financially sound business in an environmentally responsible way Even those with extreme viewpoints should agree that achieving a balance like this is never easy But in our billion agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection we believe weve found a way As with any major shift in thinking the road to our environmental plan has been far from simple Since early we have spent many many hours in negotiation with two federal agencies each perhaps with different objectives In our dialogue with EPA and the Department of Justice we invested a great deal of time and energy trying to find common ground on which to develop a longrange environmental strategy for our company When this did not happen the state of Florida stepped in as was its right and duty as the agency with primary responsibility for implementation and enforcement of the environmental emission standards in question As an agency ready to act DEP helped us craft an agreement that actually takes us further than any of our negotiations with the federal entities As a result Tampa Electric has accomplished what we originally set out to do with the EPA our nitrogen oxide emissions will drop by percent by the year from levels Using as the starting point the ultimate reductions in nitrogen oxide will exceed percent These reductions are significant on their own but even more so when you consider that Tampa Electric must simultaneously generate almost percent more electricity for our customers over the same time period But the federal government has said it is still not satisfied They want penalties In fact that may be what this case is all about This is a dramatic departure from EPAs position stated on Nov when they announced their suit against utilities around the country Then they said the purpose of the lawsuit was not to penalize but to improve the air Thats exactly what Tampa Electric is doing with the direction of the DEP in a way that balances the environment our customers and our employees Were also a little confused as to why Hillsborough EPC chief Roger Stewart has criticized this landmark plan Two years ago when we announced a voluntary plan in concert with EPC to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by percent Stewart was enthusiastic in his support Now a much higher percent reduction draws his criticism Like any business we have many stakeholders for whose interests we are concerned The environment is a critical one but it is still one of many We must also consider the effect of any major capital expenditures on our customers rates and we must make those expenditures in a way that is fiscally sound so that we can continue to deliver reliable and economical electricity to meet our communitys growing energy needs The billion commitment we have pledged to environmental improvements represents a huge expenditure particularly for a company with billion in overall assets Yet we recognize the positive impact environmental improvements will have for our other stakeholders including our customers in the Tampa Bay area Toward this end we are excited to have found a way to undertake the largest environmental cleanup effort Florida has seen in the last quartercentury Were proud of what we will accomplish on behalf of Floridas environment while keeping our prices low and our service high That we believe is the right thing to do an PM Now for the Negative Side from January On Nov the US Environmental Protection Agency brought a lawsuit against Tampa Electric Co for violations of the Clean Air Act EPA claims TECO made illegal major changes to its Big Bend and Gannon power plants The changes allowed TECO to extend the operating life of two of the nations dirtiest power plants and to produce more electricity and more air pollution without necessary permits On Dec the Florida Department of Environmental Protection filed and settled a state lawsuit against TECO involving those same actions Florida DEP Secretary David Struhs in his Dec guest column Commentary makes finesounding arguments about why the TECO deal is good for Florida However the agreement DEP made doesnt match Struhs description only three of six Gannon units built between and years ago will close units that were never built to run more than years The DEP agreement has many loopholes for TECO to slip through Most important of the many conditions is that the Florida Public Service Commission must allow TECO to recover all its expenses for compliance from its customers Struhs defends allowing TECO to keep sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission credits the former have a current value of about per ton and can be sold to other utilities The agreement allows both credits to be used by TECO in the future instead of requiring the utility to further reduce its pollution And Struhs doesnt address the fact that the agreement protects TECO from having to comply with new air pollution standards for the next years What is lost in Struhs version of the deal is that a basic principle of government enforcement is to remove the reward the violator has reaped from its illegal action TECO has overhauled obsolete plants overpolluted and profited financially by its actions The DEP deal doesnt come close to evening the score Struhs makes much of punitive payments totaling million going to Florida rather than Washington But million to study Tampa Bay pollution and million to research technologies TECO might use are not punitive and are grossly inadequate compared with the benefit TECO received through its actions And its TECO customers not those responsible for the violations who will pay Legislation now before Congress would require electric utilities such as TECO to actually reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide percent by limit mercury by percent and reduce carbon dioxide emissions for the first time Floridas congressional delegation including representatives from the Tampa Bay region needs to get serious about air pollution Smog and fine particles are health threats that can no longer be ignored Valuable natural resources such as Tampa Bay are at risk from air pollution that is nearby and is washed into the bay Air pollution is both a local and national problem Secretary Struhs has demonstrated that we cant trust our state officials to protect our health from power plant pollution We need real reductions sooner rules or agreements with real teeth Maybe its time for a national solution GAIL KAMARAS Tallahassee The writer is director of the Energy Advocacy Program of the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation TECO is the dirtiest plant in the nation It has had years to achieve compliance but attempts to strike another good ol boy deal to get another years to pollute but the feds object and try to protect locals The water management district the term is not really descriptive of what it does voted to put the largest desalination plant near Big Bend plant Both members of the Hillsborough County Commission in the group voted against it but the majority representing water needs from Pasco and Pinellas County dont want it in their areas because it may not leave room for more development They voted to put it in our area with promises of no impact on the bay or canals A new wallboard plant is planned for a location near the Big Bend TECO plant and the desalination plant Company officials also promise no pollution will leave the site And oh by the way they will need lots of water Cargill announces that it needs to double the size of its gypsum stack in order to operate for the next years The company says there is no danger to the environment A consortium of phosphate companies has now announced that they want to put a liquidsulfur plant near Big Bend Again promises of no odor or pollutants leaving the site And again they will need more water My questions are Who if anyone is studying the cumulative effects of all these actions What plans are being made to ensure that there is no odor and that emissions do not leave the site What protection is being included in the permits to ensure an immediate clean up response and shutdown of the facility in case of an accident I do not believe there is anyone doing these things from a wholecommunity perspective The addition of the few jobs that will be created by this potentially disastrous collection of industries does not justify the potential damage to the bay our community and our childrens future Enough is enough RICHARD CLOY Apollo Beach Since Southwest Florida Water Management District has held monthly preapplication meetings on the Cone Ranch Dispersed Wells Project for Tampa Bay Water staff and consultants During these meetings new information related to this hotly debated wellfield are discussed and Tampa Bay Water gains a better understanding of what will be required to obtain a pumping permit for the Cone Ranch wellfield Citizens who organized in opposition to the Cone Ranch project were successful in obtaining the consultantprepared preapplication meeting notes approved by all attendees of the preapplication meetings Unfortunately the notes contain repetitive text missing and incorrect meeting dates apparent text deletions and poor definition of action items and responsibilities In response to complaints about the lack of detail and accuracy Tampa Bay Water responded that the reports were intended only to provide summaries of important discussion points and that the summaries were accurate In effect these accurate summaries prevented concerned citizens from sequentially reconstructing permitting developments at Cone Ranch and thereby limited public participation in the process On Oct Tampa Bay Water General Manager Jerry Maxwell agreed to allow two citizens of this donor community to attend Cone Ranch preapplication meetings as observers However despite the fact that ongoing studies continue to provide new project feasibility information no preapplication meeting notices have been provided to these two citizens In addition Tampa Bay Water has denied our requests to videotape the preapplication meetings so that the proceedings can be shared with a growing multicountyopposition base This unwillingness to share with the public information obtained at public expense is unfortunately consistent with many observations made by citizens and elected officials at the June meeting of the State Water Resources Committee How long will Tampa Bay Waters board of directors require us to endure this level of disrespect and manipulation CINDY RYANBROWN Plant City

inadequate compared with the benefit TECO received through its actions And its TECO customers not those responsible for the violations who will pay Legislation now before Congress would require electric utilities such as TECO to actually reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide percent by limit mercury by percent and reduce carbon dioxide emissions for the first time Floridas congressional delegation including representatives from the Tampa Bay region needs to get serious about air pollution Smog and fine particles are health threats that can no longer be ignored Valuable natural resources such as Tampa Bay are at risk from air pollution that is nearby and is washed into the bay Air pollution is both a local and national problem Secretary Struhs has demonstrated that we cant trust our state officials to protect our health from power plant pollution We need real reductions sooner rules or agreements with real teeth Maybe its time for a national solution GAIL KAMARAS Tallahassee The writer is director of the Energy Advocacy Program of the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation TECO is the dirtiest plant in the nation It has had years to achieve compliance but attempts to strike another good ol boy deal to get another years to pollute but the feds object and try to protect locals The water management district the term is not really descriptive of what it does voted to put the largest desalination plant near Big Bend plant Both members of the Hillsborough County Commission in the group voted against it but the majority representing water needs from Pasco and Pinellas County dont want it in their areas because it may not leave room for more development They voted to put it in our area with promises of no impact on the bay or canals A new wallboard plant is planned for a location near the Big Bend TECO plant and the desalination plant Company officials also promise no pollution will leave the site And oh by the way they will need lots of water Cargill announces that it needs to double the size of its gypsum stack in order to operate for the next years The company says there is no danger to the environment A consortium of phosphate companies has now announced that they want to put a liquidsulfur plant near Big Bend Again promises of no odor or pollutants leaving the site And again they will need more water My questions are Who if anyone is studying the cumulative effects of all these actions What plans are being made to ensure that there is no odor and that emissions do not leave the site What protection is being included in the permits to ensure an immediate clean up response and shutdown of the facility in case of an accident I do not believe there is anyone doing these things from a wholecommunity perspective The addition of the few jobs that will be created by this potentially disastrous collection of industries does not justify the potential damage to the bay our community and our childrens future Enough is enough RICHARD CLOY Apollo Beach Since Southwest Florida Water Management District has held monthly preapplication meetings on the Cone Ranch Dispersed Wells Project for Tampa Bay Water staff and consultants During these meetings new information related to this hotly debated wellfield are discussed and Tampa Bay Water gains a better understanding of what will be required to obtain a pumping permit for the Cone Ranch wellfield Citizens who organized in opposition to the Cone Ranch project were successful in obtaining the consultantprepared preapplication meeting notes approved by all attendees of the preapplication meetings Unfortunately the notes contain repetitive text missing and incorrect meeting dates apparent text deletions and poor definition of action items and responsibilities In response to complaints about the lack of detail and accuracy Tampa Bay Water responded that the reports were intended only to provide summaries of important discussion points and that the summaries were accurate In effect these accurate summaries prevented concerned citizens from sequentially reconstructing permitting developments at Cone Ranch and thereby limited public participation in the process On Oct Tampa Bay Water General Manager Jerry Maxwell agreed to allow two citizens of this donor community to attend Cone Ranch preapplication meetings as observers However despite the fact that ongoing studies continue to provide new project feasibility information no preapplication meeting notices have been provided to these two citizens In addition Tampa Bay Water has denied our requests to videotape the preapplication meetings so that the proceedings can be shared with a growing multicountyopposition base This unwillingness to share with the public information obtained at public expense is unfortunately consistent with many observations made by citizens and elected officials at the June meeting of the State Water Resources Committee How long will Tampa Bay Waters board of directors require us to endure this level of disrespect and manipulation CINDY RYANBROWN Plant City
