a little cocky given we should be undefeated going into Texas but he may still need to seek the shelter of the study as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead Sounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would only get in the way Im sure David will not let the fire die if she is truly interested in OU FYI OUs Spring Break is March next year So you can plan accordingly Let me know if you decide when you decide to come up and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour Also I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades I know that OU requires a on the ACT or finish in the top of your graduating class It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to or top of graduating class Looks like OU is following UT on tightening entrance requirements I can get you shirts caps sweatshirts etc for OU UT and Tech You can go to Bigtimesportscom and look at the styles I think they are also in the school colors If you see a style you like let me know the size shape and school and I can order it If some of it is for you let me know as they have different styles for women Also I can have logos etc reduced like I did on your Bevo on your shirt so they are not so big I always have them reduce the OU from to a size so I dont look like a poster boy for OU Anyway let me know and I will order them for you Let me know

the state of Oklahoma one daugther decorates one and the other decorates the second cake add some bean dip and chips and its our own version of a tailgate party We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall with our eye on that last game of the season However Klein High School has started the football season very strongly winning all games to date That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games Last year we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs So we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan We are interested in caps shirts etc for UT OU and Texas Tech Do you have a list of what is available for those schools Jacobs Ted K on PM To cc Subject RE Oklahoma Trip Thanks for the nice words I hope Enron will be able to look at some students for summer internships as I am sure they will be gone by Spring As far as
