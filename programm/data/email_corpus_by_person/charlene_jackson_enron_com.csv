<13043032.1075855776114.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,charlene.jackson@enron.com,2000-10-04 23:34:00,Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Cc Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene

<19741707.1075855850632.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,charlene.jackson@enron.com,2000-10-04 23:34:00,Re Hiring Practices for Summer Interns Cc Thanks for the email regarding summer interns I apologize that Lexi and Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking I wis h that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin g difficulty I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive That being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set it You are absolutely correct It is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge As you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm Brecker Merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects However in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research I have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years Most major organizations with the exception of the Accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring There are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the MBA programs For example Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until January As indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns Presentations were made in January February and offers were made in February and March The only school that did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope We did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns This past summer Enron had summer Analysts undergraduate and summer Associates graduate We intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments Approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join Enron The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions They generally focus on MBAs particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enrons competitors Because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only MBAs With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns In your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU You did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU While OU has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from UT o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson o According to Cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships Cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of Andersen Consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o In conclusion Cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t he statistics at this time I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such information It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told If you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies While I understand your concern with respect to OU they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit If you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are supportive however because Lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently As you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early August If you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts I hope this has been helpful I can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager Again I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance Charlene
