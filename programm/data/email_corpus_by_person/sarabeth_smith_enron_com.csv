contract operations services under an operating agreement TW has been asked in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these facilities Does TW have an interest in providing

North America One of their principal assets Louisiana Gas Service LGS is one of those companies recently sold by Citizens LGS provided gas control and operations services to other nonLGS companies including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in Arizona With the consummation of the sale of LGS Citizens has told me confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the interconnect metering and mile lateral pipeline facilities that interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power Plant Therefore Citizens is looking to possibly have a rd party provide contract operations services under an operating agreement TW has been asked in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these facilities Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for Citizens In a related legalregulatory question does TW have the authority to conduct contract services on behalf of others or would we have to perform these services as a separate legal entity If we do does this present an affiliate problem for us if we share operating employees If these threshold questions can be accommodated and TW is not only able to provide contract operations services for Citizens but has a commercial desire to do so what would we charge Citizens for this service Although it would appear at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities remember that Citizens will be receiving gas potentially from both TW and EPNG simultaneously presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure between the pipes but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts from both pipes as well as the plant site Although Im the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards transportation matters Im certainly willing to step out of the middle of this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves I will be happy to provide you a copy of the brief page letter Citizens sent to me on the

North America One of their principal assets Louisiana Gas Service LGS is one of those companies recently sold by Citizens LGS provided gas control and operations services to other nonLGS companies including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in Arizona With the consummation of the sale of LGS Citizens has told me confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the interconnect metering and mile lateral pipeline facilities that interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power Plant Therefore Citizens is looking to possibly have a rd party provide contract operations services under an operating agreement TW has been asked in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these facilities Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for Citizens In a related legalregulatory question does TW have the authority to conduct contract services on behalf of others or would we have to perform these services as a separate legal entity If we do does this present an affiliate problem for us if we share operating employees If these threshold questions can be accommodated and TW is not only able to provide contract operations services for Citizens but has a commercial desire to do so what would we charge Citizens for this service Although it would appear at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities remember that Citizens will be receiving gas potentially from both TW and EPNG simultaneously presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure between the pipes but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts from both pipes as well as the plant site Although Im the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards transportation matters Im certainly willing to step out of the middle of this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves I will be happy to provide you a copy of the brief page letter Citizens sent to me on the
