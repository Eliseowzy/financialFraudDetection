I cant think of a valid reaso n for performing this work I talked with Dave Nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place From a schedul ing perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just main tain your position and be able to change it If you were overpathed youd see it in the Path Manager either way Pinion Richard To restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply mar ket and a service adds any updownstream contract information andor Duns or DRN override and then saves it Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it reuses it and if it does not find an ex act match creates a new path and path id I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted Has this changed At o ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer e used I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected Therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify I dont think that this constant old path look up is needed Kinsey Lisa Get rid of this The scheduling position window does anyone use this If not well r emove the code logic that populates this window I have never seen a sched uler use this Please verify Pinion Richard Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system Autonoms so it was duplicate d in Unify by request It is not used in Unify now because of the other so phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate its use The only value wo uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o ther ways to determine those problems As voted on in a previous meeting o f the managers Lose it Kinsey Lisa Why is this still here On the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere nces List Again this code is called every retrieval time and doesnt app ear to be used from my observations If they do need this information we could provide it but if not Id prefer to remove the functionality Pin ion Richard This function is still very much in use by those with poin t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat hed through the same contract imbalance pool Keep it Kinsey Lisa Ye s We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths whats the aver age number of paths they create at one time What about updates I know t hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa ges of gas that they are limited in size to Does the system seem faster w hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts By update I mean going to the path list and changing an upstre am downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr eated Pinion Richard This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline There is no average They typically updat e a path with updownstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how ever I hope this answers your question I see no change to this process at this time Kinsey Lisa On some pipes this function is used more than others When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible At this time I do not see a need to change this process On brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se rvice In other words when updating Brokered arrangements we dont incor porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm ent link and hence sending it to be renominated Why do we do this for ser vice Is it because we have to renominate it I assume thats what its f or since we dont send brokered paths to the pipe Anyway with the Nomlog ic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service We need this verified Pinion Richard We do nt perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path I dont see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time Kinsey Lisa Agree with Richard

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

cant put the deals in the system just yet They should be available tomorrow hopefully They are for on the first and the on the second of January Path them accordingly depending on where that PAL gas

and finally from bridging back the first to Sitara Lets set a GOAL to have the first totally pathed and tracked and balanced and bridged back and clean by close of business the th YEAH BABY By the way

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lamadrid Victor Garcia Clarissa Jaquet Tammy Germany Chris Townsend Judy Cantrell Rebecca W Fulton Donna Molinaro Jeffrey Greif Donna Kelly Katherine L Breese Mark Halstead Lia Subject Hi All Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERCs order in the Transco Line Order proceeding and in the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Stephanie Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Victor Garcia Clarissa Jaquet Tammy Germany Chris Townsend Judy Cantrell Rebecca W Fulton Donna Molinaro Jeffrey Greif Donna Kelly Katherine L Breese Mark Halstead Lia Subject Hi All Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERCs order in the Transco Line Order proceeding and in the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

Lamadrid Victor Garcia Clarissa Jaquet Tammy Germany Chris Townsend Judy Cantrell Rebecca W Fulton Donna Molinaro Jeffrey Greif Donna Kelly Katherine L Breese Mark Halstead Lia Subject Hi All Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERCs order in the Transco Line Order proceeding and in the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lamadrid Victor Garcia Clarissa Jaquet Tammy Germany Chris Townsend Judy Cantrell Rebecca W Fulton Donna Molinaro Jeffrey Greif Donna Kelly Katherine L Breese Mark Halstead Lia Subject Hi All Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERCs order in the Transco Line Order proceeding and in the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said

Lucci Paul T Gay Randall L Sullivan Patti Hodge John Tholt Jane M Kuykendall Tori Mahmassani Souad South Steven P Shively Hunter S Grigsby Mike Neal Scott Gomez Julie A Sullivan Colleen Cc Steffes James D Lawner Leslie Neustaedter Robert Subject New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee ANR and Columbia had done These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates but FERC has decided that there is significant potential for undue discrimination and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative Thus anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly raterelated will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATEDRATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contractspecific cases FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is and is not allowed under negotiated rates In further defining its policy the commission continued to lean heavily on the linchpin of negotiatedrate authority that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under costbased recourse rates During discussion of the orders Chairman Pat Wood III said it was important to keep in mind as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side that all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines Last weeks proclamation should be considered a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend he asserted In representative language the commission said it wants to ensure that parties are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk of such unequal treatment FERC declared that a key factor in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an appropriate material deviation from a pipelines filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide adequate alternatives to other shippers In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co GT RP Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co RP et al and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp CP the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines generally available tariffs The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiatedrate package we have reconsidered that holding because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates it said in the Tennessee order Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity recourse service provides an adequate alternative the commission observed However if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute since recourse service would not include any such provision A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk giving it an advantage over recourserate shippers the commission pointed out A shippers right to reduce or terminate its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges FERC said adding that such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated in a fair manner FERC reasoned Once approved the tariff language will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift characterizing it as a muchneeded shot in the arm for a program that had become muddled Through a tortured line of cases FERCs definitions of allowable contracting practices were obscured Breathitt said in welcoming the new commonsense approach The tug of war that parties have engaged in over the past few years really hasnt served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service are available to all shippers she said
