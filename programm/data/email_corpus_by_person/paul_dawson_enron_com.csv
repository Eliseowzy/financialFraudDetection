general concern I had about the paper which was its treatment of imbalance settlement I would see this as one of the essential elements of market design Ive always felt that the physicalfinancial distinction was slightly artificial because even with physical contracts power systems must have a means for cash settlement of imbalances in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to contract volumes However the paper does not really pick this up and in section implies that cash settlement might only be feasible in some market structures I would have added imbalance settlement to section which describes the fundamentals required for any market It would also help to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement At the same time I would have dropped the mention of binding market rules from Id see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental principle Its also not made clear in what sense these commitments are binding Are they binding in a financial sense in which case they are covered by imbalance settlement or somehow physically either this is unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty which is ruled out later in the paper I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMPstransmission rights with other nonlocational elements of market design this makes it difficult to follow in places It would be clearer to have the locational elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed As Nick hints at below we wouldnt see this as an essential element of market design Under NETA individual participants commit their own units with the SO only taking over full control at hours out Even with centralised commitment Im not convinced that simple bidding would be superior to multipart bids Much here depends on timescales eg a dayahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc than a continuous hourly market with simple bids Simple bidding was often proposed for the Pool but I think a single daily big would have increased prices if twoshifting generators had not been able to reflect their startup and noload costs separately These elements were also gamed although this game eroded as competition increased Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper weve consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside positions Publicly weve argued that the proposals do not provide good economic signals over sufficiently long timeperiods to enhance allocative efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency gains constraints only cost about om pa here Despite arguing our commercial position Im quite happy with this approach and am genuinely sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK This position would of course change in much larger sparse and lessinterconnected networks such as exist in parts of the US Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must preserve preexisting implied rights for generators ie grandfathering I recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with imcumbent market power but I dont think that this is as big an issue in the UK where competition already exists as it is on the Contintent and in the US Hope these help let me know if you want to discuss further Paul Original Message From Elms Nick Sent May To Dawson Paul Subject Frontier Economics Whitepaper Paul Heres some comments on Frontiers whitepaper Do you want to discuss them Section The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is blurred Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification to Elexon Even then a party doesnt need to deliver on the contract it could cash out at the imbalance price However in practice NETA is more similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties try to avoid imbalances Section Decentralised commitment doesnt require parties to trade physical transmission contracts LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment It is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs Interim model section It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of jurisdictions in the US because of the private stakes in the industry The proposed dayahead market need not be run by the ISO Its not a unit commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment and even if it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading Rather dayahead trading could be left to the market to develop Generators would self commit based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading These dayahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs leaving parties with basis risk between the hub and their location Parties require some means of heging the basis risk financial transmission rights is a possibility Competitive framework section Demand side response reduces generators market power Forward contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and consumers particularly the impact of short term market power This may be an argument for using HHIs to measure market power A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supplydemand imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk And it may deter new entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs to customers Noneligible customers create a problem What price should these customers pay It is difficult to regulate a suppliers contracts and to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and noneligible customers This is why a spot price passthrough is suggested Financial institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers Those institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators An alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of noneligible customers To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the suppliers downside and upside risk Nick

October To Dawson Paul Cc Brown Michael COO London Shaw Eric Baumerich Gregor Kingsley Sophie Subject PERSONAL CONFIDENTIAL My Last Thoughts on GRA Sensitivity Confidential Paul sorry that you were in meetings when I was not yesterday morning Since I am on vacation or at least trying to be I didnt go back into the office looking for you later in the day The following are my last thoughts regarding Government and Reg Affairs people and organisational issues I will leave them with you and the others do with as you like John T Background Crossborder issues in power and EU vs the Germans and Dutch in Gas will likely be the big issues in the next to months on the continent We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the continent in the next months as through any commercial activity Much of this activity will have to be EU focused In power especially we have gotten almost not quite all but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national level work Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions Gas is and always has been much more of a Europewide theme than a national theme We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough positions without creating unneeded enemies We should look for local national allies where possible We cannot be the only voice in any country supporting a major position If there are no local forces supporting the position we need to findcreate some allies It cannot be Enron vs Germany or even worse Enron and EU vs Germany or Switzerland or wherever Loss of momentum at this time would be an error however focus would be an accomplishment Each issue will need a simultaneous AND coordinated EU and local effort Styles and the EU Office I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at this time and for the next to months Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter not all positive But he is the right man at the right time at the right place Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially responsible it is important to keep the Stylesforce working for Enron at the EU level Beyond his linguistic skills he understands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent Of course we should begin thinking about Peters EVENTUAL retirement We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become BUT right now he is essential German GRA Activities Permanent resource should become Jan Haizmann or however you spell it He is abrupt and offensive to AngloSaxons but then he is very German and the directness that some of us have come to appreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much I have gotten consistently positive feedback from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German officials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt If this is true I would encourage it There are no German official offices other than the Embassy in London We have I believe all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a selfpropelled project guy than a team player Thus I would agree that probably mid to longterm he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects But in the immediate future he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe Additionally with a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up with renewed interest in Austria and with the necessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland regarding transit it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too quickly As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann passing off relationships in an orderly manner ensuring that projects do not fall through the cracks etc there is still much for Paul to do It will be however necessary to give him a clear picture of his future or Enron will lose him entirely An open ended project boy job will not keep Paul indefinitely Lets not lose Paul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe Lars Atenhoefer Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work I continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than GRA frontend for Switzerland He would be glad to do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus Switzerland does notwill not justify fulltime GRA support but we must get more engaged there Less for our Swiss business than for our crossborder business and for continued grid and water power access The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held Everything going on in Switzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that Lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA person He belongs to Gregor and Eric I recommend talking with them about him Doug Wood I do not see a mid or longterm role for Doug Wood on the continent He only speaks English and currently has little feel for the continent which is neither American nor Britain English only players will ALWAYS fall behind locals In every country where we need to have an impact the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a local national GRA work is political ie irrational and emotional Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too doesnt wash with local politicians The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick The real business particularly regulatory and political business is always done in local language Local GRA people local country managers local lawyers etc are not going to suffer an English only player gladly Lets be realistic about this Doug Wood has no future on the continent Research Specialists and other such creatures We should not have such creatures That is a go nowhere job and it attracts go nowhere people More seriously it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst to get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk That will also help ensure that future commercial teams will better understand the role of GRA The continuity argument doesnt wash Many commercial Analyst and Associates rotate leaving continuity problems behind I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out in the future to rotating Analysts watch out Gregor and Eric Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions We must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task I have several times in several different countries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didnt have any resource Besides being expensive and wasteful this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience Perhaps each commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first round rotator All of our senior relationship work etc would be done much more professionally if that were the case and our consulting bills would fall Country Managers Each country manager such as Radmacher Renggli a hopefully soon to be new Italian one etc should be spending a meaningful ca to of their time on GRA activities The commercial country manager should by definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in hisher country They must be told that GRA leadership together with you and the gas and power leadership executives is part of their job A new market manager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their market off of the ground Any commercial country manager who wants to outsource GRA leadership in hisher country should be replaced Further this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people at this time Italy A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORTterm solution for Italy If we successfully hire a new Italian country manager he should get heavily involved in this initially Eventually we will need a reallive Italian in Italy but we probably dont need to look for himher this quarter Local Politics Local Language Local National Should apply to Germany The Netherlands AustriaSwitzerland perhaps together but then done by a German France perhaps Belgium Spain Italy I cannot imagine that we need any resource in former Communist Europe Poland Czech Republic Hungary Slovak Republic etc I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions but I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions I look forward to working with you in this regard Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes JT

general concern I had about the paper which was its treatment of imbalance settlement I would see this as one of the essential elements of market design Ive always felt that the physicalfinancial distinction was slightly artificial because even with physical contracts power systems must have a means for cash settlement of imbalances in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to contract volumes However the paper does not really pick this up and in section implies that cash settlement might only be feasible in some market structures I would have added imbalance settlement to section which describes the fundamentals required for any market It would also help to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement At the same time I would have dropped the mention of binding market rules from Id see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental principle Its also not made clear in what sense these commitments are binding Are they binding in a financial sense in which case they are covered by imbalance settlement or somehow physically either this is unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty which is ruled out later in the paper I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMPstransmission rights with other nonlocational elements of market design this makes it difficult to follow in places It would be clearer to have the locational elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed As Nick hints at below we wouldnt see this as an essential element of market design Under NETA individual participants commit their own units with the SO only taking over full control at hours out Even with centralised commitment Im not convinced that simple bidding would be superior to multipart bids Much here depends on timescales eg a dayahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc than a continuous hourly market with simple bids Simple bidding was often proposed for the Pool but I think a single daily big would have increased prices if twoshifting generators had not been able to reflect their startup and noload costs separately These elements were also gamed although this game eroded as competition increased Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper weve consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside positions Publicly weve argued that the proposals do not provide good economic signals over sufficiently long timeperiods to enhance allocative efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency gains constraints only cost about om pa here Despite arguing our commercial position Im quite happy with this approach and am genuinely sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK This position would of course change in much larger sparse and lessinterconnected networks such as exist in parts of the US Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must preserve preexisting implied rights for generators ie grandfathering I recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with imcumbent market power but I dont think that this is as big an issue in the UK where competition already exists as it is on the Contintent and in the US Hope these help let me know if you want to discuss further Paul Original Message From Elms Nick Sent May To Dawson Paul Subject Frontier Economics Whitepaper Paul Heres some comments on Frontiers whitepaper Do you want to discuss them Section The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is blurred Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification to Elexon Even then a party doesnt need to deliver on the contract it could cash out at the imbalance price However in practice NETA is more similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties try to avoid imbalances Section Decentralised commitment doesnt require parties to trade physical transmission contracts LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment It is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs Interim model section It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of jurisdictions in the US because of the private stakes in the industry The proposed dayahead market need not be run by the ISO Its not a unit commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment and even if it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading Rather dayahead trading could be left to the market to develop Generators would self commit based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading These dayahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs leaving parties with basis risk between the hub and their location Parties require some means of heging the basis risk financial transmission rights is a possibility Competitive framework section Demand side response reduces generators market power Forward contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and consumers particularly the impact of short term market power This may be an argument for using HHIs to measure market power A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supplydemand imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk And it may deter new entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs to customers Noneligible customers create a problem What price should these customers pay It is difficult to regulate a suppliers contracts and to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and noneligible customers This is why a spot price passthrough is suggested Financial institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers Those institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators An alternative is

general concern I had about the paper which was its treatment of imbalance settlement I would see this as one of the essential elements of market design Ive always felt that the physicalfinancial distinction was slightly artificial because even with physical contracts power systems must have a means for cash settlement of imbalances in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to contract volumes However the paper does not really pick this up and in section implies that cash settlement might only be feasible in some market structures I would have added imbalance settlement to section which describes the fundamentals required for any market It would also help to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement At the same time I would have dropped the mention of binding market rules from Id see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental principle Its also not made clear in what sense these commitments are binding Are they binding in a financial sense in which case they are covered by imbalance settlement or somehow physically either this is unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty which is ruled out later in the paper I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMPstransmission rights with other nonlocational elements of market design this makes it difficult to follow in places It would be clearer to have the locational elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed As Nick hints at below we wouldnt see this as an essential element of market design Under NETA individual participants commit their own units with the SO only taking over full control at hours out Even with centralised commitment Im not convinced that simple bidding would be superior to multipart bids Much here depends on timescales eg a dayahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc than a continuous hourly market with simple bids Simple bidding was often proposed for the Pool but I think a single daily big would have increased prices if twoshifting generators had not been able to reflect their startup and noload costs separately These elements were also gamed although this game eroded as competition increased Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper weve consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside positions Publicly weve argued that the proposals do not provide good economic signals over sufficiently long timeperiods to enhance allocative efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency gains constraints only cost about om pa here Despite arguing our commercial position Im quite happy with this approach and am genuinely sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK This position would of course change in much larger sparse and lessinterconnected networks such as exist in parts of the US Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must preserve preexisting implied rights for generators ie grandfathering I recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with imcumbent market power but I dont think that this is as big an issue in the UK where competition already exists as it is on the Contintent and in the US Hope these help let me know if you want to discuss further Paul Original Message From Elms Nick Sent May To Dawson Paul Subject Frontier Economics Whitepaper Paul Heres some comments on Frontiers whitepaper Do you want to discuss them Section The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is blurred Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification to Elexon Even then a party doesnt need to deliver on the contract it could cash out at the imbalance price However in practice NETA is more similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties try to avoid imbalances Section Decentralised commitment doesnt require parties to trade physical transmission contracts LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment It is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs Interim model section It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of jurisdictions in the US because of the private stakes in the industry The proposed dayahead market need not be run by the ISO Its not a unit commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment and even if it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading Rather dayahead trading could be left to the market to develop Generators would self commit based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading These dayahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs leaving parties with basis risk between the hub and their location Parties require some means of heging the basis risk financial transmission rights is a possibility Competitive framework section Demand side response reduces generators market power Forward contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and consumers particularly the impact of short term market power This may be an argument for using HHIs to measure market power A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supplydemand imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk And it may deter new entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs to customers Noneligible customers create a problem What price should these customers pay It is difficult to regulate a suppliers contracts and to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and noneligible customers This is why a spot price passthrough is suggested Financial institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers Those institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators An alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of noneligible customers To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the suppliers downside and upside risk Nick

take tough positions without creating unneeded enemies We should look for local national allies where possible We cannot be the only voice in any country supporting a major position If there are no local forces supporting the position we need to findcreate some allies It cannot be Enron vs Germany or even worse Enron and EU vs Germany or Switzerland or wherever Loss of momentum at this time would be an error however focus would be an accomplishment Each issue will need a simultaneous AND coordinated EU and local effort Styles and the EU Office I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at this time and for the next to months Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter not all positive But he is the right man at the right time at the right place Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially responsible it is important to keep the Stylesforce working for Enron at the EU level Beyond his linguistic skills he understands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent Of course we should begin thinking about Peters EVENTUAL retirement We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become BUT right now he is essential German GRA Activities Permanent resource should become Jan Haizmann or however you spell it He is abrupt and offensive to AngloSaxons but then he is very German and the directness that some of us have come to appreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much I have gotten consistently positive feedback from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German officials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt If this is true I would encourage it There are no German official offices other than the Embassy in London We have I believe all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a selfpropelled project guy than a team player Thus I would agree that probably mid to longterm he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects But in the immediate future he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe Additionally with a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up with renewed interest in Austria and with the necessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland regarding transit it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too quickly As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann passing off relationships in an orderly manner ensuring that projects do not fall through the cracks etc there is still much for Paul to do It will be however necessary to give him a clear picture of his future or Enron will lose him entirely An open ended project boy job will not keep Paul indefinitely Lets not lose Paul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe Lars Atenhoefer Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work I continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than GRA frontend for Switzerland He would be glad to do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus Switzerland does notwill not justify fulltime GRA support but we must get more engaged there Less for our Swiss business than for our crossborder business and for continued grid and water power access The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held Everything going on in Switzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that Lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA person He belongs to Gregor and Eric I recommend talking with them about him Doug Wood I do not see a mid or longterm role for Doug Wood on the continent He only speaks English and currently has little feel for the continent which is neither American nor Britain English only players will ALWAYS fall behind locals In every country where we need to have an impact the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a local national GRA work is political ie irrational and emotional Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too doesnt wash with local politicians The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick The real business particularly regulatory and political business is always done in local language Local GRA people local country managers local lawyers etc are not going to suffer an English only player gladly Lets be realistic about this Doug Wood has no future on the continent Research Specialists and other such creatures We should not have such creatures That is a go nowhere job and it attracts go nowhere people More seriously it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst to get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk That will also help ensure that future commercial teams will better understand the role of GRA The continuity argument doesnt wash Many commercial Analyst and Associates rotate leaving continuity problems behind I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out in the future to rotating Analysts watch out Gregor and Eric Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions We must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task I have several times in several different countries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didnt have any resource Besides being expensive and wasteful this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience Perhaps each commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first round rotator All of our senior relationship work etc would be done much more professionally if that were the case and our consulting bills would fall Country Managers Each country manager such as Radmacher Renggli a hopefully soon to be new Italian one etc should be spending a meaningful ca to of their time on GRA activities The commercial country manager should by definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in hisher country They must be told that GRA leadership together with you and the gas and power leadership executives is part of their job A new market manager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their market off of the ground Any commercial country manager who wants to outsource GRA leadership in hisher country should be replaced Further this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people at this time Italy A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORTterm solution for Italy If we successfully hire a new Italian country manager he should get heavily involved in this initially Eventually we will need a reallive Italian in Italy but we probably dont need to look for himher this quarter Local Politics Local Language Local National Should apply to Germany The Netherlands AustriaSwitzerland perhaps together but then done by a German France perhaps Belgium Spain Italy I cannot imagine that we need any resource in former Communist Europe Poland Czech Republic Hungary Slovak Republic etc I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions but I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions I look forward to working with you in this regard Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes JT

questions looks good and Id be happy to discuss further if required Cheers Paul Original Message From Dawson Paul Sent November To Maurer Luiz Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Stroup Kerry Subject RE Draft Questions to Ashley Brown The state of transmissiontransportation regulation here is continually evolving and a full treatment would qualify for an economics doctorate You should also be aware that not everything out of Ofgem the UK regulator makes sense Hence while Ive provided some answers to your specific questions below I would see these only as broad guides to the issues you are facing in the US and would retain a healthy degree of scepticism about the lessons to be drawn from UK schemes In particular I would caution against relying solely on the NGC incentives document since this is only a small part of a much large jigsaw of price controls etc Do you think that the UK forprofit Transco model has been working satisfactorily We know it is still early for you to make a final judgement but have the incentives and penalties shaped the way NG behaves in terms of costs and elimination of T contraints The forprofit model has worked reasonably well so far Both RPIX regulation and NGCTranscos incentive schemes have driven out many operating costs However the link into ensuring longterm investment is not clear RPIX in its purest form has poor investment incentives Ofgem are seeking to remedy this by introducing longerterm contracts for transmission capacity together with upside rates of return if the companies improve on some key output measures they are leading the way on this in gas Nevertheless I think theyre still some way short of solving the problem In my view this is because the problem borders on the insoluble Ofgem are obsessed with introducing market based signals for new investment Im deeply sceptical about this while you can auction fixed amounts of capacity and thereby get a market price the capacity made available at one location depends on the amount made available at all other locations In short there are major network externalities which are the source of the natural monopoly in transmission As a result the regulator andor the Transco will always need to define how much capacity should be built and made available at particular locations In turn this means that while contracts can play some role we cant leave regulation behind in ensuring that sufficient network capacity is made availalble As far as the forprofit and nonprofit debate goes Im an agnostic The former can undoubtedly focus the mind NGC have virtually removed voltage constraint from the system due to installation of reactive compensation equipment but serious doubts still remain about the ability of the UK system to implement major new investment On the flip side I would be concerned about how to ensure appropriate performance incentives for nonproift transmission organisation We took a good look a the NGC system operator price control and incentive schemes under NETA Final Proposal Dated December attached Which of the alternative proposals on page has been adopted The final proposals are here docsngcmodmarchpdf These might be useful if youre having trouble sleeping but I suspect that the finer details of NGCs scheme are too casespecific to be of any use elsewhere The key element I think is the fact that Ofgem gave NGC a choice from several different incentive schemes This mirrors some economic theory developed by Laffont and Tirole on the design of optimal incentive sctructures The idea is to overcome the information assymmetry between the regulator and company because the company reveals the optimal structure in choosing between the alternatives Have the incentivespenalties system been working or have them been subject to reviews in terms of targes upsides collars and other parameters due to external factors beyond Transco control The incentive schemes are subject to regular review but for the reasons above Im not sure you can draw any lessons beyond the general lesson that incentive schemes can be useful ways of making efficiency gains Im not aware of any scheme being reopened because of external factors Could you send us or help us find the official Transmission Licence Agreement where all incentives and penalties are clearly spelled out As above but again how relevant are these specifics for your purposes Question related to NETA rules As I understood there is not a central pool and market participants generators and suppliers have to submit a balanced schedule in the forward market NG is responsible for small imbalances or residual purchasing If that is true how can NG be made accountable for energy deviations in the real time that it has no control whatsoever It seems that the incentive mechamism takes this metrics into account NGC accepts offers for more generation or less demand and bids for less generation and more demand which it calls off to balance the system in real time It doesnt need control because people are free to price these offers and bids as they see fit NGC can also enter balancing services contracts for particular ancillary services reserve reactive support etc NGC is subject to a balancing services incentive scheme which ensures that they balance the system economically Do you think the profitRTO as proposed by NETA could live with a completely different congestion management system such as central dispatchLMPfinancial rights as current in used in the PJM pools in the USWe have the impression that NG advocates a profit RTO and a selfdispatch physical rights congestion system We have been advocating the former Im yet to be convinced that there are huge differences between physicalfinancial transmission schemes despite noodling on the problem continuously for the last years it all started in CA in At the end of the day someone the system operator must decide what is required where to keep the system stable ie to make spot decisions on transmission availability If the capacity is fungible you would also expect a secondary market to emerge in physical rights It would however be practically quite difficult to introduce an LMP scheme under NETA This is why were moving down the entryexit physical capacity route We prepared a list of questions to be sent to NG Could you please take a look Do they make sense Are they based on correct assumptions regarding the UK system Any other aspects to be investigated Question is the main problem to resolve both within an RTOs region and between RTOs You might want to expand this

different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula Generation interconnection Obviously your proposal did not go that far Conceptually do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs use of the system are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component and connection costs are treates separately according to a shallow method Establishment of transmission rates How
