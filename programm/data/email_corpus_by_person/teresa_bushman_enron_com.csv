regarding the Cypress JOA cash call issue that you had inquired about As I mentioned in my voicemail to you I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed Steve was out of the office much of last week he followed up Friday with the attached email message As Steve mentions in his email there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steves execution From Steves reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout which had been initialled by Allen I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen Steve is one of the best and the brightest Ive worked with at Enron He is extremely busy working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E P assets as well as working on new deals I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated I will remind the ECR group at Mondays staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed Where do we go from here Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM Steve NRON PM To cc Subject Kelly Farmout Agreement Cypress Venture Teresa Thank you for approaching me directly about the issue of my failure to obtain legal review of the subject farmout agreement in Enron Energy Capital Resources ECR Cypress Venture The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible Rozel Energy led by Bill Rogers identified a high potential relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil Gas sub of Contour Energy He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled of the acreage but it was set to expire on Sept Rozel after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already topleased a significant portion of the prospect Had the Kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect Rozel with the help of Allen Wilhite approached Kelley for a farmout Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option Kelley elected to participate for of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement Kelley sought to operate the well which ECR rejected due to Kelleys poor track record in drilling deep S Louisiana wells Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S Louisiana Stokes and Speiler who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine who each have over years experience in mangement of drilling operations Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was nonresponsive to Allens efforts to finalize the agreement Allen Craig Fox Arvel Martin and I met with Kelleys Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport we thought The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept th by Kelley and Allen Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations With Kelleys consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept th lease expiration Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October effective Sept Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelleys offices to deliver the document I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directlyowned asset that I had encountered I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GPs in our Juniper Bonne Terre historically and Texland ventures and a farmout with Enrons name on the line It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOAs in directly owned assets as opposed to LPs with a GP such as Juniper require Legal review and signoff The compliance meeting last week underscored that point We had outside counsel Lisa Jaubert under your direction review the TriC and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue The demands that our large oil gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss The Bonne Terre Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA to be held in BT Exploration LLC will increase the legal and commercial activity level We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S Riceville prospect late next week I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire I regret my failure to obtain your review and

me to discuss as soon as possible This transaction is to close this week and these contracts are conditions to closing Thanks for your assistance Teresa Teresa G Bushman Enron North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM AM To cc Subject Brazos VPP Open issues Tax Issues I have spoken with my tax partner T Hardie about a couple of issues First is whether we should increase the general partners share from to in order to reduce a possible risk that Brazos VPP Limited Partnership might somehow not be treated as a partnership for tax purposes T does not feel strongly about this in part because the consequences should not be adverse and unless Kevin desires otherwise I think we should leave the percentage at Any tax law with respect to the minimum level is probably obsolete now that we have checkthebox elections for tax treatment as a partnership Nora advises me that Stan is fine with this from an accounting perspective The second tax issue is whether Agave as depositor under the Trust Agreement can be tax matters partner for the Trust which will also elect to be taxed as a partnership Since only a partner can be tax matters partner it appears that one of the Class B Certificateholders ie Bank of America must be the tax matters partner The Servicer can of course assist with preparation of income tax filings Balancing Agreement Attached below is a revised Balancing Agreement with the changes discussed on Monday night by Nora Tim Teresa Bob and me The principal change is to add an indemnity section to this Agreement in place of the indemnity we want to delete from the Participation Agreement that Bracewell Patterson has prepared This indemnity is based on the Term Sheet and is considerably narrower but since we did not discuss it specifically please review it carefully Please pay attention to the note following the definition of Servicer Fee that suggests that the LIBOR breakage costs and capital adequacy costs be moved to the new indemnity section Nora and I think that this would be more appealing to the Banks but Stan may prefer to have this built into the Servicing Fee See attached file Balancing Agreement Ver from doc Physical Sales Contracts One of our biggest challenges to a quick closing is getting everyone to agree on some important features of the master gas and oil purchasesale agreements The term sheet given to the Banks says the following A With respect to each Production Payment under which Brazos expects to receive deliveries of natural gas in kind Brazos shall enter into a confirmation under the NGPSA with ENA whereby ENA or ERAC shall purchase all gas or oil delivered to the Company in kind under such Production Payment and pay floating prices for such gas or oil The floating prices will be swapped into predetermined fixed prices via an Energy Price Swap Agreement B Brazos will dedicate to ENA or ERAC all Production Payment gas or oil which is delivered under the Production Payments documents C The quantities of gas or oil purchased each month shall consist of all gas or oilactually delivered in kind to Brazos during such month under the Production Payment ENA and ERAC will be notified monthly in advance of the amount of gas or oil expected to be delivered at each delivery point D If the actual quantity of Production Payment hydrocarbons delivered to Brazos is less than the scheduled quantity of hydrocarbons to be delivered the Scheduled Volumes and the producer has not delivered adjustment quantities of Production Payment hydrocarbons to satisfy such deficiency the Servicer ie Agave the new Enron subsidiary guaranteed by Enron Corp will make a mandatory advance equal to the value of such deficiency at the applicable ENA or ERAC price E As consideration for the mandatory advance Brazos will assign to the Servicer the right to receive the Adjustment Quantities or cash that Brazos is entitled to receive under the Production Payment documents related to such delivery under the Production Payment In analyzing the physical contracts and all other components of this deal it is important to remember that one purpose of the deal is to lock in for at least the debt component of the total financing a cash flow stream that amortizes the debt over the entire term of each Production Payment The pieces of the deal the oil and gas accruing to the Production Payment the physical sales contracts and the swaps have to fit together for the entire life of each Production Payment It is also important to remember that if there is a mismatch in cash flows it will most likely be made up by payments from Enron Corp under its guaranty of Agaves mandatory balancing advances So it behooves Enron as well as the Banks to make sure that the pieces of the deal fit together It therefore seems to me that the physical contracts need to have the following features the physical contracts need to cover all of the production accruing to each Production Payment during the life of that Production Payment including both scheduled quantities and adjustment quantities Therefore there can be no minimum or maximum limits on quantities taken and the right to terminate the physical contracts must be limited to a real meltdown situation It is probably misleading to talk about the scheduled amounts being on a firm basis the physical contracts need to match the commodity price swaps that ENA will be providing for the scheduled amounts of production with floating prices for these scheduled amounts that are identical to the floating swap prices Therefore the Contract Prices for the scheduled amounts of gas need to key off of Inside FERC and the Contract Prices for the scheduled amounts of oil need to key off of NYMEX WTI in each case with any agreed basis differentials the physical contracts need to price the adjustment quantities in a way that causes the adjustment quantities to generate enough cash to repay AgaveEnron for any mandatory balancing advances The way to do this is to price any deliveries in excess of the scheduled amounts at the Index Prices contained in the production payment conveyances The Index Prices for gas in the two existing deals are Gas Daily prices and for oil are NYMEX WTI less differentials the physical contracts need to match the timing of the conveyances for adjustment quantities This is daily for gas deliveries and monthly for oil deliveries the physical contracts need to have a cover formula that protects both ENAERAC and AgaveEnron The present formula in the Enfolio contract says that ENA pays the Contract Price for the scheduled quantities that are delivered and that Brazos pays the product of the shortfall in scheduled quantities times the positive remainder if any of the Index Price minus the Contract Price We need to change this last feature to say that Brazos pays this remainder if positive but that Brazos also gets a credit is this remainder is negative Tim Proffitt can explain the math to anyone that wants to understand it but the basic idea is that if there is a shortfall Brazos buys gas from ENA at the Index Price to cover the shortfall and then ENA pays the Contract Price for the full scheduled amount the contracts need to do away with any concept of frequent trading over the phone Each Production Payment should generate only one written confirmation the contracts need to be clear that netting occurs over all transactions This should protect ENA and ERAC against Brazos owing them money for one Production Payment where production has substantially shut down and not having the ability to pay In light of the above we also need to consider whether we are better off starting with the modern Enfolio form

North America Corp Smith Street EB A Houston TX fax Forwarded by Teresa G BushmanHOUECT on PM AM To cc Subject Brazos VPP Open issues Tax Issues I have spoken with my tax partner T Hardie about a couple of issues First is whether we should increase the general partners share from to in order to reduce a possible risk that Brazos VPP Limited Partnership might somehow not be treated as a partnership for tax purposes T does not feel strongly about this in part because the consequences should not be adverse and unless Kevin desires otherwise I think we should leave the percentage at Any tax law with respect to the minimum level is probably obsolete now that we have checkthebox elections for tax treatment as a partnership Nora advises me that Stan is fine with this from an accounting perspective The second tax issue is whether Agave as depositor under the Trust Agreement can be tax matters partner for the Trust which will also elect to be taxed as a partnership Since only a partner can be tax matters partner it appears that one of the Class B Certificateholders ie Bank of America must be the tax matters partner The Servicer can of course assist with preparation of income tax filings Balancing Agreement Attached below is a revised Balancing Agreement with the changes discussed on Monday night by Nora Tim Teresa Bob and me The principal change is to add an indemnity section to this Agreement in place of the indemnity we want to delete from the Participation Agreement that Bracewell Patterson has prepared This indemnity is based on the Term Sheet and is considerably narrower but since we did not discuss it specifically please review it carefully Please pay attention to the note following the definition of Servicer Fee that suggests that the LIBOR breakage costs and capital adequacy costs be moved to the new indemnity section Nora and I think that this would be more appealing to the Banks but Stan may prefer to have this built into the Servicing Fee See attached file Balancing Agreement Ver from doc Physical Sales Contracts One of our biggest challenges to a quick closing is getting everyone to agree on some important features of the master gas and oil purchasesale agreements The term sheet given to the Banks says the following A With respect to each Production Payment under which Brazos expects to receive deliveries of natural gas in kind Brazos shall enter into a confirmation under the NGPSA with ENA whereby ENA or ERAC shall purchase all gas or oil delivered to the Company in kind under such Production Payment and pay floating prices for such gas or oil The floating prices will be swapped into predetermined fixed prices via an Energy Price Swap Agreement B Brazos will dedicate to ENA or ERAC all Production Payment gas or oil which is delivered under the Production Payments documents C The quantities of gas or oil purchased each month shall consist of all gas or oilactually delivered in kind to Brazos during such month under the Production Payment ENA and ERAC will be notified monthly in advance of the amount of gas or oil expected to be delivered at each delivery point D If the actual quantity of Production Payment hydrocarbons delivered to Brazos is less than the scheduled quantity of hydrocarbons to be delivered the Scheduled Volumes and the producer has not delivered adjustment quantities of Production Payment hydrocarbons to satisfy such deficiency the Servicer ie Agave the new Enron subsidiary guaranteed by Enron Corp will make a mandatory advance equal to the value of such deficiency at the applicable ENA or ERAC price E As consideration for the mandatory advance Brazos will assign to the Servicer the right to receive the Adjustment Quantities or cash that Brazos is entitled to receive under the Production Payment documents related to such delivery under the Production Payment In analyzing the physical contracts and all other components of this deal it is important to remember that one purpose of the deal is to lock in for at least the debt component of the total financing a cash flow stream that amortizes the debt over the entire term of each Production Payment The pieces of the deal the oil and gas accruing to the Production Payment the physical sales contracts and the swaps have to fit together for the entire life of each Production Payment It is also important to remember that if there is a mismatch in cash flows it will most likely be made up by payments from Enron Corp under its guaranty of Agaves mandatory balancing advances So it behooves Enron as well as the Banks to make sure that the pieces of the deal fit together It therefore seems to me that the physical contracts need to have the following features the physical contracts need to cover all of the production accruing to each Production Payment during the life of that Production Payment including both scheduled quantities and adjustment quantities Therefore there can be no minimum or maximum limits on quantities taken and the right to terminate the physical contracts must be limited to a real meltdown situation It is probably misleading to talk about the scheduled amounts being on a firm basis the physical contracts need to match the commodity price swaps that ENA will be providing for the scheduled amounts of production with floating prices for these scheduled amounts that are identical to the floating swap prices Therefore the Contract Prices for the scheduled amounts of gas need to key off of Inside FERC and the Contract Prices for the scheduled amounts of oil need to key off of NYMEX WTI in each case with any agreed basis differentials the physical contracts need to price the adjustment quantities in a way that causes the adjustment quantities to generate enough cash to repay AgaveEnron for any mandatory balancing advances The way to do this is to price any deliveries in excess of the scheduled amounts at the Index Prices contained in the production payment conveyances The Index Prices for gas in the two existing deals are Gas Daily prices and for oil are NYMEX WTI less differentials the physical contracts need to match the timing of the conveyances for adjustment quantities This is daily for gas deliveries and monthly for oil deliveries the physical contracts need to have a cover formula that protects both ENAERAC and AgaveEnron The present formula in the Enfolio contract says that ENA pays the Contract Price for the scheduled quantities that are delivered and that Brazos pays the product of the shortfall in scheduled quantities times the positive remainder if any of the Index Price minus the Contract Price We need to change this last feature to say that Brazos pays this remainder if positive but that Brazos also gets a credit is this remainder is negative Tim Proffitt can explain the math to anyone that wants to understand it but the basic idea is that if there is a shortfall Brazos buys gas from ENA at the Index Price to cover the shortfall and then ENA pays the Contract Price for the full scheduled amount the contracts need to do away with any concept of frequent trading over the phone Each Production Payment should generate only one written confirmation the contracts need to be clear that netting occurs over all transactions This should protect ENA and ERAC against Brazos owing them money for one Production Payment where production has substantially shut down and not having the ability to pay In light of the above we also need to consider whether we are better off starting with the modern Enfolio form that is designed for true commercial transactions or whether it makes more sense to add the points described above to the old Cactus form John W Rain Thompson
