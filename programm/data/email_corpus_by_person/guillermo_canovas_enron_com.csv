<25708158.1075851975384.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,guillermo.canovas@enron.com,2001-07-15 15:15:00,Re Please read Argentina economic riskassume the issue is TGS instead of CGS I will call you after sending this mail Below is a small analysis related to the convertibility Law and TGS Argentina Convertibility Law No The Convertibility Law passed on March determined the following Established a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and the national currency dollar D Australes latter defined as equal to peso The Central Bank Argentine Federal Reserve must permanently have international reserves dollars gold other currencies available to back of the monetary base The Central Bank must sell all required dollars at the fixed exchange rate It is forbidden any price adjustment clause by an index For all transactions agreed upon before the Law prices could not be larg er than the contractual price adjusted by the exchange rate variation plus a year section This section affected contracts in force The Convertibility Law was just amended on June nd by the Law to equal peso to the simple average of dollar and euro Anyway according to its section the new Convertibility rule will only be in for ce once the price market of dollar is equal to euro to avoid a surprise devaluation Legal requirements for a devaluation To modify the exchange rate before dollar D euro it would be necessa ry to abolish or amend again the Convertibility Law In such regards the Congress would have to abolish the Convertibility Law or keep the Convertibility at a different exchange rate Although in principle a devaluation should not affect contracts with prices set in dollars even the Convertibility Law has affected contracts that wer e in force So there is a certain risk that a new eventual amendment of the Convertibility Law could affect contracts in force In fact I think there is a higher risk of the government breaching the contracts or defaulting debt payments than devaluating the currency by surprise Impact on TGS Since the privatization rules establish that TGS rates are in dollars a devaluation that respects contracts in force should not have a significant impact on TGS financial results However due to the social impact of a devaluation the Congress could pass a new law establishing a new mechanism to calculate Public Utilities rates T he higher the percentage of devaluation and the higher the social turmoil t he higher is the probability that this kind of Law would be passed Richard Shapiro PM To Guillermo nron cc Subject Please read Argentina economic risk Lets discuss Forwarded by Richard ShapiroNAEnron on PM From Robert nronXgate on AM To Richard nron cc Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Brendan nronXgate Scott nronXgate Subject Please read Argentina economic risk Hi Rick Kevin Hannon asked that we contact you to coordinate some market intelligence research pertaining to the deepening financial crisis in Argentina Kevin would like us to investigate how Enrons CGS project will be treated by the Argentinean govt should a default or devaluation take place We understand that you have the contract providing more information on how the project is protected by international treaty It would be great if we could get a copy and meet with you briefly to discuss this request Thanks for any help you can provide during what I know is a very busy time for you Robert Johnston Manager Market Analysis Enron Wholesale Services x

If the economic and political environment gets calmer these rules will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year Goal Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps there will not be more fuel declarations but price declarations Section Resolution The rules do not mention any cap for price declarations Goal Daily fuel declaration The month fuel declaration was replaced by a daily price declaration Section Resolution Goal Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements with end users or LDCs According to the interpretation of AGEERA Gencos Association we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not have supply guarantee Section Resolution It is not clear in the rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the technical Procedures in line with these rules From the text of Resolution sections c and considerations there would be a good probability to reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule Reduce minimum term for Output Demand Marketing Agreements to one month Eliminate or reduce to MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements Amr and I are

nron John J nron cc Subject Power Decree and Resolution In an attempt to further reduce State intervention in the power market on June the Executive Branch issued Decree which completes the deregulation process of the power industry initiated in and amends Electricity Law On June the Minister of Infrastructure issued Resolution setting forth the guidelines for the future regulation of the Decree The Secretariat of Energys resolution that will regulate the Decree will be effective as from September All agents of the electric sector will be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree although such comments will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document Although Decree No is effective as from today there are doubts in the industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress The reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the framework of the Competitivity Law by which Congress delegated to the Executive Branch its powers to legislate specifically on changes required to transform the economy Although this Decree and the changes it fosters indirectly affect the economy since the law it amends is not purely economical it may be questioned There is no term within which Congress may exercise this right Please find a summary of the relevant changes below Generators Remuneration Forward Market freely negotiated Spot Market only payment of hourly spot price at each node Hourly Spot Price determined by price offers based on demand and transportation constraints Daily Declarations The day before the daily dispatch each Generator shall declare its price offers for each peak shoulder and valley hour at its node declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity offer all of its available capacity Calculation of Hourly Spot Price HSP HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by the Secretariat of Energy not based on marginal costs as it is today Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations on the system Spot Market Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the volume of energy delivered at the node which shall be valued at the HSP If distributors large users andor marketers enter into supply contracts then to clear transactions on the spot market the OED shall consider that the sellers MarketersGenerators assume their clients payment obligations before the market On spot market transactions Generators shall not receive payments for any other concept Forward Market Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms Marketers Are now considered agents of the electric sector May enter into forward contracts andor carry our purchase and sale transactions on the spot market at the node HSP Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors when they transact at the MEM Congestion Rights Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of

contracting options with or without supply guaranty these contracts shall be considered special contracts When they contract their demand with Generators andor Marketers the general terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their end users tariffs the relation between the term of the contracts and the volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the greater the term of the contract the lesser the percentage of contracted energy In any case the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of the total demand of users that cant transact on the MEM Forced Dispatch Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of the same Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are reasonable
