<3544.1075862886575.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.harada@enron.com,2001-11-08 08:47:06,thank youKen I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent events It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past three and a half years The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a personal inspiration to me Seeing your leadership firsthand has been a real treat Receiving the Chairmans Award last year was an incredible honor It is difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers of amazingly dedicated yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron I have the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image I wouldnt ever wish that on you especially in light of the recent challenges you are experiencing So I apologize if that does come to pass One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses Ive observed with EES origination management There is a general feeling of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept of an open door is political suicide HR is as much at fault in my opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective view and judgement of the abuses My words and credibility may not carry any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination that is all too common at EES Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees and lost potential benefit to Enron I leave with no bad feelings toward the company and am proud to have been a part of Enron The shift in EES business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this past spring Being based outside of Houston in the Chicago area my career opportunities are limited And as much as I tried I was feeling stale and unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to move on Ken I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult time I wish that I could have done more If I can ever help I hope that you wont hesitate to ask Thank you again Respectfully mark home Poplar Avenue Elmhurst IL
