LondonHere is an update on BMC Based on the following I would say this BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works and in one situation appears to have done so successfully Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of were desired or acceptable and instead offered another pushback WinK certifctn therefore BMC doesnt appear to have been given further opportunity to identify what issues if any are still open at Net Works I dont see evidence either in these notes OR having come out from any of the many telephone conversations Ive been in that Net Works has provided any responses since or soPeter Goebel and I met wNet Works EBS on and I have had no calls or emails responding to my requests for information relative to what are your top problems in this BMC situation Net Works from Net Works So I feel confident that there are more issues left off the table by Net Works than will be discussed because Net Works doesnt want any of BMCs solutions Period The Result EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC as far as Net Works folks are concerned In the I dont want any surprises mode I thought Id give George a headsup re possible fallout around the BMC thing I told George in this mornings staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team I dont see a problem here and what you and I suggested EBS do buy and implement M of BMCs stuff pay M for credit which any ENE business unit could access etc I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were likely to encourage Crowder to lean on Philippe which I had recommended against

certification as well as reporting on the testing Its in the document but to point it out ControlSA is ready for certification process on Dec of and ControlM on March Ann M Munson Senior Sales Representative BMC Software Direct Fax Original Message From Hallberg Rob Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc Munson Ann Subject WinK Certification Hi Bruce I have attached a document detailing the status of Microsoft Certification We have also summarized our Windows development and certification methodology which is actually a twophase approach The most critical phase which ensures WinK compatibility and support and includes customer testing has been completed The WinK Agents are GA for both ControlM scheduling and ControlSA security The next phase which is also a key element of our development strategy is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for Microsoft WinK This phase follows the WinK initial release as MS Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the applications functionality ability to work correctly in the ControlM environment Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of the application It is my understanding that one of the reasons ControlM is being considered as a replacement for sysAdmiral is due to the problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMCs WinK Development Plans Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more detail One final note I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves reconfirming that ControlM continues to run smoothly since we made the database changes Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week It seems as we have finally got this thing running smoothly After extending the database and troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out hearts content Please tell Ronnie thanks for all his help as well Thanks Again Rusty As a next step could we meet soon after the Thanksgiving Holidays I can arrange to bring an executive from product marketing along if you would like to

Recap Hi Larry Following is Ronnie Sapps summary of the problem resolution for the ControlM installation problems and the reliability and scalability results attained It now appears that most of the problems were caused by the setup of the Oracle database Once we left Thursday evening and through the following day ScheduleM worked flawlessly The new day process was last measured taking less than five minutes for jobs and we approximated job volumes per day This demonstrates the reliability and scalability of ControlM when installed properly I will give you a call to discuss the results and our next steps Thanks Rob Rob Hallberg BMC Software Direct Mobile Original Message From Sapp Ronnie Sent Monday November PM To Rob Hallberg Email Subject FW Recap Rob will you please forward this to Larry Larry Below is the recap we talked about Recap There were outstanding issues New Day process running hrs Jobs not running they were all in Blue or White status Issue number was resolved the day before I arrived by Tech Support working with Rusty Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from mg to mg Also the log stat files were extremely small These files were cleaned out by Rusty however were never increased or set to truncate in Oracle They will fill up again These files need to be set to truncate by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those files We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the daily schedule Issue number According to a diagnostic report the agent machine lost connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what the default settings were set The agent is set to retry every seconds up to times After this period manual activation is required I signed on as CTMAGENT user and ran agmenu Ran option which showed the NIS as down I then signed on as the ControlM user and ran ctmmenu Selected Agent Status Selected List all agent platforms unavailable Agent on BMC was in unavailable status Next Selected option Change agent platform to Available status After doing that all the jobs turned to gray status and started running Cleaned up erroneous agent names defined to ControlMServer I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file varhomectlmreport from this file we could tell when the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped I set up jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies All ran ok I set up aprox another cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on OCSDEV They failed due to not using the correct Owner Rusty knows what the correct owner should be I believed I used CTLM New Day process ran for approx mins Right before leaving Rusty ran a cleandb script which resulted in cleaning out the entire database Fortunately by design we were able to demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to the ControlM Server In less than minutes all was ok When I left there were approx jobs running Of those approx jobs were running cyclic every minutes Which meant on a daily basis approx jobs ran per day Larry I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations These is something thats very subjective As with almost any software the more memory and faster CPU the better To do this correctly we should have our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of your environment and the direction your heading How many jobs per day today near future etc How many Users of ECS How many Servers In your test environment you should be able to run jobs without a major problem Your ECS NT box is on the small size at least in the memory area So your responses might not be as fast as desired Please remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a large number of jobs Therefore database tuning is always recommended These tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities Thanks Ronnie Sapp bmcsoftware INCONTROL Business Unit Software

Cumming choose the BMC product at testing conclusion he would support their decision Smith and Ogg have given no go indications I have received that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation but Jim Oggs lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar conclusion for his situation BMC and EBS both I believe are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this

LondonHere is an update on BMC Based on the following I would say this BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works and in one situation appears to have done so successfully Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of were desired or acceptable and instead offered another pushback WinK certifctn therefore BMC doesnt appear to have been given further opportunity to identify what issues if any are still open at Net Works I dont see evidence either in these notes OR having come out from any of the many telephone conversations Ive been in that Net Works has provided any responses since or soPeter Goebel and I met wNet Works EBS on and I have had no calls or emails responding to my requests for information relative to what are your top problems in this BMC situation Net Works from Net Works So I feel confident that there are more issues left off the table by Net Works than will be discussed because Net Works doesnt want any of BMCs solutions Period The Result EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC as far as Net Works folks are concerned In the I dont want any surprises mode I thought Id give George a headsup re possible fallout around the BMC thing I told George in this mornings staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team I dont see a problem here and what you and I suggested EBS do buy and implement M of BMCs stuff pay M for credit which any ENE business unit could access etc I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were likely to encourage Crowder to lean on Philippe which I had recommended against

Representative BMC Software Direct Fax Original Message From Hallberg Rob Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc Munson Ann Subject WinK Certification Hi Bruce I have attached a document detailing the status of Microsoft Certification We have also summarized our Windows development and certification methodology which is actually a twophase approach The most critical phase which ensures WinK compatibility and support and includes customer testing has been completed The WinK Agents are GA for both ControlM scheduling and ControlSA security The next phase which is also a key element of our development strategy is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for Microsoft WinK This phase follows the WinK initial release as MS Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the applications functionality ability to work correctly in the ControlM environment Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of the application It is my understanding that one of the reasons ControlM is being considered as a replacement for sysAdmiral is due to the problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMCs WinK Development Plans Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more detail One final note I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves reconfirming that ControlM continues to run smoothly since we made the database changes Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week It seems as we have finally got this thing running smoothly After extending the database and troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out hearts content Please tell Ronnie thanks

Recap Hi Larry Following is Ronnie Sapps summary of the problem resolution for the ControlM installation problems and the reliability and scalability results attained It now appears that most of the problems were caused by the setup of the Oracle database Once we left Thursday evening and through the following day ScheduleM worked flawlessly The new day process was last measured taking less than five minutes for jobs and we approximated job volumes per day This demonstrates the reliability and scalability of ControlM when installed properly I will give you a call to discuss the results and our next steps Thanks Rob Rob Hallberg BMC Software Direct Mobile Original Message From Sapp Ronnie Sent Monday November PM To Rob Hallberg Email Subject FW Recap Rob will you please forward this to Larry Larry Below is the recap we talked about Recap There were outstanding issues New Day process running hrs Jobs not running they were all in Blue or White status Issue number was resolved the day before I arrived by Tech Support working with Rusty Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from mg to mg Also the log stat files were extremely small These files were cleaned out by Rusty however were never increased or set to truncate in Oracle They will fill up again These files need to be set to truncate by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those files We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the daily schedule Issue number According to a diagnostic report the agent machine lost connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what the default settings were set The agent is set to retry every seconds up to times After this period manual activation is required I signed on as CTMAGENT user and ran agmenu Ran option which showed the NIS as down I then signed on as the ControlM user and ran ctmmenu Selected Agent Status Selected List all agent platforms unavailable Agent on BMC was in unavailable status Next Selected option Change agent platform to Available status After doing that all the jobs turned to gray status and started running Cleaned up erroneous agent names defined to ControlMServer I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file varhomectlmreport from this file we could tell when the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped I set up jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies All ran ok I set up aprox another cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on OCSDEV They failed due to not using the correct Owner Rusty knows what the correct owner should be I believed I used CTLM New Day process ran for approx mins Right before leaving Rusty ran a cleandb script which resulted in cleaning out the entire database Fortunately by design we were able to demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to the ControlM Server In less than minutes all was ok When I left there were approx jobs running Of those approx jobs were running cyclic every minutes Which meant on a daily basis approx jobs ran per day Larry I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations These is something thats very subjective As with almost any software the more memory and faster CPU the better To do this correctly we should have our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of your environment and the direction your heading How many jobs per day today near future etc How many Users of ECS How many Servers In your test environment you should be able to run jobs without a major problem Your ECS NT box is on the small size at least in the memory area So your responses might not be as fast as desired Please remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a large number of jobs Therefore database tuning is always recommended These tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities Thanks Ronnie Sapp bmcsoftware INCONTROL Business Unit Software

Cumming choose the BMC product at testing conclusion he would support their decision Smith and Ogg have given no go indications I have received that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone
