undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject Article sent from The Hindu An interesting article Could it happen This article is emailed to you by tushar s dhruv Source The Hindu Dabhol and the do nothing Government By Prem Shankar Jha Ever since the Vajpayees Government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged per cent The decade when it averaged per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched per cent are now but a distant memory Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September terrorist strikes in the US It has now shrunk dramatically vehicle sales dropped by percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly to per cent With no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away By the number will have risen by another three million But Mr Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems But one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boardss attempt to foil Enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement The London Court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court The way has therefore been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations Given the fearsome proficiency of Enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case If that happens then by a conservative estimate India will have to pay around billion in costs and damages In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not billion but more like to billion For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company and it had no say in the matter That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty So the bill will inevitably land at the Centres door And that means the taxpayers door The Centre will have no option but to pay But having done so will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government The answer obviously is no What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate But since no one can possibly run a billion power plant generating MW of power profitably the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company BSES were making to Enron the written down value will not exceed billion Thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a Dabholsize power plant billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a costplus basis Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future For better or for worse the Enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice As a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the Vajpayee Government must honour the countrys contractual obligations This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhols power affordable are known to all As the Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended the Government should buy the million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast In fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need This will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to billion Second the Central Government should buy per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters This was negotiated with the committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to billion The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate With the price of oil having fallen for India to around a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhols power at per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs a unit This will make it entirely viable especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudorural sector The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB renegotiate it with Enron or if Enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhols power nor answer the more basic question how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity Copyrights The Hindu Republication or redissemination of the contents

terminal in Knoxville It is on the Tennessee River and is referred to as East Knoxville It is the only terminal on the Tennessee River however its also the only terminal without pipeline access A few years ago Colonial was connected to this terminal but shutdown the line rather than repair it so the terminal has been isolated from pipeline access KMP is progressing on the pipeline expansion project to Knoxville If Enron or someone else purchases the feeder pipeline to TMG from Colonial and reactivates it KMP could potentially make a connection to that facility Our pipeline expansion into Knoxville is tentatively scheduled to be complete by midyear While Enron is evaluating the above information should KMP send you its package regarding pipeline volume commitments in exchange for

DensleyENRONDEVELOPMENT AT ENRON CMAIL Soon Yeap AT ENRON CMAIL David Haug AT ENRON CMAIL Subject Re PRC Derivatives Trading Rick I would add that the commercial concept itself has to be determined up front similar to Jim Hughes position When we originally talked the concept was that we would be developing the entire chain liquifaction regas which would provide a great deal more volumetric capability of fixed price since we would not need to convert fixed price components the infrastructure to a floating crude basket to begin with and all wed really be having to hedge or swap out to a fixed component was the gas or commodity component itself I recently found out that the latest structure assumed that we would be buying simply at the regas terminal and maybe having some participation in the regas If this is a correct understanding this is a BIG change in what can or cant be done since the floating portion to be hedged would be much larger I also believe that at the time when this discussion took place we assumed that we could take the basket to a real tradeable index as opposed to the J crude cocktail or its equivalent Unfortunately the reality of the recent negotiations confirmed that this would be difficult if not potentially impossible from an existing supplier This is also a big change from the assumptions of where we began We also identified the counterparty credit risk at that point in time and I dont believe that any more work has been done in this area which quite frankly will drive this deal to be workable or not This has been and WILL be the biggest issue to find a solution for in any fixed price LNG sale It all comes down to credit risk I guess that I come down to having a similar concern as Jim Hughes If we havent fully defined what we want to do upstream of the customer then the options that we can present to the customer will be more limited No matter how you slice it the volumes are big so that what may appear to be minor changes will have a major impact on what we can and cant do Jim and Bills group is the right one to help work through these issues I and my team remain ready to help out wherever possible thanks gdr

tried his best as you have suggested below to get something more concrete structured The problem is the same one we faced in the value at risk work done earlier this year for DabholIndia LNGthe concepts are interesting but they break down when one looks at the details because of the huge volumes Hugh is caught in the middle on this because he continues to be told that we should be able to do something but he cant get his arms around anything more concrete In the interim China is asking for meetings and more details and we cant afford to tell them that we dont want to meet with them We

DensleyENRONDEVELOPMENT AT ENRON CMAIL Soon Yeap AT ENRON CMAIL David Haug AT ENRON CMAIL Subject Re PRC Derivatives Trading Rick I would add that the commercial concept itself has to be determined up front similar to Jim Hughes position When we originally talked the concept was that we would be developing the entire chain liquifaction regas which would provide a great deal more volumetric capability of fixed price since we would not need to convert fixed price components the infrastructure to a floating crude basket to begin with and all wed really be having to hedge or swap out to a fixed component was the gas or commodity component itself I recently found out that the latest structure assumed that we would be buying simply at the regas terminal and maybe having some participation in the regas If this is a correct understanding this is a BIG change in what can or cant be done since the floating portion to be hedged would be much larger I also believe that at the time when this discussion took place we assumed that we could take the basket to a real tradeable index as opposed to the J crude cocktail or its equivalent Unfortunately the reality of the recent negotiations confirmed that this would be difficult if not potentially impossible from an existing supplier This is also a big change from the assumptions of where we began We also identified the counterparty credit risk at that point in time and I dont believe that any more work has been done in this area which quite frankly will drive this deal to be workable or not This has been and WILL be the biggest issue to find a solution for in any fixed price LNG sale It all comes down to credit risk I guess that I come down to having a similar concern as Jim Hughes If we havent fully defined what we want to do upstream of the customer then the options that we can present to the customer will be more limited No matter how you slice it the volumes are big so that what may appear to be minor changes will have a major impact on what we can and cant do Jim and Bills group is the right one to help work through these issues I and my team remain ready to help out wherever possible thanks gdr

Re PRC Derivatives Trading Document link not converted Hugh since your meetings have already been scheduled perhaps you should go forward with your road show with a general repeat of the information you have already presented and then try one more time to get some corporate interest in putting together a risk management concept that makes sense Jim We need some help on this one the idea of LNG price risk management for China was introduced in a general way many months ago by Hugh and Soon after much talk with ECT and Geoffs group China is interested and has asked for more details Hugh has tried his best as you have suggested below to get something more concrete structured The problem is the same one we faced in the value at risk work done earlier this year for DabholIndia LNGthe concepts are interesting but they break down when one looks at the details because of the huge volumes Hugh is caught in the middle on this because he continues to be told that we should be able to do something but he cant get his arms around anything more concrete In the interim China is asking for meetings and more details and we cant afford to tell them that we dont want to meet with them We need to either put some hard thinking behind this and come up with something or we need to tell China that LNG tied to crude prices cant be hedged Please advise Rick James A Hughes AM Embedded image

former Dir of Mil History USAFA A friend forwarded this to me I think it well worth reading From Dr Tony Kern Lt Col USAF Ret Recently I was asked to look at the recent events through the lens of military history I have joined the cast of thousands who have written an open letter to Americans Dear friends and fellow Americans September Like everyone else in this great country I am reeling from last weeks attack on our sovereignty But unlike some I am not reeling from surprise As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history I have a different perspective and I think you should hear it This war will be won or lost by the American citizens not diplomatspoliticians or soldiers Let me briefly explain In spite of what the media and even our own government is telling us this act was not committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes This attack was committed by a ferocious intelligent and dedicated adversary Dont take this the wrong way I dont admire these men and I deplore their tactics but I respect their capabilities The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America but also because we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of caves years after we think this war is over just like my fathers generation had to do with the formidable Japanese in the years following WW II These men hate the United States with all of their being and we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment Napoleon perhaps the worlds greatest combination of soldier and statesman stated the moral is to the physical as three is to one Patton thought the Frenchman underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more important in battle than physical strength Our enemies are willing better said anxious to give their lives for their cause How committed are we America And for how long In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction the recent attack demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught to most military officers worldwide namely simplicity security and surprise When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been trained at our own Air War College it made perfect sense to me This was not a random act of violence and we can expect the same sort of military competence to be displayed in the battle to come This war will escalate with a good portion of it happening right here in the good ol US of A These men will not go easily into the night They do not fear us We must not fear them In spite of our overwhelming conventional strength as the worlds only superpower a truly silly term we are the underdog in this fight As you listen to the carefully scripted rhetoric designed to prepare us for the march for war please realize that America is not equipped or seriously trained for the battle ahead To be certain our soldiers are much better than the enemy and we have some excellent counterterrorist organizations but they are mostly trained for hostage rescues airfield seizures or the occasional body snatch which may come in handy We will be fighting a war of annihilation because if their early efforts are any indication our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last man Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming They have already deployed their forces in as many as countries and are likely living the lives of everyday citizens Simply put our soldiers will be tasked with a search and destroy mission on multiple foreign landscapes and the public must be patient and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be worked out For the most part our military is still in the process of redefining itself and presided over by men and women who grew up with and were promoted because they excelled in Cold War doctrine strategy and tactics This will not be linear warfare there will be no clear centers of gravity to strike with high technology weapons Our vast technological edge will certainly be helpful but it will not be decisive Perhaps the perfect metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the terrorists themselves aboard the hijacked aircraft this will be a knife fight and it will be won or lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers not by software or smart bombs We must also be patient with our military leaders Unlike Americans who are eager to put this messy time behind us our adversaries have time on their side and they will use it They plan to fight a battle of attrition hoping to drag the battle out until the American public loses its will to fight This might be difficult to believe in this euphoric time of flag waving and patriotism but it is generally acknowledged that America lacks the stomach for a long fight We need only look as far back as Vietnam when North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap also a military history teacher defeated the United States of America without ever winning a major tactical battle American soldiers who marched to war cheered on by flag waving Americans in were reviled and spat upon less than three years later when they returned Although we hope that Usama Bin Laden is no Giap he is certain to understand and employ the concept We can expect not only large doses of pain like the recent attacks but also less audacious sand in the gears tactics ranging from livestock infestations to attacks at water supplies and power distribution facilities These attacks are designed to hit us in our comfort zone forcing the average American to pay more and play less and eventually eroding our resolve But it can only work if we let it It is clear to me that the will of the American citizenry you and I is the center of gravity the enemy has targeted It will be the fulcrum upon which victory or defeat will turn He believes us to be soft impatient and selfcentered He may be right but if so we must change The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz the most often quoted and least read military theorist in history says that there is a remarkable trinity of war that is composed of the will of the people the political leadership of the government and the chance and probability that plays out on the field of battle in that order Every American citizen was in the crosshairs of last Tuesdays attack not just those that were unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center or Pentagon The will of the American people will decide this war If we are to win it will be because we have what it takes to persevere through a few more hits learn from our mistakes improvise and adapt If we can do that we will eventually prevail Everyone Ive talked to In the past few days has shared a common frustration saying in one form or another I just wish I could do something You are already doing it Just keep faith in America and continue to support your President
