Enforcement Online and Offline In a longawaited address to Privacy FTC Chairman Timothy Muris has announced a new wide ranging privacy agenda and promised to increase enforcement of privacy standards both online and offline It has been unclear for some time just how the Bush Administration would approach consumer privacy in the US and there has been speculation in the wake of the September attacks that this agenda item once so commonly discussed would take a back seat to public security concerns In his speech on October Chairman Muris announced that as part of getting back to business it was time to focus on individual privacy in the commercial realm and on what the FTC itself can do Assuring consumers that privacy promises will be taken seriously Muris promised to increase our enforcement of laws protecting consumer privacy Importantly Chairman Muris announced that the FTC would not itself propose new legislation to accomplish the FTCs privacy goals though there are dozens of bills pending in the th Congress addressing consumer privacy which their advocates vowed to continue to push Instead the clear message of his address was that the FTC would use existing laws regulations and standards to achieve the FTCs privacy agenda The chairman made a point of stating that the FTCs role would no longer be limited to online concerns as has been the case since the FTC began studying online privacy in Instead due to the convergence of online and offline information systems the FTC would expand its activities to consumer privacy issues wherever they may arise FTC Privacy Agenda The FTC Chairman issued a point Privacy Agenda Key points that likely are of most interest to the business community include Enforcement of Privacy Promises FTC will step up its enforcement under Section of the FTC Act which will include inappropriate information transfers under the guise of bankruptcy or reorganizations it will also enforce compliance with the USEU Safe Harbor Privacy Program Encouragement of Consumer Complaints Part and parcel of its enforcement through the FTC Act the FTC will make the complaint process more consumerfriendly Enforcing the GrammLeachBliley Act The FTC will undertake enforcement efforts to ensure that financial institutions comply with the law and will implement an outreach program to increase consumer awareness of the privacy notices The FTC also will increase its enforcement against pretexting by seeking injunctions against information brokers Pretexting involves fraudulently obtaining personal financial

selfregulation standards and evaluation of improved means for assuring information security To achieve the FTCs new agenda Chairman Muris announced an increase of in its privacy enforcement staff from to No Need for More Legislation At Least for Now Despite promises of steppedup enforcement of privacy standards Chairman Muris announced that he thought it was still too early to assess the effectiveness of existing legislation and industry selfregulation on privacy concerns He rejected at least for now new legislation saying that at this time we need more law enforcement not more laws Nevertheless Muris clearly has not been impressed with certain industrys compliance with existing law Regarding the GrammLeachBliley Act he said Acres of trees died to produce a blizzard of barely
