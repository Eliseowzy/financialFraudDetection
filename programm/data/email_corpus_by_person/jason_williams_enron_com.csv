<33100665.1075851752814.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jason.williams@enron.com,1979-12-31 16:00:00,General Issues The following are some issues that I have encountered that merit some attention from a Credit Risk Mgmt standpoint Most of these issues are related to the way other groups within the company do their jobs so we need to think about how much political capital would be expended to make some changes happen and whether it is worth it to fight those battles VERBAL APPROVAL FOR TRADES I spoke to one of the day gas traders last week and she informed me that their group had recently had a meeting to discuss issues related to credit In particular they were discussing the Credit Watch List It was made very clear to those traders that if they executed a transaction with a counterparty on the Watch List without Credit approval that they would be fired This is of course good news and bad news The good news is that we should now be able to better monitor these transactions The bad news is that this puts a burden on Credit to keep the Watch List uptodate We should be doing this but it is an issue of freeing up enough time to review the companies that we think might merit removal from the list Easier said than done The inevitable conclusion of this meetingpronouncement from the traders management is that the traders will now be looking for some way to prove that their trade was approved by Credit This is going to lead to a need COUNTERPARTY NAME ISSUES It is not a new development that traders call down looking to do a trade and they dont know which exact entity that theyre dealing with In most cases we can figure out where a trade needs to be booked and we can do the proper analysis with respect to the trade at hand For the counterparties with whom we have master agreements and do regular business this is not such a big deal we know the parent entities and the associated subs and trading arms However this issue of traders not knowing who they are dealing with is creating a lot of problems for CPRday gas transactions Traders are calling down for approval on monthlyday gas and giving the wrong counterparty name so our credit analysis is absolutely worthless For example I approved a deal for Alain Diza for a small volume of January gas for Fulton County NY Board of Education The total receivable was so I approved the trade reasoning that a county board of education would be able to cover a k bill It turns out that the actual counterparty was Fulton Housing Authority an operator of lowincome housing governed by the New York State Division of Housing This entity has a total of in its bank accounts The solution is to make tradersoriginators accountable for providing the correct counterparty name If credit losses arising from this issue were deducted from the appropriate traders PL then there would be a lot more incentive for them to get the entity specified correctly BACK OFFICE ISSUES It is very difficult for us to chase down the originator of a trade through TAGG because the back office arent doing their jobs well When we have pendings issues we have to chase down the trader through the confirms people or the book admins It is a process that takes too much of our time If the book admins would just put the traders name on the ticket it would save us countless phone calls I have mentioned to Debbie that we need to pound Sally Beck on this issue and she said that she would discuss it with her However Becks group still is not getting it done
