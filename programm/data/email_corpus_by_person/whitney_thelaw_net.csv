information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snag and enhance Thereafter you pay and pay for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really worth times the price of a subscription to TheLawnet particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the US Supreme Court the Federal Circuits the state supreme courts and the intermediate level appellate courts Call you local rep and ask THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT SEARCHABLE CASE LAW In our opinion the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle are their searchable case law databases But we have one too the third largest on earth next to theirs With an annual subscription to TheLawnet Professional Convenience Edition you can search hours a day for an entire year across libraries spanning more than Federal and state appellate jurisdictions for just if you sign up by the end of the month And we dont insult your intelligence by slicing things up Everybody gets everything we have on an unlimited use basis Is that a model youve been waiting for or what See

FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW FLATRATE TheLawnet privately held and successful from Day One represents the next logical step a big improvement over slogging through two billion web pages and otherwise watching legal research costs spiral out of control at a time when with normal free market principles at work such costs would be plummeting In some instances subscribers have found they no longer need to deal with West or Lexis In most instances they have found that the list of expensive resources that they need to buy is much shorter And we always remind them that everything West and Lexis has is available payperview a la carte via the Internet All you need is authorization from your client and a credit card SAVE ON THELAWNET PROFESSIONAL CONVENIENCE EDITION Subscribing to TheLawnet is

the Wexis universe always just a click or two away on the Internet you no longer need to pick and choose resources and interestingly you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions Before

precise time you need it on a payperview basis Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick But thats easy once you know your options USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL TheLawnet Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis bells and whistles For instance using our metasearchable database of four million plus Federal and state appellate judicial opinions you can quickly call up a relevant list of cases that have construed the statute rule reg or cite that you need to learn more about It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt of each case to assess relevancy Whats missing are the little colored arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case For some the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker Others however prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for themselves because at some point in their career something happened which caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing headnotes Depending on the job at hand the mind numbing array of costly high falutin Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document may be very useful or very confusing and unnecessary THE INTERNET AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a relationship

information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snags and enhances Thereafter your organization pays and pays for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really worth times the price of a subscription to TheLawnet particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the US Supreme Court the Federal Circuits the state supreme courts and the intermediate level appellate courts Call you local rep and ask THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT SEARCHABLE CASE LAW In our opinion the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle are their searchable case law databases But we have one too the third largest on earth next to theirs With an annual subscription to TheLawnet Professional Convenience Edition you can search hours a day for an entire year across more than Federal and state appellate jurisdictions for just if

privately held and successful from Day One represents the next logical step a big improvement over slogging through two billion web pages and otherwise watching legal research costs spiral out of control at a time when with normal free market principles at work such costs would be plummeting In some instances subscribers have found they no longer need to deal with West or Lexis In most instances they have found that the list of expensive resources that they need to buy is much shorter And we always remind them that everything West and Lexis has is available payperview a la carte via

two billion pages online that belong a click or two away on your desktop Thats where we come in Proprietary searchable case law aside TheLawnet not West or Lexis is King when it comes to getting you around online WEB BASED PRIMARY AUTHORITY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER There is no longer a debate about whether publicly available web based documents and databases will continue to loom large in the practice of law That debate was completely foreclosed when West recently bought FindLaw for a reported M and Lexis poured a bunch of money into a portal called lexisONE Both companies are now attempting to brand these free sites as the best place to begin when you want to find authoritative information on the public web Are these web sites the best place for seasoned professionals to begin As an attorney you are per se a sophisticated consumer of information Accordingly we invite you to take TheLawnet Challenge and decide for yourself HERE IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT Using lexisONE find Chapter Tax of the Consolidated Laws of New York Do you have a stopwatch or timer ready Good By the way lexisONE is located at Before starting read on for a heads up on a couple of key factors relevant to your assignment Starting at lexisONE should give you a big advantage Why Well to begin with this is Lexis were talking about the same company that just took out a full page ad in the current edition of Law Office Computing which claims in relevant part that if youre a solo or smallfirm attorney the LexisONE service has everything you need to practice more effectively run your office more efficiently and keep up with the latest legal tools and trends So are you ready Are you excited You should be because you are about to discover just how effective and efficient you can be using lexisONE since after all they have everything you need Oh yes One more datapoint before you begin If you are lucky enough to eventually locate the link to the Consolidated Laws of New York that lexisONE provides be forewarned that this link has been DYSFUNCTIONAL for at least the past two weeks Why Well for one thing the State of New York upgraded its massive web site on or about March Since then this portion of lexisONEs site has suffered from a nasty case of LINKROT Translation lexisONE is not current or complete as to some critical primary authority At some point the people at lexisONE obviously determined that the Consolidated Laws of New York were indeed among the items needed to practice more effectively Today it is hard to know what they think WE PROMISED YOU A CHALLENGE Are you skilled enough to PRETEND that the link is working while trying to find it anyway This way you can still get a feel for the effectiveness and efficiency you would have experienced using lexisONE had the link been working Incidentally if using lexisONE you can find this link in less than two minutes you are a God to us Really Now snap back to reality and consider that when you have a subscription to TheLawnet you can view the specific page containing Chapter of the Consolidated Laws in six or seven seconds by simply sliding through our smooth hierarchy of preconfigured Federal and State Statutes Menu Once you locate the law you want to know more about you can enter the statutory cite into our case law search engine check New York from among the Federal and state appellate jurisdictions at your fingertips and quickly pop up a list of relevant cases that have construed the item you need to know more about THELAWNET IS A BETTER MOUSETRAP PERIOD Free web site portals are fine for law students or an occasional reference when you are not under the gun But unless you have complete disregard for your time and your clients best interests if you are browsing the public web for purposes of serious research you should have the right tool for the job Only then will you be as efficient and effective as possible The last thing you need is another illconsidered free web site REMEMBER THAT CASE LAW WE TOLD YOU TO FORGET You can stop forgetting now and consider that subscribers to TheLawnet Professional Legal Browser not only get all of that great case law with a national scope but they receive slick preconfigured menudriven access to more than web based documents and databases including Federal and state statutes rules forms regulations executive agency databases legislative tracking tools every major metropolitan newspaper local rules and forms pattern jury instructions court calendars and contact information expedited pathfinders to most Federal dockets executive agency databases columnists realtime national news and wire services corporate backgrounders polls searchable dictionaries encyclopedias calculators selected law journals and law reviews nearly helpers arranged across dozens of practice areas and much much more If lexisONE has everything you need how can it be that we have more deeplinks to web based documents and databases and more than FindLaw Hmmm THELAWNET THE SUM OF THE ALTERNATIVES Within one business day of New York upgrading their web site subscribers to TheLawnet were informed via a free special email alert that we had updated their software and that the new homepage for the Consolidated Laws is right here legcl As of this writing Sunday April LexisONE is still linked to the old outmoded location cgibinclaws Once this message gets passed around the Net someone at Lexis will see it and fix the broken link We are happy to help out because even when the New York Consolidated and Unconsolidated Law links are finally functional LexisONE still merely provides the following one link to New York Consolidated Laws Homepage one link to New York Unconsolidated Laws Homepage one link to the New York Constitution Homepage Cf THELAWNET PROFESSIONAL BROWSER Linking by Constitutional Article we provide handtitled links to the New York Constitution Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide handtitled links to the New York Consolidated Laws plus one link to the Consolidated Laws Homepage and one link to the Consolidated Laws Index for a total of links Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide handtitled links to the New York Unconsolidated Laws plus one link to the Unconsolidated Laws Homepage for a total of links We provide an additional separate link to the search interface for these laws In total TheLawnet provides handtitled deeplinks just to this discrete subset of New York primary authority LexisONE provides three links and two of them are broken TheLawnet literally removes more than of the time wasted online If you begin with lexisONE or FindLaw you need to add an additional layer of effort to get to specific statutory subject areas of the Consolidated Laws that we completely eliminate with our detailed deeplinks ON THE OTHER HAND LEXISONE MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH Surely lexisONE must have some replicable process in place for maintaining their links But if statutes from a major metropolitan state can disappear from the radar what happens when you have a really important issue to research such as Do Trendy Clothes Catch Trendy Clients We are not lying See for yourself This link works lifestylestylebhtml It could be that our standards are unreasonably high Maybe we should take our lead from LexisNexis Chief Technology Officer Allan McLaughlin who made the following lexisONE observation in the recent article LexisNexis and West Battle Online published by The American Lawyer and lawcom Its not our best product confides McLaughlin but for a lot of lawyers its good enough Good enough Hopefully you are not one of the THOSE lawyers Given the inclusion in our tool of searchable proprietary case law we have tried to clarify some of the differences between a

YOU FIND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DIRECTIVE All subscribers to TheLawnet enjoy unlimited free Reference Support even to the point where we will quickly find the item for you if its out there even ones that are not accessible via the webs best search engines Heres an interactive example of what we mean We are particularly skilled at quickly scraping hardtofind documents from among the two billion plus public web pages in just a few short keystrokes Recently for example a subscriber submitted over our website a request for Reference Support wondering if we could locate Department of Defense Directive Even our massive preconfigured dropdown menu system didnt include this little known document and our frustrated client explained that hes been searching for this item online for more than two years Heres the process we deployed We went to Northernlight one of the great search engines We entered as the search term which returned less than two dozen hits from the more than one billion pages indexed by Northernlight See nlqueryfcgcbqr We scrolled down the first page of results and Hit No caught our eye since the title of the page said Department of Defense and the brief summary text made reference to not but certainly close enough to warrant a mouse click Clicking Hit No we were transported to this page textiptxt We noted based on the url structure that we were definitely trolling deep through the subdirectories of a little known but publicly available US Military web server Note the mil extension in the root directory which identifies US Military web servers We used the Find Function in our browser and jumped to every instance of in the document and noted that while the document had been excerpted on this page it wasnt the official document we were looking for We peeled back the url from textiptxt to text pressed enter and received a message that said You are not authorized to view this page So we again peeled back the url from text to and received a message that said the site had been moved to whsdirectives We happily noted the word directives in the new url and clicked the link Paydirt We landed on the Defense Departments Washington Headquarters Services Directives and Records Division From the homepage we clicked the link captioned Directives which took us to this page whsdirectivescorresdirhtml Again using the browsers Find Function we jumped directly to the link for Directive click and landed here whsdirectivescorreshtmlhtm We selected the PDF version which took us here whsdirectivescorrespdfddppdf THE UPSHOT After printing the document we noted the domain from our final destination and returning to Northernlight we entered it as a search term and noticed that the web server we ultimately found had never been indexed by Northernlight This US military site may well be blocked from indexing robots or it may simply be so new that Northernlights spider has not yet crawled the site No wonder our guy had such a tough time SUMMARY This search was particularly successful because within about seconds we found the official version of what we were looking for However had we NOT been able to find the document using our checklist of efficient search techniques it would have still been a win for our client Why Because we would have been able to all but rule out the possibility that the desired item was available on

beautiful four sedan but its not for everyone bentleypicturegallerybentleyjpg True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut burr oak birds eye maple or black lacquer veneer most would still find the K sticker price out of reach Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition After all burr oak veneer is still veneer WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH Lawyers from coasttocoast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control Many given their firm size practice area or jurisdiction simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis Others have concluded as one guesses they might with the Bentley that after peeling back the veneer these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth THEORY vs REALITY As nice as it might be to own a Bentley it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access only to yank the needle upon graduation What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw Perhaps more to the point what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands Are you

What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary

information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snag and enhance Thereafter you pay and pay for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really worth times the price of a subscription to TheLawnet particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the US Supreme Court the Federal Circuits the state supreme courts and the intermediate level appellate courts Call you local rep and ask THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT SEARCHABLE CASE

Corporation HOMEPAGE REMOVE removehtm If you are a savvy legal compusearcher you will not want to miss this opportunity to take the TheLawnet Challenge below On the other hand if you ever feel challenged when it comes to computer research stay with us We can help Before you begin forget that TheLawnets searchable cases overlap West and Lexis to the tune of more than four million entries across more than Federal and state appellate jurisdictions Just put it out of your mind Forget that it is very easy using our software to quickly learn for yourself how courts have treated the particular cite statute rule or regulation you are interested in learning more about Forget that it is easy for you to quickly pop up cases when all you have is a cite party name author counsel court and so forth Forget that one of the major differences between TheLawnet and The Two Headed Monster is that everyone gets all of our highly usable authoritative data with a national scope all for a low flat rate Finally forget if you can that TheLawnet delivers all of this and much much more on an unlimited use basis directly to your desktop under the following terms and conditions annually for you regularly Save until April for you and a partner annual unlimited use rate Small Office Special for you and four others annual unlimited use rate Workgroup Edition April Enterprise Specials for annual

CDs to chase around the office all you can eat no surprises no gamesmanship day unconditional money back guarantee to subscribe go to our homepage and click SIGN ME UP We recognize that West and Lexis are King when it comes to enhancing public records and churning them in their searchable databases But for all of these highfalutin enhancements one rarely hears the word value uttered in the same sentence with the names of either of these two companies Which leads to some questions that you ought to be asking Q How much are all of these enhancements worth to you Q Are these enhancements timesaving or frustrating Q Does it make sense to continue with onerous annual contracts Q Can the list of expensive items be shortened with low flatrate options Q Rather than switching should you simply redefine relationships with existing vendors in light of less expensive authoritative options Q How can you ever expect to fully leverage publicly available web based documents and databases on behalf of the enterprise in the absence of a set of standards processes and best practices for doing so The answer to the last question is to have a onestop frontend to that subset of the more than two billion pages online that belong a click or two away on your desktop Thats where we come in Proprietary searchable case law aside TheLawnet not West or Lexis is King when it comes to getting you around online WEB BASED PRIMARY AUTHORITY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER There is no longer a debate about whether publicly available web based documents and databases will continue to loom large in the practice of law That debate was completely foreclosed when West recently bought FindLaw for a reported M and Lexis poured a bunch of money into a portal called lexisONE Both companies are now attempting to brand these free sites as the best place to begin when you want to find authoritative information on the public web Are these web sites the best place for seasoned professionals to begin As an attorney you are per se a sophisticated consumer of information Accordingly we invite you to take TheLawnet Challenge and decide for yourself HERE IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT Using lexisONE find Chapter Tax of the Consolidated Laws of New York Do you have a stopwatch or timer ready Good By the way lexisONE is located at Before starting read on for a heads up on a couple of key factors relevant to your assignment Starting at lexisONE should give you a big advantage Why Well to begin with this is Lexis were talking about the same company that just took out a full page ad in the current edition of Law Office Computing which claims in relevant part that if youre a solo or smallfirm attorney the LexisONE service has everything you need to practice more effectively run your office more efficiently and keep up with the latest legal tools and trends So are you ready Are you excited You should be because you are about to discover just how effective and efficient you can be using lexisONE since after all they have everything you need Oh yes One more datapoint before you begin If you are lucky enough to eventually locate the link to the Consolidated Laws of New York that lexisONE provides be forewarned that this link has been DYSFUNCTIONAL for at least the past two weeks Why Well for one thing the State of New York upgraded its massive web site on or about March Since then this portion of lexisONEs site has suffered from a nasty case of LINKROT Translation lexisONE is not current or complete as to some critical primary authority At some point the people at lexisONE obviously determined that the Consolidated Laws of New York were indeed among the items needed to practice more effectively Today it is hard to know what they think WE PROMISED YOU A CHALLENGE Are you skilled enough to PRETEND that the link is working while trying to find it anyway This way you can still get a feel for the effectiveness and efficiency you would have experienced using lexisONE had the link been working Incidentally if using lexisONE you can find this link in less than two minutes you are a God to us Really Now snap back to reality and consider that when you have a subscription to TheLawnet you can view the specific page containing Chapter of the Consolidated Laws in six or seven seconds by simply sliding through our smooth hierarchy of preconfigured Federal and State Statutes Menu Once you locate the law you want to know more about you can enter the statutory cite into our case law search engine check New York from among the Federal and state appellate jurisdictions at your fingertips and quickly pop up a list of relevant cases that have construed the item you need to know more about THELAWNET IS A BETTER MOUSETRAP PERIOD Free web site portals are fine for law students or an occasional reference when you are not under the gun But unless you have complete disregard for your time and your clients best interests if you are browsing the public web for purposes of serious research you should have the right tool for the job Only then will you be as efficient and effective as possible The last thing you need is another illconsidered free web site REMEMBER THAT CASE LAW WE TOLD YOU TO FORGET You can stop forgetting now and consider that subscribers to TheLawnet Professional Legal Browser not only get all of that great case law with a national scope but they receive slick preconfigured menudriven access to more than web based documents and databases including Federal and state statutes rules forms regulations executive agency databases legislative tracking tools every major metropolitan newspaper local rules and forms pattern jury instructions court calendars and contact information expedited pathfinders to most Federal dockets executive agency databases columnists realtime national news and wire services corporate backgrounders polls searchable dictionaries encyclopedias calculators selected law journals and law reviews nearly helpers arranged across dozens of practice areas and much much more If lexisONE has everything you need how can it be that we have more deeplinks to web based documents and databases and more than FindLaw Hmmm THELAWNET THE SUM OF THE ALTERNATIVES Within one business day of New York upgrading their web site subscribers to TheLawnet were informed via a free special email alert that we had updated their software and that the new homepage for the Consolidated Laws is right here legcl As of this writing Sunday April LexisONE is still linked to the old outmoded location cgibinclaws Once this message gets passed around the Net someone at Lexis will see it and fix the broken link We are happy to help out because even when the New York Consolidated and Unconsolidated Law links are finally functional LexisONE still merely provides the following one link to New York Consolidated Laws Homepage one link to New York Unconsolidated Laws Homepage one link to the New York Constitution Homepage Cf THELAWNET PROFESSIONAL BROWSER Linking by Constitutional Article we provide handtitled links to the New York Constitution Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide handtitled links to the New York Consolidated Laws plus one link to the Consolidated Laws Homepage and one link to the Consolidated Laws Index for a total of links Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide handtitled links to the New York Unconsolidated Laws plus one link to the Unconsolidated Laws Homepage for a total of links We provide an additional separate link to the search interface for these laws In total TheLawnet provides handtitled deeplinks just to this discrete subset of New York primary authority LexisONE provides three links and two of them are broken TheLawnet literally removes more than of the time wasted online If you begin with lexisONE or FindLaw you need to add an additional layer of effort to get to specific statutory subject areas of the Consolidated Laws that we completely eliminate with our detailed deeplinks ON THE OTHER HAND LEXISONE MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH Surely lexisONE must have some replicable process in place for maintaining their links But if statutes from a major metropolitan state can disappear from the radar what happens when you have a really important issue to research such as Do Trendy Clothes Catch Trendy Clients We are not lying See for yourself This link works lifestylestylebhtml It could be that our standards are unreasonably high Maybe we should take our lead from LexisNexis Chief Technology Officer Allan McLaughlin who made the following lexisONE observation in the recent article LexisNexis and West Battle Online published by The American Lawyer and lawcom Its not our best product confides McLaughlin but for a lot of lawyers its good enough Good enough Hopefully you are not one of the THOSE lawyers Given the inclusion in our tool of searchable proprietary case law we have tried to clarify some of the differences between a

information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snags and enhances Thereafter your organization pays and pays for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really worth times the price of a subscription to TheLawnet particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card How much would you

information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snags and enhances Thereafter your organization pays and pays for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really

information age do so many continue to pay so much to West and Lexis There is an excellent answer to this question Enhancements YOU OWN THE LAW West and Lexis do not own the law You do Your tax dollars already paid for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities data that West and Lexis snags and enhances Thereafter your organization pays and pays for a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such as tedious training seminars repeated calls to tech support and an overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference tasks there has to be a better faster easier less expensive answer Are all of these enhancements really worth times the price of a subscription to TheLawnet particularly when West and Lexis are available on the web whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the US Supreme Court the Federal Circuits the state supreme courts and the intermediate level appellate courts Call you local rep and ask THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT SEARCHABLE CASE LAW In our opinion the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle are their searchable case law databases But we have one too the third largest on earth next to theirs With an annual subscription to TheLawnet Professional Convenience Edition you can search hours a day for an entire year across more than Federal and state appellate jurisdictions for just if

beautiful four sedan but its not for everyone bentleypicturegallerybentleyjpg True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut burr oak birds eye maple or black lacquer veneer most would still find the K sticker price out of reach Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition After all burr oak veneer is still veneer WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH Lawyers from coasttocoast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control Many given their firm size practice area or jurisdiction simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis Others have concluded as one guesses they might with the Bentley that after peeling back the veneer these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth THEORY vs REALITY As nice as it might be to own a Bentley it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access only to yank the needle upon graduation What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw Perhaps more to the point what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing or are you in a pickandchoose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues What do you do when you have to research across state lines What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary

beautiful four door sedan but its not for everyone bentleypicturegallerybentleyjpg True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut burr oak birds eye maple or black lacquer veneer most would still find the K sticker price out of reach Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition After all burr oak veneer is still veneer WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH Lawyers from coasttocoast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control Many given their firm size practice area or jurisdiction simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis Others have concluded as one guesses they might with the Bentley that after peeling back the veneer these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth THEORY vs REALITY As nice as it might be to own a Bentley it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access only to yank the needle upon graduation What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw Perhaps more to the point what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing or are you in a pickandchoose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues What do you do when you have to research across state lines What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary
