In view of this I attach a note which sets out our logical arguments for not remaining part of a global programme To answer some of your questions more specifically We have got an indication of current market premiums from our broker Steve Wynne he has not alerted the market Steve has been our broker since and until recently worked for JLT He now has his own company Kingsbridge but retains a business arrangement with JLT Steve has extensive knowledge of the UK water industry and has serviced Wessex to a very high standard over the years Steve would use all the major UK carriers to establish a programme but I would expect using Royal Sun Alliance and Winterthur at least as we have previously done as they are very active in the UK water sector We do not have any intentions to use a captive our existing one is currently being liquidated as in essence there are very little advantages of doing so Steve and Wessex have just begun the renewals process for the local policies Also understand Steve contacted McGriff about global policy renewals but got very little response All renewals are less than months away and information gathering is beginning Suggest we need to resolve this issue over the next few weeks Wessex recognises it is a subsidiary company and Enron has significant buying power However for the reasons set out we still think it makes more sense to have its own standalone programme topped up by Enron if needs be I am happy to discuss or meet on any of this Mark Original Message From mailto Sent September To Cc Subject RE Wessex Insurances I will be happy to meet with Mr Harris I do have travel plans for the first week in October Hopefully I will be here during his visit Please advise when you have definitive dates Original Message From Mark Watts ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESMarkWattsCmarkEwattswessexwaterEcoEukE NRONcom Sent Tuesday September AM To Bouillion James L Mark Watts Cc Hayslett Rod Clayton Paul Kendall Earline Subject RE Wessex Insurances I am more than happy to answer these questions However my boss Keith Harris Director of Finance and Regulation is going to be in Houston in a couple of weeks and I believe he is going to try and meet with you as a face to face discussion will probably prove more beneficial Original Message From mailto Sent September To Cc Subject RE Wessex Insurances The trade with the parents and associated companies is really an allocation of premium as opposed to a purchase from the parent There was a separate insurance program purchased to cover all the Azurix assets and the premium was allocated to the participants Wessex received a portion of the premium through the allocation Due to our extensive regulated pipeline system we are familiar with the issues related to the regulatory scrutiny of allocated premiums The pipelines include allocated premiums in their rate case and historically we have been successful in supporting the amounts charged On what are you basing your statement that the Azurix allocation to Wessex is not competitive Have you priced coverage in the market I would be very interested in the information that you have received as our only data points would be your premium levels when we acquired Wessex As you will recall Enron left your program in place initially Azurix placed their own program in December of and your program was terminated at that time This is only the second year of the Azurix program The market has hardened considerably over the past two years Once the North America assets are sold the Azurix program will be remarketed Dec for the four remaining water companies and a small US exposure if any remains This would be a portfolio of assets with similar operations and I would not anticipate Wessex supporting the rest of the Azurix program We could also consider providing coverage under the Enron program if it fits If you have not gone to the market how would you propose doing so in order to secure stand alone pricing What brokers and markets would you plan to use Do you plan to return to using a captive for certain coverages Please advise Original Message From Mark Watts ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESMarkWattsCmarkEwattswessexwaterEcoEukE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Bouillion James L Subject Wessex Insurances Jim Thanks for your email of August informing us that a decision had been made to keep Wessex insurances under the existing Azurix global programme or to ultimately absorb the whole of Azurix into an Enron programme Whilst we understand this we are concerned that a continuation of the global policies at the current cost to Wessex will raise some regulatory problems for us in the UK Our Licence requires us to report trades with parents and associated companies and to demonstrate that any such trades are undertaken at arms length Moreover we are required to periodically test such arrangements Clearly this has not been done in respect of Insurance Even more worrying is the fact that the cost of the Global insurance programme to Wessex is simply not competitive The current level of premiums we pay when added to the much higher excess levels we incur are in excess of what we could arrange on a standalone basis Going forward if Wessex is to support the rest of the Azurix programme our costs can only but rise In light of these problems we either have to reduce the cost of the Global policies to Wessex or allow Wessex to obtain standalone cover Regards Mark Watts Treasurer This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or
