outlook Objective of the document The document serves as a briefing paper for a visit that has a specific object the promotion of the LNG Project The evaluation therefore should be made in that light and at most in reference to future Enron projects basically constrained to the gas business downstream References to the Oil industry and given the comments below to the Hydrocarbons Law should be minimized as they are of marginal importance The document on the political outlook on the other hand sufficiently covers the implications of a reduction in oil revenues Gas Law vs Hydrocarbons Law It is not only my belief but of many participants in the industry that the Gas Law will be preserved as it is and will not be abrogated by the new Hydrocarbons Law The source of the confusion might be that the Hydrocarbons Law will encompass the Exploration and Production of associated gas gas associated to the production of oil The other stages as well as EP of nonassociated or free gas are regulated by the Gas Law Therefore all references to this issue should be eliminated Hydrocarbons Law The only copy of the Hydrocarbons Law available for review is the original draft that was part of the set of energy laws that were approved in Electricity Mines and Gas It was acknowledged that the original Hydrocarbons Law had significant deficiencies and for this reason it was delayed Currently only a petit committee is working on the new version basically the Ministrys Counsel and the Minister himself A high ranking official assured me that the draft would be circulated among investors before approval to repeat the success achieved with the Telecommunications Law The draft in circulation that BTW was very hard to find given its deficiencies however clearly stipulates that it does not cover the nonassociated gas PDVSA as policymaker Some actions by the Chavez Administration are highly rational and in the interests of the investors see my comments to the political outlook document For example the fact that PDVSA is loosing its ability to set policies is in theory appropriate It must be recognized that PDVSA as a monopoly of the Venezuelan Oil and Gas Industry behaves like one Therefore the policies it sets are in its interests and not necessarily in the interest of the industry or the country An example is tariffs for integrated operations In this respect the Gas Law clearly separates the activities of production transportation and distribution in order to minimize the exercise of monopoly power MEM as policymaker It must be acknowledged that the Ministry of Energy and Mines lacks many tools and abilities to formulate policies but also that they are making a significant effort to overcome these shortcomings MEM is handling very complex processes and naively believed that they could produce all the regulations within an unrealistic time frame This lack of experience as well as lack of leadership I must admit is the source of delays Contract renegotiations Contract renegotiations have been made at the request of investors Some investors are loosing money big time but this is the nature of the EP business no wonder we got out of it Quality of PDVSA personnel It is acknowledged that PDVSA is not the best run company in the world and that a significant human capital has been lost in recent years It is my experience as well as others in Enron however that there is still people sophisticated enough to do business with as evidenced in the complexity of the Gas Supply Agreement and the Participation Agreement of the LNG Project and the regulations and tariffs of transportation services ENAGAS the regulatory entity not ENERGAS It is acknowledged that ENAGAS lacks independence from the Administration that it is little developed and that it is still not fully formed I have had two meetings with the heads of the regulatory agency explaining who we are what we want and how we plan to achieve it and they responded with clear goals admitted the conflicts they face and how they plan to do about them We are not completely satisfied with the results but now there is a much better understanding of what each is looking for and more hope that the project will go forward I honestly believe that the document requires significant redrafting in particular those aspects that highlight risks immaterial to the project such as the behavior of the domestic market in the short term or that are speculative eg the behavior of large foreign firms contradictory eg breakeven of per capita in oil revenue vs growth in GDP with only per capita in oil revenues andor repetitive I have specific comments that I think would be more effective if I gave them to you verbally Please call me if you have any questions ALF Robert CT PM To

<27496252.1075844193722.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alberto.levy@enron.com,2001-01-31 10:36:00,Re Venezuela Briefing Paper Cc in blue below Robert CT AM To Alberto NRON cc Scott nron Emilio VicensENRON NRONDEVELOPMENt Subject Re Venezuela Briefing Paper Alberto thanks for the quickturnaround on your comments As I said on the phone last night we are working on a short deadline as well Before making the changes you suggest it would be helpful to get clarification on a couple of points Objective of the document our groups task is not to promote the LNG Project I think that Mike McConnell and his team want multiple data points on this issue including both ours and yours We were asked specific questions about political economic and regulatory risk in Venezuela first by the RAC Group and then by Mike McConnell At the same time we want to be fair and accurate which is why you and Emilio are involved in the process That said I will review the document to ensure that it is not excessively skewed toward oil issues although Emilio will note there have already been major changes from the first draft I will also add your comments to the Energy and the Venezuelan Economy from the first paper Gas Law vs Hydrocarbons Law I seem to be getting a little bit of a mixed message here either we know what will be in the new law or we dont Our sources have said that it will synthesize but not fundamentally change the Gas Law then why bother essentially applying the gas royalty tax structure to liquid hydrocarbons I believe that what the new law might say is that the royalty scheme for the free gas will apply to the gas associated with oil production which is under the scope of the Hydrocarbons Law The tax structure for liquid hydrocarbons is specified in the Income Tax law which was recently changed to reflect the current tax structure ie for oil and for gas both associated and free I havent heard any rumors about changes in the the Income Tax law Two issues here seem important first the fact that there is uncertainty about the laws contents Yes there is but the promise that it will be circulated among investors and that their opinions will be seriously considered mitigates those risks Second the apparent fact that the sliding scale for gas royalties might be eliminated I hope the point above clarifies the issue I will definitely add your point about the plans to circulate the law to investors for review and would appreciate clarification on these other points PDVSA as a policymaker tough one here Please look at the incentives here Who has incentives better aligned with Enron My biggest concern about PDVSA and MEM is the fact that there has been delays to the auctions for the upstream gas projects Shouldnt Enron look at this as a possible problem for our project and a sign of possible regulatory delayconfusion I strongly believe that the regulatory risks for the LNG projects are less significant than what might be expected First since this is an export project domestic regulations do not apply The terms and conditions prices volumes guarantees and penalties are governed by the contracts between Enron and PDVSA Participation by the Ministry is to approve these contracts The only significant regulatory risk is that once exports start if the domestic market is not satisfied for lack of gas the goverment abrogates the contract this was the case for PanamaColombia pipeline for example We successfully removed this possibility This scenario given the abundant reserves is unlikely however see for example the Bolivian case I reject the notion that the government is trying to setup investors Naivete perhaps lack of experience all of the world but no bad intentions here MEM as policymaker PDVSA personnel and ENAGAS I think that we fundamentally agree on these points and I will add your comments about the experience of Enron people with PDVSA and with respect to ENAGAS being headed in the right direction With respect to gas royalties Emilio left me message indicating that there was uncertainty concerning how they will be calculated As I understand Im not saying that I agree royalties will be calculated the following way Independently of what Enron pays to PDVSA for the gas the royalty will be imposed at the hub price MEM envisions three hubs in Venezuela The relevant hub will be Anaco From that hub price all the costs to take the gas to the hub such as gathering processing and transportation will be substracted and not added This will fix the royalty at the well head gas Multiplied by the volume ala the amount of royalties to pay This methodology should be out in about a month Again I think that it is important to point out these kinds of uncertainties to the EGM executives reviewing the deal Emilio also mentioned that the royalties will be paid by the gas supplier to Enronbut wouldnt these costs ultimately be passed through to Enron Help me clarify this point PoliticalEconomic paper congrats for your superb comments here which I accept virtually unchanged The only questions I have concern inflation which I will revisit with my contacts for the Institute of International Finance in Washington and the telecoms law Your estimates of inflation are in line with our expectations With respect to the telecoms law what was the timing of its passage Depending on how you count because it was in the works for a long time but debates on the law that was finally passed lasted about a year I must admit that there was a lot of pressure to pass the law because the concession to the basic telephone service monopoly was about to expire and therefore the law received fasttrack to be approved in time for the introduction of competition Experiences of other firmswe have specifically been asked to look at this question All the majors except ExxonMobil Shell has marginal involvement but has significant investments in gasoline distribution in the operative and profitsharing agreements For example BPAmoco is deeply involved Chevron has the largest oil field in Venezuela bpd All the majors in one way or another have significant investments in Venezuela I any event the pressure to renegotiate the contracts except the WilliamsEnbridge whos terms were grossly beneficial to them and most people agree that the country was being ripped off come from the investors Can you shed more light on where you think we are being speculative However companies like Shell are likely to stay away and pursue only technical studies over the next several years waiting the next down cycle for the economy It is important to note that the question of gas tariffs are seen as a low priority by the Chavez government which views oil exports as the easiest and most lucrative source of revenue for the state The allencompassing goal of expanded fiscal returns from energy production and exports centers around oil A perceived gas deficit the need for additional gas to compensate pressure loss at the wells the realization that gas is an important component in the strategy to industrialize the country is creating pressures within the government to finally get the process going Relevant people is working hard world class consultants have been brought onboard We believe theres a real chance that the gas bidding rounds will be completed this year Lets take one more crack at this this morning before we submit

NRONDEVELOPMENt Subject Re Venezuela Briefing Paper Alberto thanks for the quickturnaround on your comments As I said on the phone last night we are working on a short deadline as well Before making the changes you suggest it would be helpful to get clarification on a couple of points Objective of the document our groups task is not to promote the LNG Project I think that Mike McConnell and his team want multiple data points on this issue including both ours and yours We were asked specific questions about political economic and regulatory risk in Venezuela first by the RAC Group and then by Mike McConnell At the same time we want to be fair and accurate which is why you and Emilio are involved in the process That said I will review the document to ensure that it is not excessively skewed toward oil issues although Emilio will note there have already been major changes from the first draft I will also add your comments to the Energy and the Venezuelan Economy from the first paper Gas Law vs Hydrocarbons Law I seem to be getting a little bit of a mixed message here either we know what will be in the new law or we dont Our sources have said that it will synthesize but not fundamentally change the Gas Law then why bother essentially applying the gas royalty tax structure to liquid hydrocarbons I believe that what the new law might say is that the royalty scheme for the free gas will apply to the gas associated with oil production which is under the scope of the Hydrocarbons Law The tax structure for liquid hydrocarbons is specified in the Income Tax law which was recently changed to reflect the current tax structure ie for oil and for gas both associated and free I havent heard any rumors about changes in the the Income Tax law Two issues here seem important first the fact that there is uncertainty about the laws contents Yes there is but the promise that it will be circulated among investors and that their opinions will be seriously considered mitigates those risks Second the apparent fact that the sliding scale for gas royalties might be eliminated I hope the point above clarifies the issue I will definitely add your point about the plans to circulate the law to investors for review and would appreciate clarification on these other points PDVSA as a policymaker tough one here Please look at the incentives here Who has incentives better aligned with Enron My biggest concern about PDVSA and MEM is the fact that there has been delays to the auctions for the upstream gas projects Shouldnt Enron look at this as a possible problem for our project and a sign of possible regulatory delayconfusion I strongly believe that the regulatory risks for the LNG projects are less significant than what might be expected First since this is an export project domestic regulations do not apply The terms and conditions prices volumes guarantees and penalties are governed by the contracts between Enron and PDVSA Participation by the Ministry is to approve these contracts The only significant regulatory risk is that once exports start if the domestic market is not satisfied for lack of gas the goverment abrogates the contract this was the case for PanamaColombia pipeline for example We successfully removed this possibility This scenario given the abundant reserves is unlikely however see for example the Bolivian case I reject the notion that the government is trying to setup investors Naivete perhaps lack of experience all of the world but no bad intentions here MEM as policymaker PDVSA personnel and ENAGAS I think that we fundamentally agree on these points and I will add your comments about the experience of Enron people with PDVSA and with respect to ENAGAS being headed in the right direction With respect to gas royalties Emilio left me message indicating that there was uncertainty concerning how they will be calculated As I understand Im not saying that I agree royalties will be calculated the following way Independently of what Enron pays to PDVSA for the gas the royalty will be imposed at the hub price MEM envisions three hubs in Venezuela The relevant hub will be Anaco From that hub price all the costs to take the gas to the hub such as gathering processing and transportation will be substracted and not added This will fix the royalty at the well head gas Multiplied by the volume ala the amount of royalties to pay This methodology should be out in about a month Again I think that it is important to point out these kinds of uncertainties to the EGM executives reviewing the deal Emilio also mentioned that the royalties will be paid by the gas supplier to Enronbut wouldnt these costs ultimately be passed through to Enron Help me clarify this point PoliticalEconomic paper congrats for your superb comments here which I accept virtually unchanged The only questions I have concern inflation which I will revisit with my contacts for the Institute of International Finance in Washington and the telecoms law Your estimates of inflation are in line with our expectations With respect to the telecoms law what was the timing of its passage Depending on how you count because it was in the works for a long time but debates on the law that was finally passed lasted about a year I must admit that there was a lot of pressure to pass the law because the concession to the basic telephone service monopoly was about to expire and therefore the law received fasttrack to be approved in time for the introduction of competition Experiences of other firmswe have specifically been asked to look at this question All the majors except ExxonMobil Shell has marginal involvement but has significant investments in gasoline distribution in the operative and profitsharing agreements For example BPAmoco is deeply involved Chevron has the largest oil field in Venezuela bpd All the majors in one way or another have significant investments in Venezuela I any event the pressure to renegotiate the contracts except the WilliamsEnbridge whos terms were grossly beneficial to them and most people agree that the country was being ripped off come from the investors Can you shed more light on where you think we are being speculative However companies like Shell are likely to stay away and pursue only technical studies over the next several years waiting the next down cycle for the economy It is important to note that the question of gas tariffs are seen as a low priority by the Chavez government which views oil exports as the easiest and most lucrative source of revenue for the state The allencompassing goal of expanded fiscal returns from energy production and exports centers around oil A perceived gas deficit the need for additional gas to compensate pressure loss at the wells the realization that gas is an important component in the strategy to industrialize the country is creating pressures within the government to finally get the process going Relevant people is working hard world class consultants have been brought onboard We believe theres a real chance that the gas bidding rounds will be completed this year Lets take one more crack at this this morning before we submit

separation has been going on for weeks and we take it with mixed feelings In terms of the Jose LNG project we dont foresee significant impacts as the Project only is an offtaker o f gas ie purely physical and commercial nonperformance is not an issu e The contracts being negotiated with PDVSA have enough protections for no ndelivery of gas As you probably already know PDVSA has an option to bec ome a partner in the venture and now we might have this entity and not PDVS A as a partner which might be an issue when making cash calls if the even t happens I presume that will be taken care in the JV agreement since this is standard practice in the event of cash calls for example for an expan sion the partner not contributing the cash would be diluted Of course we would prefer to have PDVSA as a partner because we see them financially mo re solid In any event both are stateowned and both would be responding t o the same policies set by the MEM If things are done the right way there would be a complete separation betw een the gas and the oil industry and this would be good for us To make a f inal assessment however we need a significant amount of information that is not available yet We need that information to answer questions such as Who will be the owner of the gas associated with oil production If it is the new entity otherwise it would not make a lot of sense making the separ ation then PDVSAs EP would be required to buy gas at the tariffs set by the MEM If there is a buyer who is willing to pay a higher price then th e new entity will make the case that it prefers to sell to that entity Mor eover PDVSA EP would need to make clear how much gas it needs to sign the appropriate contracts which will force an increase in the efficiency of t he gas it uses hopefully increasing the transparency of the sector Right now PDVSA EP buys gas at a transfer price set internally probably at pri ces significantly lower than the tariff PDVSA EP is the largest user of g as in the country accounting for more than half the consumption Another question is how the gas owned by the new entity will be priced if nonassociated gas is priced differently from associated gas Will it have the autonomy to sign contracts of course with the blessing of the MEM W ill the terms already negotiated with the Jose LNG be accepted How much po litical intervention will the new entity have Who will stay So far the only people that have taken actions against the split are the em ployees themselves because they are concerned about the benefits they enjoy There has been some strikes and demonstrations due to the separation The main benefit that I see is that it will make the price for EP explicit because we are dealing with two separate companies and will allow other parties to search for gas or its replacement such as Nitrogen which under current plants would be three times the size of our project and sign cont racts with PDVSA EP if that is cheaper All this assumes an economic ratio nality that we have not seen in the sector and therefore nothing might cha nge Ill keep you posted with any other developments Regards ALF FromRichard nronXgate on AM ToAlberto nron cc

Until now gas has always been placed in line behind oil at PDVSA said Vierma We need a company that will focus on gas He added that the as yet unnamed company will start operations before the end of

billion a year earlier The new company is being created as the South American country has increase d its emphasis on natural gas production Venezuela sold rights to six natural gas tracts in June the first time since it nationalized the oil and gas industry in that private companies could participate in the exploration and production of natural gas Critics said the removing natural gas production
