step forward in California electricity market design appear s in the proposal offered by the California Independent System Operator CA ISO The CAISO paper is the focus of immediate discussion with its stakeh olders in anticipation of a market design reform to be filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC This proposal has farreaching and i mportant implications The parallel discussions on standard market design at FERC must take this CAISO proposal as strong testimony adding support fo r the Northeast market model that has been shown to work The Midwest Syst em Operator should be further encouraged in its market design since it alre ady incorporates the insights now reported in California Texans should lo ok with concern at the Texas wholesale market design that bears a strong re semblance to the original California model now explained as built on false premises The rest of the west should applaud and embrace the simple cando r of the CAISO and get moving with a standard market design that respects t he common physics of transmission systems European regulators and market participants should save years of agony and expense trying to build a viabl e electricity market built on the same false premises that California now e xposes Californias market meltdown starting in June reverberated aro und the world The high prices and market collapse have been cited in many policy discussions as the reason to reverse course on electricity restruct uring As bad as it was the California market collapse was made much wors e by factors unique to California in the retail market And this has distr acted many from learning the lessons about wholesale market design that hav e much greater relevance beyond Californias borders Californias was the most prominent market design built on the fall acy that the special characteristics of the electricity transmission grid w ere just details that could be ignored when designing the market Built on a faith that decentralized trading could solve all problems the original California wholesale market design embraced a philosophy that emphasized tr ading and minimized the role of the essential system operator The key bad ideas have been discussed at length elsewhere see www whogancom Central elements included simplifications supposedly inten ded to make the market better for traders In place of the reality of many locations with important impacts on transmission constraints the design r elied on a few large pricing zones In place of a realistic model of the t ransmission grid the design used a socalled commercial network model that ignored critical features of the grid In place of pointtopoint financi al transmission rights the design employed interface rights between zones In place of economic dispatch coordinated by the system operator the des ign relied on decentralized trading that embraced artificially separated ma rkets for ancillary services and ad hoc balancing rules for realtime adjus tments In place of a coordinated energy spot market the design imposed a separate power exchange and balanced scheduling requirements This flawed wholesale market design did not work From the very be ginning problems appeared and by the end of the FERC had rejected the many attempts to fix the superstructure without rebuilding the foundation Congestion Management Reform soon became Comprehensive Market Redesign Although the reform effort was overtaken by later events the failure of th e California wholesale market design should be a warning for every other ma rket that has embraced its philosophy and adopted its details Now the CAISO has taken up the serious task of fixing what is broke n No longer constrained to be politically correct in defending the ideolo gical errors that drove the earlier design process the CAISO reports the s imple truth Upon reexamination of the Congestion Management Reform pro posal we find that some of the crucial assumptions underlying the Locati onal Pricing Areas concept break downCAISO p The assumpt ions were crucial and flawed Trying to make the market simpler than is po ssible turned out not to be possible in reality the simplicity of the zonal system only appears so becau se the complexity is assumed away allowing market participants to ignore i t in scheduling while the CAISO must manage it through real time adjustment s and periodic modifications to the rules to mitigate novel gaming strategi es as they arrive it will be far simpler and more transparent to de sign forward congestion management procedures to be as consistent as poss ible with the realtime operating needs of the gridCAISO p Amen The CAISO paper elaborates on the implications and outlines a new d irection that is a major break with its past The same design lesson was l earned earlier in the Northeast markets including PJM New York and New Eng land Similar insights can be found in welldesigned wholesale markets in other countries from Chile to New Zealand Given its prominence in promoting a fallacy its failure in practic e and now its complete reversal on the basic principles Californias turn around should be a pivotal moment that captures attention in the arcane wor ld of electricity market design The changes now proposed for California would be fundamental and sw eeping Once reality is acknowledged the range of possible market designs narrows substantially The pieces must fit together Prices have to refl ect actual operations And the system operator must perform certain functi ons in a way that supports the public interest in an efficient and effectiv e wholesale market The centerpiece would be a coordinated spot market org anized as a bidbased securityconstrained economic dispatch with nodal p rices This can support bilateral transactions with transmission usage cha rged at the difference in nodal prices Pointtopoint financial transmiss ion rights would provide the economic equivalent of otherwise unworkable ph ysical transmission rights This design works in theory and in practice The CAISO proposal is a beginning but still tentative embrace of th is standard market design along with consistent dayahead markets and unit commitment The CAISO needs to go further and some of the ideas require c lose scrutiny For example the suggested introduction of an available cap acity market would be new to California and the concept is not fully develo ped in the proposal but this is not much different than the rest of the co untry where design of capacity markets is problematic There is much yet t o be done with the stakeholders and then at FERC However the CAISO deserves recognition and support for its candor and the intelligence of its proposal for the basic elements of the market d esign Enlightened market participants and leaders responsible for the pub lic interest should resist any effort to compromise this essential reform o r silence the truth The CAISO has taken a long step in the right directio n Everyone interested in the success of electricity restructuring sho uld hope that Californians complete the journey soon We know what to do and we cant afford to get it wrong
