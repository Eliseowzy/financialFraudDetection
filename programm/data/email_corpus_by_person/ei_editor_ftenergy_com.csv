protocol process sparked a response that he clearly did not expect both at home and abroad Indeed this and other recent events suggest the American public is significantly more engaged in environmental issues than the administration believed Despite attempts to repair this image with photo ops in the Everglades and elsewheremoves that played in the mainstream press as hopelessly contrivedthe presidents strategy has eroded support among environmentally conscious moderates and threatens development initiatives that require this trust A recent Washington PostABC News Poll concluded that a full of the public disapproves of how President Bush is handling the energy situation an increase of since a survey conducted four weeks ago Further half of the public disapproves of his actions on environmental issues up since April while approve Given this there is growing speculation that the fight to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR may be overbefore it even beganespecially now that the Democrats have Senate control We already think we have the votes in the Senate even by simple majority without a filibuster to defeat any bill that includes arctic drilling said Melinda Pierce spokesperson for the Sierra Club This begs the question Why is the Bush administration showing such tenacity on this issue While President Bush may be fulfilling campaign promises there is also the idea circulating that this is a stalking horse speculates Pierce President Bush may be pushing ANWR despite continued setbacks in order to eventually give in This could give him a legislative bargaining chip to get access to other restricted areas in for example the Rocky Mountains Read the entire story at Also catch the latest news headlines on Energy Insight Executive
