to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc Well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour Moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office We need for you andor your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc Thanks Iris

You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc Well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour Moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office We need for you andor your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc Thanks Iris

to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc Well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour Moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office We need for you andor your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc Thanks Iris

Kulatilaka of Boston University Hi Iris I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron One is as a financial economist The other as the Director of the newly formed Global Mobility Innovation Initiative GMII this is the research project funded by Lucent involving BU LBS and INSEAD to study various aspects of the mobile Internet read G On the former I am working with a couple of PhD students in understanding a details of how having physical supply inventory can be used by a market maker This is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth I think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground b how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market This is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another All of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models But they are real in practice My impression is Enrons real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining c how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals financials credit etc This is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore include nonlinear risk profiles The story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets Enron has been moving into over the last few years On the GMII front I think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber I am working with several people at Lucent on this issue I think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues Perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call Clearly having Vince Kaminski in the room would be very important to me As for schedules the first weeks of April are horrible April May are good for me Regards Nalin At PM Mack Iris wrote Hi As we briefly discussed I spoke with one of my colleagues Dr Martin Lin about your visiting Enron to give a talk and to spend some time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications real options etc Martin and I are working on various broadband related problems We thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about the following When you want to come The research group has weekly catered lunch on Thursday and brown bag lunches on every other Friday A description of what you want to talk about with respect to telecoms broadband etc Who you would like to meet with me Vince Kaminski our boss any other of our colleagues in research broadband etc etc Look forward to hearing from you

<5337926.1075856423178.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,iris.mack@enron.com,2001-04-17 12:19:00,Data for Moodys RiskCalc Cc Kim As you know I have obtained a day trial subscription to Moodys RiskCalc You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc Well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour Moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about Enrons counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc We have obtained some information on Enrons European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office We need for you andor your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enrons North American counterparties More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia We look forward to receiving this information for Enrons private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc Thanks Iris
