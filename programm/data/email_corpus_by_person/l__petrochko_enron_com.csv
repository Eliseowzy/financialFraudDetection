the FCC Some of these issues would be of interest to EBS but I am afraid the timing may be too late Original Message From Pisciotta Aileen mailto elleyDryecom Sent Tuesday October PM To Petrochko Mona L Cc Leibman Lara Subject Powell Doctrine Read This One Mona Sorry I sent the wrong clipping the first time Heres the relevant excerpt Aileen POWELL OUTLINES POINT AGENDA FOR COMMISSION FCC Chairman Michael K Powell today said he would apply his deregulatory marketbased philosophy to address a host of issues the most important of which will be spurring deployment of broadband services The widespread deployment of broadband infrastructure has probably become the central communications policy objective today he said at a press briefing in Washington He stressed the importance of the FCC taking actions to spur the digital broadband migration That could be an arduous process he said but is essential to survival He outlined five areas that he said would drive the FCCs agenda for the next several years broadband deployment competition policy spec trum allocation policy a reexamination of the foundation of media regulations and homeland security measures Shortly after he took over as chairman Mr Powell said he didnt have a list of specific regulatory objectives that he planned to pursue But today he sounded a different note It really stresses me that we dont have a more coherent cognizant vision of what were doing here he said Were just running around reacting to the latest issues The initial work to act on his agenda will be started within six months and will be substantially underway within a year he said Various proceedings will be used to address his agenda he said What were going to try to do is create clearly identifiable vehicles where key policy issues will be debated Otherwise he said the agency gets machinegunned with petitions and other filings from companies trade groups and other interested parties trying to get action on particular issues Regarding broadband services Mr Powell stressed the importance of limiting regulations that inhibit deployment It is clear that substantial investment is required to build out the new networks and we should limit regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty he said Our focus should be on demonstrable and competitive risks and discriminatory provisioning As it mulls broadband regulations the FCC plans to continue studying the market and working with states he said The agency will clarify regulatory classification and access obligations expeditiously he said He cited three proceedings that would focus on broadband services the ongoing new networks pro ceeding the cable openaccess proceeding and the third generation G wireless spectrum allocation proceeding Regarding competition Mr Powell said the Commission needed to make prudent course corrections in our policies to spur competition Facilitiesbased competition is the ultimate objective he said He stressed the need for simplified enforceable connection rules More specifically the chairman said the Commission would conclude outstanding phase I pricing flexibility proceedings and initiate a set of new proceedings over the next six months that will pro vide vehicles for rethinking our current framework He said a triennial review would provide the principle docket for evaluating unbundled network elements policy The Commission will initiate a proceeding focusing on performance measurement and enforcement in an attempt to streamline the essential performance measures used for making judgments about compliance with the local competition provision he added He also said the agency would initiate a dominance and non dominance proceeding to ask how do we develop a framework that might be used to deregulate on a carrierspecific or service specific basis depending on the level of competition and market power On spectrum allocation Mr Powell found plenty of fault with the way the government doles out valuable frequencies The nations approach to spectrum allocation is seriously fractured he said adding it was a politicized reactive process He called for a more comprehensive marketdriven policy that would allow spectrum users to decide the best uses of bands The chairman said the Commission should encourage the development of secondary spectrum markets improve interference protection standards back the development of unlicensed frequencies map out the uses and users of all spectrum promote spectral efficiency and protect frequencies used for public safety Paul Kirby Aileen A Pisciotta Kelley Drye
