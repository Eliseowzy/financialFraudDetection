the exploitation of an unfortunate incident by two Austin promoters who are also Democrat activist The conduct of the teenage twi ns is indefensible Chuys conduct is outrageous The girls made a silly mistake Chuys made a calculated grab for commercia l promotion at best and engaged in despicable dirty political activity at worstChuys smug press release confirms either or both conclusions The twins will pay a price for their conduct I hope every parent conserva tive and other decent Texans that abhors shameless exploitation of the und erage girls will ensure that Chuys pays a price for their conduct I will not set foot in Chuys and ask that everyone with a sense of decency join in expressing their outrage at Chuys despicable conduct In Texas we have the choice of an abundance of TexMex in less hostile environments Jack Rains Houston PS I urge you to share your thoughts on this subject with your friends an d family HoustonChroniclecom HoustonChroniclecom logo HoustonChroniclecom

ndly format June AM The on Chuys decision to call By JOHN WILLIAMS Copyright Houston Chronicle The first call f rom Chuys restaurant at pm Tuesday went to the dispatcher in A ustin The emergency Two underage women wanted alcoholic beverages One had an ID of another person old enough to drink It may be the first ti me a restaurant has considered underage drinking worthy of an emergency cal l in the home of the states biggest university said Becky Stewart emerge ncy services director for the Capital Area Planning Council CAPCO manages Austins regional system But the two in question had familiar names They were Jenna and Barbara Bush the presidents yearold twin daughte rs Perhaps the call is understandable No bigdollar restaurant wants to risk its liquor license by serving alcohol to someone under Tip for newsmen questionable The second call from Chuys management however is h arder to defend Chuys tipped the Austin AmericanStatesman to the scoop about the presidents partying scofflaws Amid deadline pressure and ethica l questions the newspaper didnt print a report until Thursday By then the Bush family affair rightly or wrongly was everybodys business It w ent international Chuys was mentioned in newspapers worldwide That ca nt be bad for business mused an Austin political consultant and frequent Chuys diner The success story of the restaurant chain may shed a littl e more light Chuys was started by Michael Young and John Zapp in a city that loves its Mexican food Young has been the main mover and shaker hel ping expand the restaurant chain to Houston Dallas Arlington and San Anto nio and starting other profitable businesses Described by one friend as having a Willie Nelson grin Young is a laidback Austin denizen and minor Democratic player in Travis County politics Young has strong opinions a nd occasionally attends party fundraisers though acquaintances said he ha s not taken frontline positions on any major issues He has an amazing a bility to get attention for his restaurant When Kenneth Starr was invest igating the Bill ClintonMonica Lewinsky affair Chuys sold more than Tshirts with a cartoon of Clinton shaking his finger and saying I did not have TexMex with that woman Young also appeared for free in a Sout hwest Airlines commercial with the airlines legendary boss Herb Kelleher Young got the gig which garnered free publicity for his restaurants thro ugh adman Roy Spence a friend and business partner who runs in Democratic circles Last year Spence and Young joined others to create Glazing Sadd les Ltd which owns the Krispy Kreme doughnut shops in Austin and San Anto nio I like Michael because he has built a culture where his people do t he right thing they are a big family Spence said His people serve the customers right they prepare the food right they take care of business ri ght Twins actions hard to explain Was it right to dial Many eate ries might have refused to serve the Bush daughters and left it at that The twins behavior is likewise hard to defend or explain The incident cam e two weeks after Jenna Bush made national headlines when she pleaded no co ntest to an earlier underage drinking charge Did they believe no one in Au stin would recognize them or notice the Secret Service agents nearby Th e White House has described the incidents as private family matters If the twins mother first lady Laura Bush and grandmother former first lady B arbara Bush decide to apply a dose of oldfashioned tough love it couldn t be any more painful than Thursdays frontpage headline in the New York P ost Jenna and Tonic Bush daughter in new booze incident as twin sister w atched For Chuys its a different matter Perhaps the restaurant mana gement with its Democratic ties is privately reveling in the Republican f irst familys public embarrassment The restaurant did not return calls a bout its decision to publicize the incident But Thursday afternoon the restaurant released a statement or more precisely an understatement W e sincerely regret any inconvenience this has caused the first family John Williams email address is Return to top Click on banner for more information
