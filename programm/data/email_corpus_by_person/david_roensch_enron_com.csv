expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them Anne Minard can be reached at or

south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them Anne Minard can be reached at or

ut with regards to the GEs versus the electrics on San Juan in conjunction with Sun Devil Im afraid Ive done a poor job at explaining my reasonin g so I put it on paper as best I could I hope this helps clear the issue up or at least provides enough information to allow you all to understand the concept thanks As usual this is pretty far fetched Forwarded by David RoenschETSEnron on PM David Roensch PM ToNorm SpaldingENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc SubjectFW TW Waste Heat Recovery Projects Sorry to be late with a response back but I wanted to run a few things dow n before getting back with you and explaining why I was really so intereste d in this project After visiting with you in the field this week you aske d that I jot some of this down so this will be an attempt at my reasoning a nd why I have such a sense of urgency about tieing this potential project into a Sun Devil deal Here goes nothing As I understand it the current senario for Sun Devil as it relates to the San Juan section of this project includes The addition of hp at Bloomfield A compressor restage at Bisti A new hp station at Standing Rock A larger compressor at Gallup Potentially a larger motor at Gallup A suggested change to this plan was to look at the hp GEs at Bloomf ield and Standing Rock allowing us to standdown the Electrics on the San J uan Lateral The capital cost would increase by approximately M but th e capacity increase on the lateral would be around mmcfd These are no t by any means firm numbers The problem with the suggestion obviously is the term of the contracts with ECS on the Electric drives So this is what I was thinking I know we d ont want to leave ECS holding the bag or stranding cost so if the HRSG we re to move forward at Station maybe we could allow them to wheel the com modity the fuel gas out there We provide them with gas in trade for ele ctricity currently If we stand down the electrics ECS would save dollars paid now to the utilities but they would loose large bucks from the sale of natural gas that we provide them for the power So we could allow them to keep the gas for the remaining term of the contracts and sell it to Gad ds group on the HRSG project Depending on the current margins they may be able to help Gadds group cut some expenses as well and keep this proje ct rolling Motive is to get this HRSG going so Operations can generat e some operating revenue off of this facility See the example below to f ollow along with this idea ECS currently pays approximately annually in electricity to prov ide TW shaft horse power TW provides ECS with a commodity valued at annually At per thousand The difference is TW pays ECS a demand charge of between Bisti and Bloomfield The would be an expense ECS would no longer be required to have if the Electrics were shut down So ECS should be able to allow TW out of the in annual demand charges for Bloomfield and Bisti and return the M in commodity value to TW Now there is still the issue of the in commodity value minus the returned to TW We can ke ep ECS whole on this value by transfering the fuel sale to the HRSG at Station allowing them to simply sell the fuel there or market it accordingly for the term of the current contract As long as we keep ECS whole on the value of this deal in turn ECS should be able to negotiate a deal at reduced rates to allow the HRSG project economics to become more ap pealing At least that was my idea Pretty crazy huh None the less for an increase of mmcfd on Sun Devil the potential reven ue from an operating agreement on the HRSG through EAMR and the reduced ex posure due to down time associated with the electric failures as compared t o what GE is required to provide I thought it was worth a shot If you think this is too far fetchedjust say so Norm Not carrying anyth ing on my shoulder here Have a good day and sorry this dang note was so l ong Oh yea I would have thrown Gallups numbers into this mix as well but thos e agreements are so complicated I have a hard time understanding andor rel aying information about them However understand when I say stand the electrics down on the San Juan lateral that includes Bloomfield Bisti an d Gallup R Matthews ran the modeling info and that is who I have bee n chatting with about this thought Like in school I thought I would show you my work Bisit currently has a conversion factor of that multiplys into horse power to determine how much fuel gas we owe them for shaft power They als o have a contract with PNM that determines the rate ECS pays per Mega Watt for the power they provide TW I will use for the price of gas in examples ECS pays approximately per meg for power at Bisti hp x x D per hour x D per kw x x x D annually in fuel provided to E CS x x D per hour in electric cost x D annually in electric cost Bloomfield currently has a conversion factor of Power rate I think is more in the range of dollars a meg hp x x D per hour x D per kw x x x D annually in fuel provided to ECS x x D per hour in electric cost x D annually in electric cost Ok enough of all that The bottom line expenses are as follows Bisti fuel commodity cost Bisti electricity cost Bisti demand fee paid to

Projects Norm Weve been trying to develop a project at Station due to its close proxim ity to the Round Valley substation Although weve considered several desi gns ranging from a MW steam cycle to a MW plant with an LM the req uired power price is always about MWh which is out of the market Our current objective is to find a counterparty who is willing to build a pla nt and purchase waste heat land water shared facilities and operating s ervices from TW A few parties are interested and were pressing on I would be happy to meet with you and your team to share ideas and answer q uestions John

happenings Southern Trails disappointing CPUC decision and the KMI Sonoran pipeline to California but I thought these two articles were timely Since it sounds like the Southern Trails gas is getting stranded wouldnt it be great if we could give KMI some competion for the new Power Plant being proposed in the four corners area Southern Trails might be willing to offload some of the system cheap following the outcome of the CPUC decision You may or may not be aware but TW was working with D Hawkins at providing operating services of this Souther Trails system for Questar so we have pretty good info on the Questar system or Don does I would guess Anyhow I know the Southern Trails system has to be in close proximity to this proposed power plant If I am driving you nuts with this junk mail Kim please let me know Southern Trails Disappointed by CPUC Decision Decision Discourages Development of New Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity SALT LAKE CITY Aug PRNewswire Officials from Questar Southern Trails Pipeline Co today expressed disappointment with the California Public Utility Commissions CPUC Aug ruling on Southern California Gas Companys SoCal Gas Residual Load Service RLS tariff The CPUCs proposed new peaking rate while an improvement over SoCals current RLS tariff still does not level the playing field said DN Rose Southern Trails president and CEO It punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCal competitor and it will discourage the development of new pipelines inside California Under the CPUCs proposed new peaking rate new gasfired power plants wanting natural gas service from both SoCal Gas and a new competing pipeline will pay a higher rate for SoCals service than captive customers taking service entirely from SoCal In addition new power plants would be subject to more restrictive balancing services than captive customers and would pay even more for interruptible service than California power plants in other parts of the state Rose noted the previous RLS tariff was so punitive that not a single customer has taken service from a competing pipeline since the RLS was enacted in The new SoCal peaking rate while not as onerous as the RLS tariff will likely preserve SoCals monopoly in Southern California The CPUCs peaking rate is anticompetitive Rose said Neither PGE Pacific Gas Electric nor any interstate pipeline enjoys such protection from competition Questar is seeking entry into the California market with its Southern Trails Pipeline project which could deliver million cubic feet of natural gas daily to Southern California Questar purchased the former crudeoil pipeline in November The existing inchdiameter pipeline runs about miles from New Mexico through Arizona and into California traveling through San Bernardino Riverside Orange and Los Angeles counties to Long Beach The project received both federal and state certification last year and has completed extensive environmental reviews The eastern zone of the Southern Trails Pipeline which extends from the Four Corners area to the California state line is fully contracted Questar expects to have it in service by mid Rose indicated that the future of the California section of Southern Trails is uncertain While not abandoning efforts to put the pipeline into natural gas service the company will be forced by the unfavorable CPUC decision to consider alternative uses for the California portion including possible conversion to transport crude oil or other liquid petroleum products Questar Southern Trails is a subsidiary of Questar Corp NYSE A HREF a billion diversified natural gas company headquartered in Salt Lake City Through subsidiaries Questar transports natural gas through a mile system in Utah Colorado New Mexico and Wyoming The company also serves as the primary natural gas distributor in Utah offering services similar to those offered by SoCal Gas and PGE in California Regent Energy Corporation and Millennium Energy Ventures Sign Power Generation Accord for MW Plant Estimated at Million Capital Cost HOUSTON Aug PRNewswire Regent Energy Corporation OTC Bulletin Board RGEY Regent today executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures MEVCO a private Houstonbased venture capital and project development company wwwmevcocom to develop an electric plant with MW generating capacity estimated cost million on Regents Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County New Mexico Ownership of the project is Regent and MEVCO Under the agreement MEVCO will manage the permitting estimated at to months and construction process arranging the equity as needed for same Regent will be prepared to give up total of its net for the financing netting a interest following the equitydebt financing Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico totaling an estimated Bcf and MMcfpd current production This production will be sufficient to power MW of the power plant with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers Phillip Gennarelli Managing Director of MEVCO said We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent coupled with Regents Horseshoe Gallup holdings which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies John Ehrman President of Regent commented The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing currently producing some million per month in net operating income coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets It is a good use of our surface lease not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regents core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington New Mexico Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration Recently Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field a transaction expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter giving Regent ownership of the current minerals on the lease For more information call Phillip Gennarelli at or
