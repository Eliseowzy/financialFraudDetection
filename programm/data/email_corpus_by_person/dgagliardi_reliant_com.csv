Austin Texas Phone Top UT Basketball Assistant Gets Head Job at Siena Rob Lanier the Longhorns top assistant basketball coach and lead recruiter for the last two years was named head coach at Siena College in Loudonville NY Wednesday UT head coach Rick Barnes was out of town on a recruiting trip but he issue d a statement praising Lanier and saying he is as qualified to be a head coach as any assistant coach he has known Barnes gave no indication when he will name a new assistant Six of his former assistants have become college head coaches and that is because he always hires a bright young assistant on the way up who also happens to be an outstanding recruiter He only has them for a year or two but they are very productive during that time and then he goes out and finds another bright young one to take the departed guys place Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns including most of last years top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T J Ford QUAN COSBY UPDATE I talked to Albert Satchell tonight He is the guardian o f heralded UT recruit Quan Cosby He told me that Quan Cosby told a TV reporte r he probably would give up football if he is one of the first players chosen in the major league draft Some callers have told me today that the T V reporter quoted Cosby as saying he would choose baseball if he is drafted in the first rounds I didnt hear the TV report but there is a big difference in being one of the first players drafted and being drafted in the first rounds With major league teams players will be chosen in the first rounds Anyway after talking to Satchell my blood pressure has returned to normal because Cosby while he is a great athlete and undoubtedly is an outstanding baseball player will not be one of the first players drafted He probably will be one of the first The biggest difference in being one of the first guys drafted and being the th guy drafted is about million or million Ive had some calls today saying there are reports on some internet sites that redshirt freshman LB Rashad Thomas has left the team He was out workin g out with the rest of them voluntarily of course yesterday so unless he quit today hes still a Longhorn FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES LTydrick Riley of Crockett is one of the states top junior recruits he plays QB at Crockett but projects as a WR in college Hes big fast athletic and hes an Aggie lean primarily because his uncle Claude Riley also from Crockett played basketball at AM probably about years ago But young Riley says he plans to attend camps a t UT and AM this summer With our facilities and coaching staff and city compared to the Aggies facilities and coaching staff and city I like our chances Texas probably will award about to scholarships in February and as many as six or seven of them could be filled by defensive linemen After years of skimpy crops of defensive linemen there are a lot o f top juniors around and many of them really like the Longhorns DTs Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo are sons of former Longhorn stars DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel is the brother of Cole Pittman the popular young Longhorn DT who wa s killed in a traffic accident about six weeks ago in a tragedy that shook th e UT campus I like our chances will all three of these fine outofstate prospects The Longhorns also are in strong contention for two top DTs in Texas Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Earl Anderson of San Marcos an d also for two top DEs Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Larry Dibbles of Lancaster They also are in the race for several other top prospects in the defensive line so signs point to UT having a great class of defensive linemen to go along with the great class of offensive linemen who are coming in as freshman this year The Longhorns first summer camp will begin on June which is just a little more than six weeks away Thats when coach Mack Brown and his assistants usually start raking in top commitments and they are poised to do it again because many of the top players like Texas enough to at least consider committing early Just remember Jonathan Scott did it in early June last year TRACK RECRUITING NOTE Sage Thames of Wolfforth Frenship the nations top high school pole vaulter has signed with Texas Thames already a twoteam state Class A

and as many as six or seven of them could be filled by defensive linemen After years of skimpy crops of defensive linemen there are a lot o f top juniors around and many of them really like the Longhorns DTs Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo are sons of former Longhorn stars DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel is the brother of Cole Pittman the popular young Longhorn DT who wa s killed in a traffic accident about six weeks ago in a tragedy that shook th e UT campus I like our chances will all three of these fine outofstate prospects The Longhorns also are in strong contention for two top DTs in Texas Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Earl Anderson of San Marcos an d also for two top DEs Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Larry Dibbles of Lancaster They also are in the race for several other top prospects in the defensive line so signs point to UT having a great class of defensive linemen to go along with the great class of offensive linemen who are coming in as freshman this year The Longhorns first summer camp will begin on June which is just a little more than six weeks away Thats when coach Mack Brown and his assistants usually start raking in top commitments and they are poised to do it again because many of the top players like Texas enough to at least consider committing early Just remember Jonathan

P O Box Austin Texas Phone UT Recruits Look Good in NorthSouth Game The Longhorns had eight recruits in the annual NorthSouth game in Fort Worth Tuesday night and they all looked good at times One of the UT recruits DB Huston Street of Austin Westlake is coming to Texas to play baseball instead of football But the seven future Longhorn football players headed by QB Kendal Briles of Wolfforth Frenship who will be a DB at Texas S Rufus Harris of La Porte and OG Mike Garcia were among the stars in the game which resulted in a victory for the North The game was a total defensive struggle until halfway through the fourth quarter The South was leading at that point But Briles scrambled yards to make a key first down then hit a yard touchdown pass to put the North on top The South came back with another field goal to tie it but the North got a long touchdown pass in the final seconds to win Harris was one of the games big hitters in the secondary for the South He made a thunderous hit early in the game Garcia also did a good job of blocking for the South OT William Winston of Houston Madison teamed with Garcia to provide good pass and run blocking for the South Future Longhorns joining Briles on the victorious North squad were OT Will Allen of Cypress Falls WRCB Aaron Ross of Tyler hell be a CB at Texas and speedy DB Michael Huff of Irving Nimitz The teams were sloppy at times because they had less than a week of practice and that always makes for mistakes penalties and inconsistent play But all of the future Longhorns produced some highlights along the way Texas had more signees in the game than any other school Super RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee also was invited but passed it up to continue working out in Austin to be ready to challenge for playing time at UT as a true freshman The Aggies had six including pound DE Brandon Johnson of Bryan who was the Defensive Player of the Game Johnson showed great passrushing skills for the North Junior DE O J McClintock says the doctors have told him he can resume working out in about three weeks and probably will miss only one or two games after cutting some tendons and muscles in his right arm when he rammed his arm through a window when he tried to catch a relative who was falling RECRUITING NOTES That October showdown in Dallas between Texas and Oklahoma probably will decide the Big South championship and it also will have a lot to do with where some of the top players in Texas wind up playing their college football Four of the top players on my man differencemaker list like the Longhorns but they also have developed some affection for the Sooners lately and say they probably will watch the two teams this season before making a decision They four are the states top player DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings who says Texas is No but the Sooners are a close No the No guy DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster who likes UT OU and Notre Dame but says he probably will stay close to home and pick either the Horns or the Sooners the No player LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar who almost committed to Texas on an unofficial visit almost committed to OU on an unofficial visit there and now says hes going to wait until after the season to make a selection and OL Justin Blalock of Plano East the states top OL and No on the overall list says he is still looking at a lot of schools but likes the Longhorns because they are the state school and also likes the Sooners because they are the national champions He says he wants to see how the teams play this year before making a decision DT Marco Martin of Mesquite says UT is his leader right now and so does LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite Both are top national recruits On my list of the top players Texas already has commitments from No DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos No LB Brian Robison of Splensora and No OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood I think the Horns have at least a shot at other players on the list No Wright No QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison No DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands No RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park No Dibbles No Harris No Smith No Blalock No Martin No CB Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln No WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus No DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac and No Athlete DaBryan Blanton of Forney They also have good shots at a couple of others if their grade situations improve

Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Chase Pittman Commits to Longhorns UT Has Pledges The Longhorns picked up their second top national recruit in less than week Sunday when DE Chase Pittman of national powerhouse Shreveport Evangel committed to Texas during ceremonies at his church Pittman chose Texas over LSU at the end but he was recruited by top schools from all over the country He is the brother of Cole Pittman the sophomore Longhorn DT who was killed in a vehicle accident in February while returning to Texas for spring football practice I went to Lufkin Friday night to watch Evangel play Lufkin one of the top teams in Texas In last weeks USA Today rankings Lufkin led by QB Reggie McNeal an AM pledge was rated No in the country and Evangel led by sophomore QB John David Booty and Pittman was rated No That rating will change this week because Evangel defeated Lufkin primarily because of Bootys throwing and a stout defense led by Pittman Lufkin ran away from Pittmans right DE spot all night but he still had by my count a sack three QB pressures and eight tackles McNeal is a sprinter but Pittman twice came from the far side to run him out of bounds He has outstanding speed and quickness and is on many national top teams The other national top pledge the Horns got recently was from LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar who first committed to Oklahoma last Monday then switched to Texas on Wednesday and said he is solid for the Longhorns With a plus SAT he said UTs academic superiority over OU was a big factor The other recruits who have committed to UT are DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona and Tully

Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley Eight of the players Pittman Smith Davis Anderson Sendlein Valdez Tweedie and Thomas have been on one or more national top lists Davis was on all the lists last year The Longhorns probably will take about to players this year The limit is in one year but Pittman will graduate in December and enroll in January which means he can be counted against last years class Davis also has a chance to graduate in December and enroll in January If he does he also count count against last year The Longhorns are also on the short list of another outstanding DE who will graduate in December He is Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Oklahoma If you are wondering who the remaining to signees will be most or all

Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Brown Says Benson Might Start Saturday at Oklahoma State Coach Mack Brown said Thursday freshman RB Cedric Benson has had a good week of practice and well make a decision at gametime on whether he or Ivan Williams will start Benson has run with the first team in practice all week after making only a cameo appearance in the loss to Oklahoma Saturday and Brown said the coaches plan to use him more for the rest of the season Benson has great acceleration through the line of scrimmage and the Longhorn offensive linemen can usually open a hole briefly against a good defense He has a much better chance of getting through a small hole than the pound Williams who requires a step or two to get much acceleration Brown also said DE Kaelen Thornton sprained knee and TB Victor Ike bruised ribs have not been able to practice this week and wont make the trip to Stillwater this weekend He said DT Maurice Gordon a former DE will move back to end at start in Thorntons place and he said sophomore DT Adam Doiron will start at tackle when Texas is in its base defense The Longhorns might return to a at times against Oklahoma State Saturday and they probably will use it a lot next week when a powerrunning Colorado team comes to Austin but they have used a most of the time in their last two games against pass oriented Oklahoma and Texas Tech Brown said earlier in the week that several starters on offense were in danger of losing their jobs but he softened that statement a little Thursday saying We may rotate three guards and Derrick Dockery might play a little more at tackle and Jason Glynn might play a little more What that means is a probable threeway rotation at guard between Dockery Antwan KirkHughes and Tillmon Holloway with Dockery sliding out to tackle to replace Robbie Doane at times and a twoway rotation at center with Matt Anderson and Glynn splitting time Brown also said the team has been practicing hard this week and trying to put the tough loss to Oklahoma behind them The fans dont have to get ready until Saturday he said but the coaches and players have to start getting ready on Monday Brown also was asked about a story in Thursdays Fort Worth Star Telegram alleging he telephoned the prosecutor in a sexual misconduct suit against former Shreveport Evangel head coach Dennis Dunn and offered to be a character witness for Dunn A minor girl in Marshall has accused Dunn of improper sexual conduct Brown said he would have only one comment on that and that comment was I would be happy to be a character witness for Dennis Dunn who has been a friend of mind for more than years RECRUITING NOTES Add another big fast linebacker to the list of players Texas has offered a scholarship He is Michael Williams of Lindale who is so fast he plays wide receiver on offense Williams who already has a qualifying test score told me he has offers from Texas Oklahoma Texas AM Baylor Minnesota and

Brownwood Lineman Becomes First Longhorn Pledge for New Class The Longhorns after wrapping up a top five national recruiting class last month got started on another bumper crop Tuesday when outstanding Brownwood junior OL Bret Valdez confirmed he has committed to the UT coaches Valdez one of the states great run blockers said he went to the UT spring game March and really liked what he saw He said the Texas coaches offere d him a scholarship at the spring game They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year he said I competed in the Texas Relays he throws the shot and discus las t weekend and after I was through competing I went over to the coaches offices and talked to coach Mack Brown and coaches Tim Nunez and Mike Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit He said he also was being recruited by about other schools including Florida State Texas AM Oklahoma Alabama and Notre Dame The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State AM OU Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to come down and see m e then But he said he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him that he is not interested Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two he said I like the way they emphasize academics too He plays tackle in Brownwoods option offense but said he probably will be tried at guard at Texas I think Ill have a good chance to start after a redshirt year he said The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next February and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other to offensive line prospects I have been talking to so they must consider Valde z to be the states top OL prospect Brownwood went last year and Valdez was the teams top run blocker He has thrown the shot feet and discus On tape Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start that allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have seen this year One of the best things about him is that he is only and wont turn until June but he already benches and squats RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns start their summer camps in just seven weeks and they probably will pick up several more commitments at that time Other top prospects who list the Longhorns No right now are RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park QB Vincent Young and CB Donald Burgs of

O Box Austin Texas Phone Brown Says Buffs Pose Real Problem No TV for Game at Missouri Coach Mack Brown said Monday Colorado will be the best running team Texas will see this year and he also said the Buffaloes have the best offensive line the Horns will face The two teams play at pm Saturday in a game that will be televised regionally by ABC The Longhorns are a point favorite over the Buffaloes also Brown said DE Kalen Thornton who missed the Oklahoma State game with a sprained knee is expected to return to practice Tuesday and he said that is very good news because Colorado has such a powerful running game that the Longhorns will need every available defensive lineman to try to stop it This is the best running team we have seen since the last time we played Nebraska he said They have a big physical line and some big physical backs He said Oklahoma uses its passing game to set up its running game He said Colorado is the opposite They run to set up their playaction passes he said They have a very good offense and their quarterback Craig Ochs is a good passer and he can hurt you running Well have a battle The Longhorns probably will be back in their basic defense against the runoriented Buffs and Brown said sophomore DT Adam Doiron who started against Oklahoma State played really well and will start again Fellow sophomore Marcus Tubbs is a fixture at the other tackle spot If Thornton is able to return Brown said that will give the coaches freedom to use Maurice Gordon at end or tackle Gordon a former end was a starting tackle until Thornton got hurt and then he moved back to end He said the Longhorns have to work hard to run a lot against Colorados tough run defense because they like to dominate time of possession with their running game and just wear the other team down We try to wear the other team down too so thats going to be interesting The Longhorns have won straight games at home That is the longest home winning streak since the early s They also are at home since Brown took over Brown said true freshman RB Cedric Benson will start and Ivan Williams also will play quite a bit against Colorado Cedric did a good job Brown said and Ivan did well when he came in late We want Cedric to get a lot of carries but probably not like he got against Oklahoma State Well probably spread it out a little more He also said TE Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards are going to start getting more chances to catch passes They can really run and weve got to work them into the offense a little more and give them more chances he said The Longhorns game at Missouri on October was not chosen for TV but UT officials have asked the Missouri athletic director to approve a pay TV arrangement for some Texas cities The game time would have to be pm or later to be approved for pay TV because the Big has a rule that pro hibits any league game telecast conflicting with the sanctioned telecast which begins at am UT officials expect to get an answer from Missouri officials Tuesday This will be the first Longhorn game this season that was not chosen for TV and it is the longest road trip this season Ironically the two longest Big trips last year to Colorado and Kansas were not chosen for TV either So much for all that famed UT clout with the TV networks RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are still at commitments One of them is a little shaky LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar says he plans to sign with Texas but might take a couple of visits When kids take visits the commitments are shaky Well have to see what develops in regard to Smith

O Box Austin Texas Phone Horns Favored by at Missouri Baylor Game Set for TV The Longhorns are favored by points for their pm game Saturday at Missouri There will be no TV for the game contrary to earlier announcements Isnt it ironic that the longest road trip of the year will be the Longhorns first game this year to fail to be televised So much for Texas legendary clout with the TV networks But the road game at Baylor the following week has been set for an pm kickoff and will be televised by Fox Syndication Check your local listings to see who will televise the game A kickoff time for Texas final home game with Kansas on Saturday November has yet to be set The Longhorns season finale at Texas AM on Friday November will kick off at am and be broadcast nationally on ABC sports Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorn players and coaches have taken note of the rash of upsets around the country and are determined to take care of their business He also said this Longhorn team has been as good as the teams we had at North Carolina but the question is how they finish We finished strong at North Carolina He said he has told the Longhorn players they have the ability to win the rest of their games if they show up and play hard every week The first Bowl Championship Series BCS standings were announced Monday and Texas was ranked No behind five teams with perfect records The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score Oklahoma came in at No in the first standings at followed by Nebraska at UCLA at Miami at Virginia Tech at Texas at Michigan at Maryland at Tennessee at and Washington State at to round out the top One of the top two will drop this week because OU and Nebraska meet in Lincoln Miami and Virginia Tech also clash in the final weeki of the regular season so at least two of the teams above Texas are certain to lose Under the BCS formula the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls which are the Rose Orange Fiesta and Sugar The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year If Texas wins out the Longhorns probably will wind up in New Orleans in the Sugar Bowl Coach Brown said This is the time of year when polls finally begin to matter and we are really excited to be in the mix for national honors This team has earned that respect and with all the football left to play who knows what will happen What we have to do is to keep improving and concetnrate on the next game he said You cant win the the rest unless you win the next one And if we win the rest we have a chance for some very good things to happen But we have to beat Missouri Saturday on the road and thats the only thing we can control this week RECRUITING NOTES WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida Monday and LB Michael Williams of Lindale said he is committed to Oklahoma but wants to visit Texas and Minnesota and possibly Texas Tech to be sure Texas had offered Williams and the Longhorns are continuing to try to recruit him The Horns had not offered Timmons because of some offfield problems he has had but they were considering offering him at the end of the season and still might do so if he appears interested The Longhorns still have commitments but one of them LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is in the same shape as Michael Williams He says he is committed to Texas but wants to take some visits to be be sure BASKETBALL RECRUITING Brad Buckman the power forward at Austin Westlake who is a national top recruit told me tonight all the reports that he has already decided to attend North Carolina just arent true Im trying to decide between Texas and North Carolina and its right down the middle right now He said he hopes to make a decision by Wednesday BASEBALL RECRUITING The Longhorn baseball team got a commitment today from Scott Kazmir of Houston Cypress Falls Kazmir is the nations top pitching prospect Hes a lefthander with a mph fastball and good control Thats the good news The bad news is that the pros will throw so much money at him that there is very little chance he will ever throw a pitch for the Longhorns My next

P O Box Austin Texas Phone Buckman Picks Horns over Heels Browns Says UT Has Game Season Brad Buckman a pound power forward from Austin Westlake who is a national top recruit picked Texas over North Carolina Tuesday saying the Longhorn basketball program is on the upswing and he wants to be a part of it He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC where basketball reigns supreme was very strong but he told me today Ive always wanted to go to Texas This is where my heart is His father Brent played on two national championship golf teams at UT and his mother Tammy also is a Texas graduate But he said he also used his head in picking the Horns over the Tar Heels After looking at it closely he said I think Texas basketball is really on the upswing Theyve signed two McDonalds All Americans freshman point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville in the last two years They could make it three in three years because Buckmans stock soared this summer when he played in several top AAU tournaments and more than held his own against some of the nations heralded big guys Dave Telep a national recruiting analyst said he probably is one of the nations top recruits The reality is that while there are guys with larger names there probably arent better players in the class Telep said He is athletic can handle it some he blocks shots he shoots to mediumrange and he scores in the post Clifton McNeely his coach at Westlake also says he also works very hard to get better Hes a very gifted player with a lot of talent to start with McNeely said but the best thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic I dont think you could find anyone who works harder than he does McNeely also said he thinks Buckman is the best player in Texas There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally but Buckman is a national top recruit who is the kind of bluecollar inside player UT coach Rick Barnes loves to coach Buckman averaged points rebounds and blocks for Westlake as a junior and was recruited by other top basketball programs across the country including Missouri UCLA Kentucky and others He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period in November Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players most of them in other states and hope to sign a sharp shooting guard and a wing Coach Mack Brown said Tuesday he and his assistant coaches have told the Longhorn players they start a fourgame season this Saturday at Missouri He said the Longhorns at and with a No ranking in the BCS have a chance to rise if they keep winning because a lot of the teams above them play each other or play other unbeaten teams Oklahoma is No in the BCS rankings and Nebraska is No They play Saturday in Lincoln so one of them is destined to drop UCLA is No in the BCS but has to play at undefeated Washington State later this season and Miami and Virginia Tech are No and but they play in the final regularseason game for both teams For those of you who still want to think about a national title this season it is a long long shot First OU would have to lose to Nebraska and either Texas Tech or Texas AM and then Texas would have to beat Nebraska in the Big title game Then all but one of the major unbeaten teams would have to lose a game so it wound up like last year when OU was the only unbeaten team and played oncebeaten Florida State for the national title It could happen but dont bet on it I think the Horns have a great chance to finish but I doubt that all but one of the unbeaten teams will lose INJURY NOTE It looks like LB Lee Jackson and DE O J McClintock both fourthyear seniors will redshirt and return next year Both have been out with injuries all season and Brown said Tuesday there are no plans to play them He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg He said McClintock could have played Saturday but were not going to play him unless we need him RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are still recruiting WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus who committed to Florida Monday and LB Michael Williams of Lindale who ways he is a soft

Austin Texas Phone Top UT Basketball Assistant Gets Head Job at Siena Rob Lanier the Longhorns top assistant basketball coach and lead recruiter for the last two years was named head coach at Siena College in Loudonville NY Wednesday UT head coach Rick Barnes was out of town on a recruiting trip but he issue d a statement praising Lanier and saying he is as qualified to be a head coach as any assistant coach he has known Barnes gave no indication when he will name a new assistant Six of his former assistants have become college head coaches and that is because he always hires a bright young assistant on the way up who also happens to be an outstanding recruiter He only has them for a year or two but they are very productive during that time and then he goes out and finds another bright young one to take the departed guys place Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns including most of last years top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T J Ford QUAN COSBY UPDATE I talked to Albert Satchell tonight He is the guardian o f heralded UT recruit Quan Cosby He told me that Quan Cosby told a TV reporte r he probably would give up football if he is one of the first players chosen in the major league draft Some callers have told me today that the T V reporter quoted Cosby as saying he would choose baseball if he is drafted in the first rounds I didnt hear the TV report but there is a big difference in being one of the first players drafted and being drafted in the first rounds With major league teams players will be chosen in the first rounds Anyway after talking to Satchell my blood pressure has returned to normal because Cosby while he is a great athlete and undoubtedly is an outstanding baseball player will not be one of the first players drafted He probably will be one of the first The biggest difference in being one of the first guys drafted and being the th guy drafted is about million or million Ive had some calls today saying there are reports on some internet sites that redshirt freshman LB Rashad Thomas has left the team He was out workin g out with the rest of them voluntarily of course yesterday so unless he quit today hes still a Longhorn FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES LTydrick Riley of Crockett is one of the states top junior recruits he plays QB at Crockett but projects as a WR in college Hes big fast athletic and hes an Aggie lean primarily because his uncle Claude Riley also from Crockett played basketball at AM probably about years ago But young Riley says he plans to attend camps a t UT and AM this summer With our facilities and coaching staff and city compared to the Aggies facilities and coaching staff and city I like our chances Texas probably will award about to scholarships in February and as many as six or seven of them could be filled by defensive linemen After years of skimpy crops of defensive linemen there are a lot o f top juniors around and many of them really like the Longhorns DTs Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo are sons of former Longhorn stars DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel is the brother of Cole Pittman the popular young Longhorn DT who wa s killed in a traffic accident about six weeks ago in a tragedy that shook th e UT campus I like our chances will all three of these fine outofstate prospects The Longhorns also are in strong contention for two top DTs in Texas Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Earl Anderson of San Marcos an d also for two top DEs Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Larry Dibbles of Lancaster They also are in the race for several other top prospects in the defensive line so signs point to UT having a great class of defensive linemen to go along with the great class of offensive linemen who are coming in as freshman this year The Longhorns first summer camp will begin on June which is just a little more than six weeks away Thats when coach Mack Brown and his assistants usually start raking in top commitments and they are poised to do it again because many of the top players like Texas enough to at least consider committing early Just remember Jonathan

Box Austin Texas Phone Freshman CB Ross Leaves Team Plans to Return in January Longhorn freshman CB Aaron Ross of Tyler has left the Longhorn football squad to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse issues head coach Mack Brown announced Friday I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in order to rejoin the team Ross said Im going to get those issues worked out so I can return to Texas in January LB Aurmon Satchell of Denver had the same problem a year ago and he is back on the team now and contending for playing time as a freshman Hopefully Ross will work out the problems as Satchell did and return to the team If he gets the problems resolved by January he can go through spring training with the team next year Federal laws prohibit university officials discussing academic problems so no reason was given for Ross leaving the team However it probably is either an improvement in the SAT or ACT score that was disallowed as being excessive or a course that Tyler High School officials counted as a core course and the Clearinghouse folks didnt think was a core course Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said last week that Ross probably would be play in the Longhorns first game and had a good chance to be his dime back sixth defensive back in passing situations Two other true freshmen Michael Huff and Cedric Griffin will be competing for that job now The first day of classes at UT will be Wednesday and the Longhorns will open the football season on Saturday September vs New Mexico State at p m in Austin in a game that will be nationally televised by the Fox Network FOOTBALL NOTES Head Coach Mack Brown has closed all regular season practices to the press Reporters will be allowed to talk to Brown his assistants and players after practice This is a departure from last season when reporters were allowed to attend practice every Tuesday During the season the big practice days are Tuesday and Wednesday With freshman Cedric Benson looking even better than expected and sophomore Ivan Williams displaying his usual spring brilliance in the fall too the Longhorns are in much better shape at running back than any of us had a right to expect Junior Victor Ike is the starter and he looks bigger and stronger than he has been in the past but Benson and Williams will play a lot too Senior Maurice Gordon and freshman Stevie Lee had very good performances in the final scrimmage Wednesday night and they should be able to make the problems at defensive tackle go away Sophomore Marcus Tubbs is solid at one DT and Gordon Lee and sophomore Adam Doiron will all be able to help giving the team four capable tackles Look for a lot more fourwideout and twotight end formations with just one running back this season because third WR Sloan Thomas and second TE Brock Edwards are better than most teams starters The Longhorns will have the best receiving corps wide receivers and tight ends and one of the best defensive secondaries in college football They also will have a fine passblocking offensive line and a very good defensive line That means the seasons success will depend on how the offensive line blocks for the run and how well QB

Gives Up Football Quan Cosby of Mart one of the Longhorns prize recruits signed a fiveyear baseball contract with the California Angels and said his football playing days are over It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other Longhorns You just dont expect a sixthround draft choice to get enough money to give up football But Cosby told me he got close to firstround money I told them what it would take for me to give up football and thats what they came up with he said Cosby a fleet wide receiver who was expected to see action at Texas this season said baseball is easier on the body so I probably will be able to play baseball longer than I could have played football Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career doesnt work out as planned he said Thats a possibility but Im figuring on playing baseball for a long time Texas AM QB Marki Farris is an example of a player who tried pro baseball then returned to play college football after several years Cosby declined to say how much he signed for but did say it included tuition and fees to attend Texas for four years to get his degree UT head coach Mack Brown said The reason a young man comes to college is to better his life and we gave Quan an opportunity to do that If he feels it is better for him to play professional baseball then we are excited for him Were disappointed shortterm that he will not be coming to Texas this fall but if he ever decides he wants to give up baseball and come to college wed be happy to have him Cosbys decision to go the pro baseball route probably will mean the Longhorns will try to sign three wide receivers this year They had homed in on Marquis Johnson of Champaign Illinois and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest but they probably will step up their efforts on Xavier McQuire of Dallas Carter and DaBryan Blanton of Forney Blanton is a running back at Forney but his slight build and blazing speed fully automatic meters at the state meet will see him move to wide receiver or cornerback at the next level McQuire was at the Texas summer camp that ended today Wednesday and he said he had a good time but was still considering several schools DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac attended the Texas minicamp Sunday and is being recruited by the Longhorns He says his big three are Kentucky Texas and Arkansas On tape he looks like a fine outside pass rusher Like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos a Longhorn pledge he has an explosive start The Longhorns didnt appear to get any additional commitments Wednesday but that could change Thursday when all the kids get home I told you in my last emailfax about the new NCAA rule interpretation that prohibits coaches taking commitments at summer camps Texas has four early commitments In addition to Anderson they are DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona DT Sonny Davis who is attending junior college in Mississippi after graduating from Austin Lanier and OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood Marc Pittman father of Cole Pittman the UT defensive tackle who was killed in an automobile accident in February was at the Longhorn practice Wednesday with his other son DE Chase Pittman a top national recruit plus several other Shreveport Evangel stars including John David Booty a pound quarterback who might be the nations top sophomore prospect and another outstanding sophomore DE Chris Bowers He also brought two top defensive backs who are being highly recruited from Evangel They are Jonathan Wade he ran a meters in April and Chad Johnson BASEBALL NOTES James Sweeney the outstanding catcher Texas signed has inked a pro contract and Vincent Sinisi the top slugger the Horns signed a year ago has transferred to Rice after redshirting this year at Texas because of persistent problems

True Orange EMailFax AM Original Message From Sent Sunday June PM To Subject True Orange EMailFax True Orange EMailFax Service Volume FaxEMail Sunday June Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone DT Lyle Sendlein Commits to Longhorns Lyle Sendlein says he has known since he was a small child that he wanted to play football at Texas so he said a new NCAA rule interpretation that prohibits recruits committing while at a summer camp was no problem at all The minicamp was today Sunday so I just called them Saturday and committed he said When they told me about the new rule I just decided to take care of it in advance I knew I was going to play for the Longhorns so I didnt have any problem committing before I got here for the camp Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac plus Notre Dame Nebraska Michigan and Penn State Coach Mack Brown said one of the Longhorns top recruiting goals this year was to sign several top defensive linemen and while he cant comment on individual recruits Sendlein is an outstanding defensive line prospect Sendlein said he was measured at the camp and came in at a shade over and he said he weighed in at He also said he clocked a in the but it seemed like the times were all a little slow I usually run or He is quick enough that he plays middle linebacker for Scottsdale Chaparral the Arizona big school state champion two years running after going in and Sendlein brings to four the number of early commitments DT Sonny Davis who committed to Texas right out of Austin Lanier is in junior college in Mississippi and says he still plans to come to Texas when he graduates from the JC That would put him on schedule to come in with next Februarys signees OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos two of the states top prospects also have committed to Texas The Longhorns plan to sign only three offensive linemen and Valdez was the first one they offered They hope to get the other two from a threesome that includes Jeff Lebby of Andrews Tony Ugoh of Houston Westfield and Justin Blaylock of Plano East Lebby and Blaylock attended Sundays UT minicamp Anderson is No and Valdez is No on my man differencemaker list Davis was in my top five his senior year and Sendlein would be in my top this year if he played in Texas In other words this is a great quartet to start the UT recruiting bandwagon rolling DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest the top players in the state at their respective positions also attended the UT minicamp Sunday I talked to all of them tonight and they all like Texas but they also are considering several other schools and all three said they probably will not commit to anyone this summer I like the Longhorns chances with both Wrights but I think Leitko is so wide open that he could wind up at any of the five schools he is considering UT AM Stanford Michigan and Notre Dame Texas AM also had a minicamp Sunday and Aggie reporters were saying no one at the camp was likely to get an offer at this point so it would appear that the cream of the states recruiting crop showed up in Austin I know Leitko Lebby Blaylock and both Wrights had offers from Texas before they came to the camp Sunday The NCAA edict that prevents recruits from accepting scholarships while at a summer camp is strange because there are no new rules relating to camps It seems that some NCAA bureaucrat just gave a new interpretation based on a rule that that has been around for several years FOOTBALL NOTES Lindys the first reputable national college football magazine I have seen this year picks Chris Simms as the third best QB in the country and the best one in the Big If he lives up to that hype I think we can all buy our plane tickets to Pasadena With the receivers the Longhorns have in stock a great quarterback would make the Texas offense too tough to handle by anyone on the schedule To reach that level Simms will need to be much improved at looking off his receivers and much better at throwing the ball away at times instead of forcing it into double coverage Super RB

Austin Texas Phone Round Rock Westwood Wide Receiver Becomes th Commitment Wide receiver Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood said Thursday he called UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis and committed to the Longhorns He is Texas seventh early committment Miksch ran a at the Texas AM Nike camp and followed that with a at the Texas camp that ended Wednesday I won the fastest man contest at both camps he said He also ran a meters last track season Miksch the son of former Longhorn WR Donnie Miksch a letterman from Needville said Purdue Nebraska AM Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all recruiting him He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to their summer camps Ill have to call both of them and tell them I wont be coming to their camps he said He caught passes for yards and five touchdowns for the Warriors last season Houston Madisons Donald Burgs one of the states top cornerback recruits also attended the UT camp that ended Wednesday He had been a strong Texas lean earlier but he know says he is wide open and probably wont commit to anyone this summer Burgs praised Miksch when I talked to him Wednesday night When I asked him if anyone at the camp really impressed him he said There was a wide receiver from Round Rock named Dustin something who was really good He was hard to cover and he has really good speed He has good hands too The Longhorn coaches cant comment on recruits but Burgs wasnt the only one Miksch impressed because the Texas coaches usually try to sign larger wide receivers Ive been a Longhorn fan all my life Miksch said Ive always gone to the games and it gives me the chills when the players run through that smoke before the game This was an easy choice for me when Texas offered a scholarship This is where Ive always wanted to play Texas got commitments Monday from QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar and RBAthlete Clint Haney of Smithson Valley Malone and Haney both attended the UT minicamp Sunday then got offers Monday from the Longhorns due to the new NCAA rule interpretation that doesnt allow kids to commit at summer camps Normally both would have been offered by coach Mack Brown at the conclusion of their minicamp sessions The Longhorns other commitments are from DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona and DT Sonny Davis who signed with Texas last year but is having to go to a junior college in Mississippi because he failed to qualify academically Speaking of academically qualifying only two of the Longhorns February signees are still in limbo after CB Aaron Ross of Tyler qualified earlier this week The two who are still trying to make it academically are RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferson and LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison Editors Note I dont put out as much academic information as I did in earlier years because a it is not a good subject for internet bulletin boards and b it tends to irritate the high school coaches So please use this information judiciously Super RB Cedric Benson says the only way he will sign a pro baseball contract is if he gets an offer that lets him play college football like Ricky Williams did when he was at Texas The Midland Lee star has a chance to solve the Longhorns problems at running back and he says he is raring to get that chance BASKETBALL NOTES Ed Kohtala who has been an assistant to UT head baskeball coach Rick Barnes since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago has been named head coach at Alma College in Alma Michigan Barnes is expected to name a replacement in the next couple of weeks

Clint Haney that was clocked at the AM Nike camp Both athletes play in Class A Malone and Haney both attended the UT minicamp Sunday then got offers Monday from the Longhorns due to the ridiculous new NCAA rule interpretation same old rule new legal interpretation that doesnt allow kids to commit at summer camps Normally both would have been offered by coach Mack Brown at the conclusion of their minicamp sessions Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee Arkansas Colorado Iowa State TCU and SMU He said ISU TCU and SMU had offered and North Lamar head coach Tom Felty said Tennessee Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they were preparing to offer his prize pupil Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado offers and several other schools who were recruiting him Malone who has been AllDistrict at quarterback and free safety and in basketball as a sophomore and junior was the districts sophomore of the year in both sports He has a great arm Felty said but what really makes him special is the way he sees the entire field He can find his second and third receivers and he never just locks onto one guy Hes also a very physical player Thats what makes him such a fine free safety and it also helps him at quarterback because he will hang in there until the last split second to get a completion even when he knows hes going to get decked There have been some questions about Malones speed but Felty said We play in a district with a lot of fast players and Ive never seen him caught from behind He ran for net yards rushing and four touchdowns and he had more than that but all quarterbacks get sacked and that brought his total down Hes a threat running or passing His passing is what attracted the Longhorns Playing for a young team he completed of passes for touchdowns and had seven interceptions Felty said Malone really loves to play football He even loves practice Sometimes I have the secondteam quarterback working and I see him over playing receiver for the scout team Hes ready to practice and ready to play every day Malone said he is happy to be a Longhorn Its a dream come true he said My coach told me he thought they were going to offer and I was hoping they would because I really want to play for the Longhorns Asked what he thinks are his strong suits he said I think I have a good arm and pretty good speed but I think mental attitude is really important and I play hard and play to win all of the time Haney who rushed times for yards yards per carry and touchdowns also was a big threat as a receiver catching passes for yards and four touchdowns for the Ramgers He said when he committed Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a football player He told me they want fast athletic kids and they would find a spot for me after I get there That spot could be running back but it probably will be wide receiver or defensive back Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class A playoffs last year and Haney said San Marcos defensive tackle Earl Anderson another UT pledge is really fast to be so big I broke about a yard touchdown run in that game and he was right behind me most of the way Im glad were going to be on the same side at Texas Asked why he picked the Longhorns he said Texas has great facilities and great coaches and its a firstclass academic institution With a grade average and a qualifying test score already he said the way the Longhorn coaches stressed academics along with athletics was a big factor in his decision The Longhorns other commitments are from OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona and DT Sonny Davis who signed with Texas last year but is having to go to a junior college in Mississippi because he failed to qualify academically Davis said he did so well in his first year in the JC that he has a chance to graduate in time to enroll at Texas next January and go through spring practice My next emailfax will be whenever events warrant The

Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Brown Says Benson Even Better Than We Thought He Was Texas coach Mack Brown has been cautious about putting extra pressure on RB Cedric Benson but he apparently has discovered the heralded freshman can handle it because he had lots of praise for him Sunday during the teams annual media day With reporters from several other Big cities in the audience Brown said Cedric Benson has a real flair with his vision quick feet power and determination Hes probably even better than we thought he was And Brown and his staff thought Benson was so good last year when he led Midland Lee to its third straight Class A championship and scored five touchdowns in the title game for the third straight time that they made him their No recruiting priority Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the Longhorns will go into the season with junior Victor Ike as the starting tailback and sophomore Ivan Williams and Benson splitting time with him on about an equal basis The Longhorn coaches have always stressed that their tailback must be adept at pass protection but they havent had a freshman with talent like Benson and they appear ready to make some adjustments to get him on the field Davis said Benson is behind Ike and Williams on pass protection because he has only been in the UT system a few days But Cedric has great maturity Davis said He has special talents and we will not let pass protection keep him from playing if he is the best back West Texas football is pressure packed particularly at the Class A level When Benson scored five TDs in the state title game for the second year in a row as a junior it looked impossible for him to do it for a third time because Midland Lees great offensive line graduated en masse TE Eric Winston a top recruit this year did start some as a sophomore but the other guys from tackle to tackle were all seniors The coaches of other Class A powers knew all they had to do to beat Midland Lee was stop Cedric Benson because the Rebels had no other offensive weapons of note With a green line it seemed like a simple chore The Rebels did lose a couple of early season games but the line kept getting better week by week and he led them to a third straight title scoring five TDs again as a senior this time against a powerful Austin Westlake defense that had shut out two straight foes to get to the championship game Excuse me for that history lesson but Benson is a special kind of running back and the UT coaches who already knew it are not too shy now about saying it because he has already shown hes ready for bigtime college football Davis also said the Longhorns have a great group of receivers particularly when the wide receivers and tight ends are lumped together as a group and he said QB Chris Simms gained much needed experience last year and he is much more mature this year He has had a great camp and has shown he is much more mature and much stronger He also said the offensive line will be much better this season because four of the five starters return and all of them are healthy for a change Defensive coordinator Carl Reese says he is still looking for a defensive tackle but he said the Longhorn defense should be pretty good Pretty good by Reeses standards means one that will rank in the top again He said Marcus Tubbs is solid at one tackle spot and said Maurice Gordon Adam Doiron and Stevie Lee will all split time fairly equally until one of them emerges as the starter at the other tackle spot Reese said defensive ends Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding are bigger and stronger and more determined this year Since Thornton made the freshman AllAmerica team last year after starting nine games as a true freshman and Redding is being touted as a preseason AllBig choice that is bad news for the oppostion RECRUITING NOTES For those of you who are wondering who will be the line backers next year true freshman Derrick Johnson looks like a guy who will play a lot on the weakside this year and then start and star for three more years and fellow freshman Aurmon Satchell is looking very good as a future strongside backer The middle is a little more unsettled for the

P O Box Austin Texas Phone Running Game Offensive Line Look Stout in Second Scrimmage When you have firstteam guys going against secondteam guys its hard to get a real feel for how things are progressing but I am going to predict right now that the Longhorns are going to be much better at running the ball in big games this season than they did last year That is not going out on a really big limb because the Horns simply had no rushing game in big games last season But the reasons I think they will be able to run the ball better when they need to this year are based on three sound reasons The scheme is better The team is working more on run blocking and has diversified to the extent that its hard to predict what the offense will do Last year it seemed there were only two running plays tailback off left tackle and tailback off right tackle Coach Mack Brown also is more determined to make the running game more dependable The offensive line is more experienced and healthier Guard Antwan KirkHughes is an outstanding lineman when he is healthy but he had a bad shoulder all last season Guardtackle Derrick Dockery also is very good but he lost pounds last season when he had a viral infection he couldnt shake Both of them are healthy and it is making a lot of difference in the quality of offensive line play The arrival of heralded recruit Cedric Benson has raised the level of play of the other tailbacks Benson has already shown he will be one of the mainstays of the running game Hes powerful fast elusive durable and has the field vision that all great running backs have which means he sees the hole and if there is no hole he sees the softest spot and hits it with lightning speed Ivan Williams a pound tank every spring and a pound patsy every fall has showed up in his tank form this fall He has been very impressive running with speed power and determination The starting tailback speedster Victor Ike is sporting new muscles and is running with more determination and consistency He also is getting to run some sweeps With Ike in the backfield sweeps can be deadly and they also can keep the defense from concentrating its forces between the tackles Look for all three guys to get close to equal time at least early in the season Okay enough of the analysis lets talk about the scrimmage Junior QB Chris Simms completed six of passes for yards and two touchdownhs all against the secondteam defense He would have been threeforthree in touchdowns but he slightly overthrew WR Sloan Thomas who was wide open on his third and final drive Coach Mack Brown worked the starters only about plays in the play scrimmage saying he wanted to look at the reserves to determine which ones need to be move up and which ones need to be demoted Senior QB Major Applewhite working with the second team against the firstteam defense completed of passes for yardes with one interception Redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock was of for yards but he was very impressive with his running For a pound quarterback he has remarkable speed Williams led the rushing with carries for yards followed by Sneezy Beltran with for Benson for and Ike for Benson already is the best of the group at making something out of nothing It takes a headon tackle to get him down and hes difficult to hit head on Sophomore WRs B J Johnson and Roy Williams caught the TD passes from Simms Johnsons was a yard TD play and Williams catch was a sevenyarder Defensively ends Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and freshman linebacker Derrick Johnson were outstanding The Longhorns open the season two weeks from today and most of the starting positions are set Nine starters return on offense and Ike will be the starter at tailback At left tackle the job is still open Dockery might slide over to tackle He has been working at tackle and guard If he moves to tackle Tillman Holloway will start at guard in his place Robbie Doane and Alfio Randall also are trying to win the starting job at left tackile Eight starters are back on defense but safety Lee Jackson has moved to linebacker creating another open position The Horns have to replace two starting tackles and two starting safeties with Jacksons move Sophomore Marcus Tubbs started several games at tackle last season and will be a starter against New Mexico State Sophomore Adam Doiron and redshirt freshman Stevie Lee are battling for the other tackle spot Senior Maurice Gordon will start against passing teams At the safety spots the coaches are alternating senior Ahmad Brooks and sophomores Nathan Vasher and Dakarai Pearson It looks like freshman walkon Dusty Mangum has won the placekicking job He has been very accurate up to yards JC transfer Brian Bradley is the punter and walkon TE Cullen Loeffler has been doing a fine job aof deep snapping Ike and Williams will be the primary kickoff returners and Vasher is the top punt returner RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns have stepped up their recruiting of WR Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls He has great leaping ability to go with his tall frame They also have made a lot of headway with Ath DaBryan Blanton of Forney who might be the nations fastest football player after that smoking fully automatic clocking in breaking the state meter record at the state track meet Hes a high school RB but at will be a WR or DB in college He has great hands to go with that awesome speed

P O Box Austin Texas Phone Williams Benson Star as Horns Stress Running Game in First Scrimmage Sophomore Ivan Williams the forgotten man at Texas and true freshman Cedric Benson the guy everyone cant wait to see were the offensive stars of the first Longhorn scrimmage of preseason football practice Thursday afternoon Williams had more opportunities than anyone else and he took advantage of them using his pound body to run for three touchdowns all on yard runs and to gain yards on carries Ivan really stepped up said head coach Mack Brown he weighs about pounds and he really did a good job for us today He showed a lot of power and determination Benson the phenom from Midland Lee had five carries for yards and also went yards with a swing pass from QB Chris Simms He made four yards on one play that looked like it would be a fouryard loss He has a great combination of speed power and cutback ability Cedric has great quickness and great vision Brown said Hes a tough kid too Rufus Harris freshman safety really belted him on one run and he just hopped back up and went back to the huddle like nothing had happened He ran the ball a lot at Midland Lee with everybody keying on him so hes already shown hes a tough runner The coaches stressed the running game in the scrimmage and Brown said that was because they had to work primarily on the passing game when they were in shorts and shells for the first several days of practice and also because Its important that we have a good running game He said the offense needs to make more timeconsuming drives to help keep our defense fresh Weve got to use our offense to help our defense out by controlling the clock a little more The right side of the offensive line with guard Antwan KirkHughes and tackle Mike Williams did a great job of run blocking throughout the scrimmage Simms also had a good day passing hitting of for yards and a touchdown on a yard completion to sophomore WR Sloan Thomas who made a great catch just before going out of bounds But this was a day for running backs to shine and starter Victor ike had yards on just four carries and also had a yard run with a short pass Redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran had yards on just two carries and junior Kenny Hayter had five carries for yards Sophomore DB Nathan Vasher had an yard kickoff return for a touchdown Walkon Mike Ungar had a yard touchdown catch on a long pass from redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock Senior QB Major Applewhite working with the secondteam offense primarily against the firstteam defense competed of passes for yards and sophomore safety Dakarai Pearson picked off one and would have run it in for a touchdown if the officials hadnt blown the play dead Mocks only completion in three attempts was the long TD strike to Ungar JC transfer Brian Bradfortd who appears to have nailed down the starting punting job had two punts with one going yards and the other going On the down side however he did have one blocked Freshman walkon Dusty Mangum of Mesquite was the starting place kicker and he was threeforthree on field goals from and yards out The Longhorns will practice at am and pm Friday at the Denius Fields before having a second scrimmage at am Saturday in Royal Memorial Stadium RECRUITING NOTES With commitments already the Longhorns are about halfway through recruiting Look for them to sign to more players with most of them coming from a group that includes DT Roderique Wright of Alief Hastings WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill DTOG Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park LB Aaron Harris

Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Benson Impressive in Full Pads Already Working with Second Team Freshman RB Cedric Benson had some impressive runs Wednesday night in the Longhorns first workout in full pads Benson set high school records that almost defy description like five touchdowns in three straight state championship games but the UT roster is full of high school stars and none of that counts when they reach the next level Benson looked a little tentative the first two times he carried the ball Wednesday night but then he reverted to the explosive running style that made him famous at Midland Lee simply exploding through the hole on play after play He also put on a good cutback move to make five yards on an end sweep that appeared to be going nowhere Its too early to say hes the answer to the Longhorns running back problems but he certainly made a good start in his first opportunity to impress the coaches Hes already playing a lot with the second team Junior OT Robbie Doane apparently stung by the coaches decision to train guard Derrick Dockery at his spot too because they felt it needed to be strengthened had the best practice of his career He even pancaked star DE Kalen Thornton once in the oneonone drills in which the defensive linemen try to get past the offensive linemen to sack the quarterback The best hit of the Wednesday night practice was one safety Phillip Geiggar put on star WR Roy Williams as Williams was grabbing a pass across the middle Geigger whacked him so hard Williams went one way and the ball went the other way Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he plans to shuffle four ends and four tackles against the passing teams on the Longhorns schedule He said Marcus Tubbs will be one of his starting tackles and he said the other one will be Maurice Gordon against passing teams and Stevie Lee or Adam Doiron against running teams He said DEs Thornton and Cory Redding will start agains everybody but he said converted linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins will play a lot against the passing teams Reese also said he has been very impressed with freshman CB Aaron Ross and might use him when he plays five defensive backs against the passoriented teams He also said Cedric Griffin another freshman CB has looked good since his return from a sprained ankle and might figure in the rotation Head coach Mack Brown said sophomore WR B J Johnson is starting to play like he did in high school making guys miss and picking up big yardage after the catch Johnson was rated as the nations top wide receiver recruit by several national recruiting services but has been overshadowed at Texas by fellow sophomore Williams who broke UTs true freshman record for receiving yardage last season The Longhorn coaches have put in more sweeps and misdirection plays to make the offense less predictable and on defense new secondary coach Duane Aki na has put in some new coverages designed to confuse opposing quarterbacks by making a zone defense out of what looks like a manforman defense and vice versa The sweeps are a big help for starting TB Victor Ike the fastest running back in the UT stable He can run inside but he is very dangerous on sweeps because of his outstanding speed Akina also said his defensive backs at Texas have more talent than most of the great defenses he coached at Arizona in the famed Desert Swarm defense He said there are several DBs at Texas who have pro potential after their college careers are over The Longhorns will have their first full scrimmage of the preseason Thursday at pm in Royal Memorial Stadium Then they will practice at am and pm Friday at the Denius Fields before having a second scrimmage at am Saturday in Royal Memorial Stadium RECRUITING NOTES The threegame suspension drawn by the states top wide receiver Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus is not his first brush with trouble and probably will cause the Longhorns to slow down their efforts to recruit him Brown shies away from problem athletes generally and Timmons drawing a suspension for an unidentified offense is a real negative Obviously this is not something I would like to see quoted on the internet I try to be frank with all of you but it would not be helpful to UT for this to be bandied about publicly The Longhorns still have commitments There are some great recruits like LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite RB Aaron Hardy of Galena Park DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings DTOG Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo and WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill who are national top players who strongly favor the Horns but of that grolup only Johnson is likely to commit in the near future He plans to try to come to the Horns opener on his official visit and is a good bet to commit when he does My next emailfax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange EMailFax Service includes at least faxemails a year and costs by EMail The True Orange Newsletter includes

O Box Austin Texas Phone Dockery Training at Tackle Sendlein Moves to Defensive Line With three experienced offensive guards and only one experienced offensive tackle the Longhorn coaches moved junior guard Derrick Dockery to left tackle Tuesday and head coach Mack Brown said he will be cross trained at both guard and tackle Redshirt freshman middle linebacker Austin Sendlin who was running second team behind starter DeAndre Lewis was moved to defensive tackle Tuesday Junior college All American Alfio Randall might win the starting job at offensive left tackle but even if that happens the coaches will have only five players they feel they can count on two play the four guard and tackle spots Senior Mike Williams is an AllAmerica candidate at right tackle and senior Antwan KirkHughes is very solid at right guard Sophomore Tillman Holloway started several games at left guard last year and played well Holloway and Dockery had been expected to battle for the starting job at left guard but the crosstraining of Dockery could mean he will start at tackle and provide relief at guard when Randall is in the game Brown said the coaches would like to have three tackles and three guards to alternate but he said they can get by with five for the two positions if one of them is cross trained and there are no injuries Moving Sendlein to defensive tackle opens a secondteam spot at middle linebacker but defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Maurice Wilkins a former linebacker who has been moved to defensive end could be pulled back and used at middle backer if Lewis gets hurt or needs a breather He also said redshirt freshman Rashad Thomas might make a good backup in the middle Wilkins and another former linebacker Reed Boyd were moved to defensive end after O J McClintock who was the backup at both end spots suffered severe cuts to his right arm and hand in a household accident McClintock is expected to miss the first two or three games Brown said the plan at quarterback this year with junior starter Chris Simms senior backup Major Applewhite and redshirt freshman Chance Mock is to win the game with Chris and Major then use Chance We hope we have some games where we can use all three Applewhite who holds most school passing and total offense records has been hampered by severe injuries to both his knees but he has been looking a lot sharper in the preseason than he did during spring football practice Brown said Simms is the clear starter but he said the coaches have great confidence in both Simms and Applewhite He also said senior linebackers Lewis and Everick Rawls have been really good players for us but we need somebody to step up and have a great year in there He said the other senior linebacker starter former safety Lee Jackson is an outstanding player who really is still a safety but is just playing closer to the line He said the coaches decided to move Jackson to linebacker because they play so many passing teams that it helps to have a linebacker with experience as a defensive back and because Jackson is a fine tackler and outstanding blitzer True freshman RB Cedric Benson explodes into the line quicker than any of the veteran running backs and true freshman LB Derrick Johnson is the fastest linebacker on the team True freshman DT Kaelen Jakes continues to impress in the passrushing drills He is super quick and has great moves to put on the offensive linemen RECRUITING NOTES The states top running back Albert Hardy of Galena Park came to a Longhorn practice last week and now he is listing Texas as his favorite team again He had moved LSU ahead of the Horns briefly after an unofficial visit to Baton Rouge but the Longhorns moved out front again after his trip to Austin Glenn Jackson a fine outside linebacker prospect who also plays defensive end at Carrollton Turner is about and and has the frame to add or pounds and become a passrusher deluxe in college with his speed and sure tackling skills He and Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar are both being recruited by Texas and most other top schools because they are very fast very sure tacklers and both have frames that will let them grow into big linebackers or mediumsized

O Box Austin Texas Phone Brown Pleased With Teams Conditioning Attitude Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorn players showed up in great condition and have worked very hard during the first week of preseason football practice He also said he is very encouraged by the work of freshmen walkon kickers David Pino and Dusty Mangum who have been pretty consistent on short and mediumrange field goals Heading into twoaday workouts he said finding a good placekicker was one of the keys to having a good season Pino and Mangum seldom miss inside yards and he said that is very encouraging Brown said the players are hungry to have a great season and he said the bowl loss to Oregon probably has contributed to that hunger I think ending the season on a losing note has made some of our young players hungrier he said noting that sophomore WRs Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas realize they have to work hard every day to get better They were tremendous as true freshman and helped this team win nine games he said but they are bigger and stronger and more experienced now and they can take it to another level this year True freshman CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes had missed several practices with a sprained ankle but he had an impressive outing in Monday mornings practice covering super sophomore WR Roy Williams like a blanket on several successive plays When I asked new DB coach Duane Akina about Griffins performance he grinned and said Hey you watch whats going on Thats good I thought all you guys did was take notes He said Griffin and all the other freshmen DBs have talent and are working hard True freshman DT Kaelen Jakes continues to be impressive in the oneonone passrushing drills He has been almost unstoppable against all the top offensive linemen in that drill At pounds he is light for a tackle but he shows great passrushing skills Junior DE Cory Redding who led the team in sacks last season with has developed some new moves to get around blockers and he and fellow DE Kalen Thornton who started nine games last year as a true freshman both have looked very good Brown said the two young defensive ends are both bigger and stronger and more experienced now and they can still run We are counting on them to be even more productive this season and they have been very productive in the past Linebacker Reed Boyd who has been working with the defensive ends also is an accomplished pass rusher The players wont be in full pads until their Wednesday afternoon workout but they are wearing helmets and shoulder pads and they have been hitting each other pretty hard at times RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns probably will get a commitment from WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill the weekend of the season opener against New Mexico State and they probably will find out the following weekend when they play North Carolina if they are going to get DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel Johnson plans to take his official visit to UT the August weekend and see the Horns Sept opener against NM State I can see myself in burnt orange he told me adding that he might commit on that visit He also said there is no one close to the Longhorns right now Pittman has narrowed his choices to Texas and LSU and the Longhorns have dedicated the North Carolina game to the memory of Cole Pittman Chases older brother who was killed in an automobile accident in February while he was returning to Austin to participate in spring football practice Cole Pittman was a promising sophomore defensive tackle at the time of his tragic death If Chase Pittman doesnt commit to the Horns that weekend or right after that weekend I think their chances diminish considerably With commitments already the Longhorns have to be pretty selective about the recruits they take to fill their final dozen or so spots Look for the most of the final spots to go to defensive linemen Kasey Studdard the national top lineman from Highlands Ranch Colo is a dominating defensive tackle and is being recruited by lots of schools including Texas for his defensive skills But he also is a tremendous prospect as an offensive guard or center He is one of the bet blockers I have seen on tape this year A bunch of Longhorn football players are going to be at the gates for the Round Rock Express game Saturday night collecting on behalf of the Cole Pittman Memorial Fund This is the fund that directly benefits Shreveport Evangel High School and will go to build their fieldhouse and the statue of Cole to be put in front The players will include Chance Mock Cory Redding Stevie Lee O J McClintock Chad Stevens Cullen Loeffler and a few more No one needs to be reminded who Cole was and what a special person he was to the whole Longhorn family It will be an informal event Lots of Longhorn players will be there in their jerseys between and p m Theyll be at the gates with buckets to accept donations from about pm until gametime at PM Marc Pittman

P O Box Austin Texas Phone Longhorns Have First FullTeam Practices UT Ranked No by AP The Longhorns had their first two fullteam practices Saturday and coach Mack Brown said he is pleased with the way the players went all out in both drills Were doing it a little differently this year Brown said noting that he is alternating between two workouts a day and one workout a day When he has two workouts like he did Saturday there is an early morning and a late evening workout Then he follows that with a single workout at pm the next day like he is doing Sunday We havent started well here he said pointing to four earlyseason losses since he has been at Texas It doesnt get as hot in North Carolina as it does here so we checked with some pro teams in hotweather cities and were doing what they do He said all coaches are concerned about the football deaths that have occurred in pro and college football already this preseason and he said the early and late workouts should help players avoid losing so much fluid He has always had water breaks in practice and he is still having frequent water breaks Brown talked about problem areas in the preseason and he mentioned three the loss of both starting defensive tackles the lack of a proven tailback and the necessity of finding two new kickers one to do the punting and one to do the place kicking He said sophomore Marcus Tubbs who is close to pounds and very quick played well last year when Shaun Rogers was hurt and looks good at one defensive tackle Redshirt freshman Stevie Lee and sophomore Adam Doiron both worked some with the first team at the other tackle Lee is coming off foot surgery but showed no signs of weakness and looked good Former defensive end Maurice Gordon looked great as a passrushing tackle in the spring and he still looks very quick and very formidable Brown said he hopes junior Victor Ike will step up at tailback and also said the coaches want to look at highly touted freshmen Cedric Benson Ike worked very hard in the off season and is sporting some new muscles He said JC transfer Brian Bradford is looking very good as the team punter and said he is encouraged with the placekicking of true freshman walkons David Pino and Dusty Mangum Linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins worked at defensive end Saturday Brown said they will continue to work at linebacker too but might play some at end until O J McClintock returns McClintock is out indefinitely after suffering slashed muscles and tendons when he accidentally rammed his hand and arm though a window Texas was ranked fifth in the nation in the preseason Associated Press Top Poll which was released Saturday It was the Longhorns highest preseason ranking since being ranked No in The Horns received five first place votes and were one of five schools to earn votes for the top spot Florida opens the season at No followed by Miami Oklahoma Nebraska and Texas giving the Big three of the top five spots The Longhorns have been in the top in of AP polls since head coach Mack Brown took over in December of The No ranking by the AP writers comes one week after the ESPNUSA Today Coaches and Football Writers Association of America tabbed UT No in their preseason poll One positive factor that gives this team a better chance to finish in the top than Browns previous teams at Texas is the overall depth His second team at UT was and on a roll when the wide receivers and starting QB Major Applewhite got hurt sick or in the case of Kwame Cavil got suspended It lost its last three games This team has much better depth and is two deep in quality players at most positions RECRUITING NOTES The states top running back Albert Hardy of Galena Park was at Saturday mornings practice and he drew a lot of attention from all the UT coaches He looks at least as big as the he is supposed to be He is a power runner deluxe with speed to take it to the outside The offense UT has run since the present staff arrived is ideal for him The states top player DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings attended one of the Thursday practices and he also drew lot of attention from the coaches One reason he is so highly rated and I rated him highly before anyone else way back last September when he was just starting his junior year is that b lockers dont slow him down very much Singleteams doubleteams even tripleteams are just minor nuisances for him He stays so low and is so explosive that the best chance to avoid him is to run away from him as fast as possible Two UT commitments also attended Longhorn practices this week WR Dustin Miksch of Roud Rock Westwood was at the Saturday morning practice and LB Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally was at one of the Thursday drills My next emailfax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange

P O Box Austin Texas Phone Longhorn Veterans Report Ellis Wyndham Only Players Missing Senior linebacker Jon Wyndham and sophomore tight end Artie Ellis were the only Longhorn veterans missing Thursday when the other scholarship varsity players reported to begin preseason practice Head coach Mack Brown said Wyndham a senior who has played primarily on special teams during his career did not report with the team due to unresolved medical issues that are unrelated to football He said the medical issues might cause Wyndham to miss the fall semester He did not elaborate He said Ellis who played in seven games and caught eight passes for yards as a receiver last year is taking the fall semester off for personal reasons and to further recover from a stress fracture in his tibia That injury limited his action in and sidelined him during spring drills He moved to tight end last spring and Brown said the coaches expect him to return in January for the spring semester Wyndham is not expected to return to the team I really want to be with my teammates and help the program he said but I need to take care of myself first I came here to play football and get an education and even if I dont play again I want to leave here with a degree Id like to thank my coaches and teammates for all their support Ellis said but it is in my best interest at this time to take care of my personal issues and to further recover from my stress fracture I wish the Longhorns the best of luck this season and look forward to coming back strong next January The veterans joined the freshmen for a team meeting Thursday night and both groups will go through orientation Friday before their first full team workout at am Saturday at Frank Denius Field at the corner of th Street and Red River Obviously this group of veterans is excited to get things started Brown said A lot of them have been here all summer and several of the guys have been out at the freshmen workouts the past two days But todays reporting day is what we have been waiting for since the spring game With a couple of exceptions we now have everyone here The guys have tomorrow off to focus on academics and to get acquainted with the newcomers and then well get down to business on the field Saturday Coach Brown also reset Sundays practice for pm He had said Wednesday he would move it to the early morning but he said Thursday he decided to keep in it the afternoon because the teams second workout Saturday will be at pm and he said he thought the players needed more rest before the Sunday practice RECRUITING NOTES The

Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone UT Close to Super Pledge Freshmen Practices End WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill told me today he is very close to committing to Texas and might do so in the very near future I can see myself in burnt orange he said Texas is a great program with great coaches and great players and it means a lot to me that the Texas coaches thought highly enough of me to tell me they think I can help them achieve their goals of competing for and winning a national championship Johnson who lives only three blocks from the University of Illinois campus told me Texas is clearly his top choice right now and there is no one else really in the picture I dont mind leaving home he said I really like everything about Texas and I just want to be very sure about it before I commit Johnson is the best wide receiver Ive seen on tape this year Hes big and fast and will make the tough catch in traffic when he knows he is fixing to get blasted If sophomore WR Roy Williams has a great year dont be surprised if he opts for the NFL after this season I know the NFL leaves kids alone until after their junior years but I dont think the NCAA or the NFL would risk a court suit on the issue Thats why getting another great wide receiver is so important this year and Johnson has all the tools to be a great one at the next level The Longhorn freshmen wrapped up their workouts Wednesday and coach Mack Brown said he is very pleased with their progress The freshmen worked out twice Tuesday and twice Wednesday With the varsity reporting Thursday the next workouts will be Saturday at am and pm and they will involve the entire team Its too early to say which freshmen can help this year but DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia California has some moves to get by blockers that I havent seen at Texas since Aaron Humphrey was here He looks like a guy who could really help alleviate the shortage of defensive linemen At and and with an explosive start hes big enough to play tackle and fast enough to play end Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Jakes has a chance to help quickly because we need somebody to help in the defensive line and he looks like he has the tools and the temperament to do it The four freshmen walkon kickers continued competing Wednesday and so far it looks like David Pino of Wichita Falls Rider and Brady Noto of Katy Taylor are the most accurate place kickers while Dusty Mangum of Mesquite might have the strongest leg All the kickers tried field goals from about yards and then about yards Pino and Noto were the only ones who made a fair percentage from the greater distance Of course they get harder to make when defenders are trying to block them so a lot will depend on how the young kickers respond to pressure Pino also got off some long high punts and Brown said he was impressed that Pino was able to do both jobs with such proficiency JC transfer Alfio Randall who is being counted on to challenge for a starting job at offensive tackle finally was cleared for workouts Wednesday and participated in the afternoon drill He had to have some blood tests redone because the first ones werent productive Three freshmen were limping Wednesday and were held out of the drills DB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes sprained ankle DB Rufus Harris of La Porte sore quad muscle and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferson stress fracture in foot couldnt practice but Brown said he hopes Griffin and Harris will be able to work out when the team practices again on Saturday Brown also said Eric Hall of Clarksville Tennessee who had been ticketed for a try at fullback wants to play defensive end so thats where hell start out He also said Brian Carter of The Woodlands wants to play wide receiver and will remain at that spot for now He also could be a defensive back Walkon WR Kyle Shanahan who is expected to be one of the teams top backups suffered a puncture wound in his thigh while jumping a fence but Brown said there is a good chance he will be back by the first game IMPORTANT NOTICE TO FANS WHO ATTEND PRACTICE The practice schedule calls for a pm practice Sunday but Brown said that practice will be moved to Sunday morning and wont start later than am He said it could start as early as am When he announces the time Ill let you know My next emailfax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange EMailFax

FW True Orange EMailFax AM Original Message From SMTP Sent Tuesday August PM To Subject True Orange EMailFax True Orange EMailFax Service Volume EMailFax Tuesday August Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Freshman Hold First Workouts Impress Coaches The Longhorns heralded freshmen had their first pair of workouts Tuesday and coach Mack Brown and his staff said they are very pleased with their newest group of recruits They are big and fast and talented Brown said We are still glad we recruited all of them JC transfer Alfio Randall who is being counted on to challenge for a starting job at offensive tackle was held out of Tuesdays workouts because the doctors who conduct tests on all the team members said some of his blood tests need to be repeated Brown said there was no indication from the doctors that there was a problem but he said no players will work out until they have been thoroughly tested and cleared by the doctors Two freshmen were nursing injuries DB Rufus Harris of La Porte has a sore quad muscle from one of the AllStar games and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferson turned up with an old stress fracture in his foot His injury probably will keep him out of action for a while but Harris should be able to work out soon Brown also said junior DE O J McClintocks arm and hand injuries might cause him to miss about half the season but he also said he might be able to make it back quicker than that McClintock suffered glass cuts to his arm and hand in a household accident last week and underwent emergency surgery With McClintock on the shelf at least temporarily the only two outofstate freshmen Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn were getting close looks from the coaches because the Horns are thin in the defensive line With the players working without pads its difficult to tell very much but Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese both said they like the way Jakes runs and like his athleticism Reese also said Hall has a chance to play ear ly because of the shortage of defensive ends Reese also said the class of defensive backs is the best as a group since weve been here They all have speed and the ability to cover manforman Offensive coordinator Greg Davis also praised the arm strength of his freshman QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch Nordgren threw several passes more than yards in the afternoon practice Tuesday and he threw them with some zip and good accuracy The four walkon kickers also were drawing close attention and all four of them showed good leg strength and pretty good accuracy They are Brady Noto from Katy Taylor David Pino from Wichita Falls Rider Dusty Mangum from Mesquite and James Baker from Austin Westlake Brown said he thinks all four of them have some talent and said the coaches hope one or two of them will be able to help solve the teams placekicking problems He said one thing that hampered all the kickers Tuesday was that none of the freshmen have experience as holders Brian Carter a WRDB from The Woodlands appeared to do a good job of holding in a pinchhit role Brown said some of the freshmen OLs are going to have to drop some weight He didnt name anyone but William Winston of Houston Madison and Terrance Young of Longview both appear to weigh well above pounds The freshmen will practice again at am and pm on Wednesday The varsity reports Thursday and the first full squad practice will be Saturday at am All the practices are open to the public RECRUITING NOTES LB Brian Robison of Splendora one of the Longhorns dozen early commitments got word from Norfolk Va late Monday night that he had been named the outstanding male performer at the AAU Junior Olympics in Norfolk As I reported in yesterdays emailfax he broke his own national AAU Junior Olympic record by winning the discus with a throw and was second in the shot and sixth in the javelin The Longhorns have commitments from DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos who is No on my list of the states top difference makers Robison who is No and OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood who is No They also are running No with several other members of that elite group including No DT Rodriquie Wright of Alief Hastings No LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite No DT Marco Martin of Mesquite and No DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac They are tied for the lead with some of other difference makers but they are clearly in the lead with the four I cited My next emailfax will be Wednesday August The True Orange EMailFax Service includes at least faxemails a year and costs by EMail The True Orange
