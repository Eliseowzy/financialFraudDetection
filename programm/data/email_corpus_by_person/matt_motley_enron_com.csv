<12708011.1075862020715.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,matt.motley@enron.com,2001-11-20 08:37:32,FW BCS per ESPN Computer GeekMonday November BCS bowls starting to fill up By Brad Edwards Special to ESPNcom Two spots are now taken Six spots remain But the two most enviable positions in the Bowl Championship Series are still up for grabs The next couple of weekends maybe three will decide which teams play for the national title although the list of potential competitors seems to be shrinking Stock up Oklahoma The Sooners are just two wins away from Pasadena as are Nebraska and Miami The difference however is that one of Oklahomas remaining games is at home against a team with a record Oklahoma State Rivalry games are often unpredictable but the Cowboys dont have much of a chance in this one Not this year Not against this team That puts OU in the Big title game against the winner of NebraskaColorado Its a neutralfield game for a chance to defend their national title and a team with a loss cant ask for much more than that Stock down BYU The Cougars keep winning which of course is the object of football But a very weak schedule and some tiny victory margins arent earning them any respect in the computers And even though BYU is more interested in gaining admiration from Fiesta Bowl reps than from computer analysts it wont do them any good unless they reach the top of the final BCS Standings If they do get that high in the rankings is certainly an advantage to have a fan base within driving distance of Arizona at a time when many Americans are hesitant to fly But the reality is that the Fiesta Bowl is being played in the traditional Rose Bowl time slot on New Years Day and will likely have Pac champion Oregon as one of its participants With that much in place the Big Ten champ becomes a very attractive opponent especially if that team is Michigan Its too bad for BYU that the Wolverines dodged the upset bullet over the weekend Michigan is just one home victory away from being in the BCS pool and its very tough to imagine any bowl selecting the Cougars over the Wolverines given a choice between the two BYU has a good team a good name and a loyal following of fans but they cant match Michigans drawing power Unless the Fiesta Bowl believes it needs the Cougars to sell out the stadium they probably wont be going to Tempe to ring in the New Year BYU won its national title by beating Michigan in the Holiday Bowl but this bowl battle is likely to be won be the Maize and Blue Under the radar The ACC Maryland and Pac Oregon have both determined their BCS representative and the Big East Miami is all but official And one way or the other the Big Ten champion will also be determined by this Saturday So even though the Big and SEC teams wont be decided until December its time to start making some guesses about who will get the atlarge bids The reality is that there wont be many teams to choose from If Tennessee had lost to Kentucky and Michigan had lost to Wisconsin on Saturday both of which almost happened that might have presented a scenario in which there were no eligible atlarge teams from the ACC Big East Big Ten or SEC And since the Big cant get more than two teams into the BCS and Oregon has already played both Stanford and Washington State everything would have played perfectly into the hands of an undefeated BYU The order of choice by the BCS bowls is dependent upon which teams are playing for the national title but if things play out according to form and a Big team finishes at No the Fiesta will get the first pick If they choose the Big Ten champion the Sugar Bowl will likely take another Big team with one atlarge selection and the other choice should be the TennesseeFlorida loser to the Orange Bowl If the Fiesta does take BYU as an atlarge pick that second team from the Big would go to either the Sugar or the Orange Florida still needs two losses from the group of Nebraska Miami and Oklahoma to have a good chance to reach the Rose Bowl but they might have been in even bigger trouble if not for a narrow escape by Tennessee over the weekend The Vols are the only team the Gators can still get bonus points for a win against and those would have been all but gone if Tennessee had lost to Kentucky Oklahoma is certainly in good shape if they win out and all else goes according to form but there is one what if scenario to think about If Texas loses at Texas AM and Colorado beats Nebraska on Friday would Oklahoma still finish higher than Florida if both teams win out The Texas loss would cost the Sooners some bonus points and the Nebraska loss would prevent them from having an opportunity to pick up more Its too early to know the impact of that series of events but it is something for OU fans to think about over Thanksgiving dinner Texas has been all but eliminated from the national title hunt after Oklahomas win at Texas Tech The only remaining hope for the Longhorns is an Oklahoma State upset of the Sooners in Norman Good luck If Colorado beats Nebraska this week and then Oklahoma the following week in the Big Championship Game that might leave Texas as the highest ranked team from the conference but it would not be enough to get them into the BCS top two unless Florida or Miami also loses If the season ended today The top three still look the same and all those behind them are trying to keep hope alive Official BCS standings Nebraska Miami Oklahoma Florida Oregon Texas Tennessee Illinois Stanford Michigan BCS Game of the Week Nebraska at Colorado Its hard to believe a team could be without winning any type of crown but thats the reality the Cornhuskers carry into Boulder The winner of this game gets the Big North championship and a trip to Dallas for the conference title A loss might instead send Nebraska to Dallas for the Cotton Bowl This game is not only to keep the Huskers title hopes alive but as referenced above it could also have an effect on the BCS futures of Oklahoma Texas and Florida as well as Tennessee and Oregon Throw in the fact that this game normally comes down to the wire and you can sense the drama it might present all across the country Brad Edwards is a college football researcher for ESPN Inside the BCS appears weekly
