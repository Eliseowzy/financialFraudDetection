Netting Agreement The MNA has already been executed and there is no such rep in the agreement Is this a rep that should be included in our form of MNA If so Ill need to let Mary Cook know that the

with Lech Leslie Original Message From Lech Kalembka ENRON Sent Monday November AM To Hansen Leslie Cc Heard Marie Cook Mary David Mitchell Subject RE FW You should probably ask them about their status as a transmitting utility They should provide a related representation in the agreement Insofar as we are working on numerous filings I wonder if it would be efficient to centralize the process of obtaining the organizational ID numbers with my paralegal who as previously noted can get the numbers from CT Corp As you know this will cost per entity but might well save money by streamlining

Collateral Annex to the Reliant Master Netting Agreement didnt realize you needed to see it as well By this email I am requesting that Marie coordinate with you to get you Reliants organizational ID number How do I go about confirming that Reliant Energy Services Inc is not a transmitting utiltity Local counsel will handle the Canadian entity Regards Leslie Hansen See attached file Reliant MNA Collateral Annex FINALdoc Original Message From Lech Kalembka ENRON Sent Saturday November PM To Hansen Leslie Cc Cook Mary David Mitchell Subject Re FW As a threshold matter I note that the basic purpose of the UCC filings is to belt and suspender the crossparty netting provisions of the MNA by having the counterpartyies grant a security interest in the counterpartys receivables from Enron This is typically accomplished through the grant of a security interest in Obligations under the MNA In this case however I do not find in the Collateral provisions Section the Obligations included Is this collateral covered in a related Collateral Annex Alternatively is this omission an oversight or a deliberate choice by the parties If we do intend to have a security interest in the counterpartys receivables and these are not picked up in the CA the MNA should be revised accordingly Also if we are going to file against the receivables we will need to know the organizational ID number of Reliant Energy Services Inc and its address Regarding the Canadian entity I assume you will consult with local counsel Finally we would also need to confirm for UCC filing purposes that the Delaware entity is not a transmitting utility ie an entity primarily engaged in the production or transmission of electricity or the transmission of goods by pipeline Thank you Lech Kalembka Cadwalader

chance triggers the requirement for a licence Generally this would not be a problem but as Mallesons observed the licensing of gambling on the internet is major political issue and we should not expect a permit to be granted at an administrative level Hence delays should be expected There is zero chance of us getting approval to use Sydney Olympic names and images They have already been sold off The use of the Olympic name etc is reserved to partners who have tipped in millions I did a quick check of the net and found that there is already a sweepstakes being run on behalf of these partners It appears that the sweepstakes includes global partners such as IBM and hence there might be restrictions in other jurisdictions on running a game in competition to it The legislation is broadly drafted to pick up any use of Olympic and related terms The Act is additional to normal trademark legislation and is designed to stop unauthorised orgainisations associating themselves with

employees will be permitted to participate although there may be restrictions placed on their ability to win prizes In light of this fact and the information contained in your memorandum I have several follow up questions The game is open without entry fee or charge Does this make a difference under the lottery legislation outlined in the memo or do you believe we will still need to seek a permit If it will be necessary to obtain a permit we would like to proceed as quickly as possible in trying to obtain one With regard to the use of the Sydney Olympics etc names and symbols we would like to proceed as quickly as possible to obtain a license to use the names It is vital that we obtain the right to use these symbols in the promotion and hosting of this game Notwithstanding the

ECT ECT ECT John CT Alan CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Whilst it appears to be an excellent marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified On what you have told me there are two potential issues My initial view is that sweepstake may be considered a lottery under New South Wales the State where Enron is based gaming laws If this correct then we will need a license I should be able to confirm this later today We will also need to check the other Australian States where we have counterparties There also significant public debate on internet gambling in Australia Recently the Federal Government indicated that it would move to regulate the area The second relates to passing items of value to employees of companies with whom we do business To be frank I am uncomfortable with any arrangement that could result in this occurring unless we had the informed consent of the employer Apart from the negative fallout that may result we are we also need to be mindful that in Australia a number of our counterparties are Government owned utilities This does raise questions as the possible application of the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act On the facts available I could not preclude a circumstance arising that could be viewed as not in compliance with that Act Leslie some further facts will assist How will the offer be made will it just be on the website or will promotional material also be sent Which Enron entity will be making the offer Who can play Will it only be the master user or can anyone with a password play To whom would the prize be given Would it go to the individual or would the prize be given to the company with no possibility of it being intercepted by the individual Japan will also have some issues relating to gaming which I am sure Anne at BM will be able to advise on Do we need to check on the situation in Singapore Sorry to throw up all these problems but this proposal does have some real issues atleast on the facts given in your email Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc John nron Alan CT Subject EOL Sports Game As we have discussed either directly or indirectly EnronOnline is interested in offering an online sweepstakes game to its customers The game will be based upon the Olympic games and is similar in concept to a fantasy football league A participant selects several countries as its team and accumulates points based upon the medals earned by its countries in the Olympic games Unlike fantasy football however there is no entry fee to win and no other form of payment is required from participants Prizes eg big screen tv camcorder will be awarded based upon highest points accumulated I have asked each of you to research any prohibitions on such a game in the following jurisdictions Jim Canada Anne Japan David Australia I need to know if these jurisdictions impose any restrictions on such a game Can we make the game available to all EnronOnline customers in each of these jurisdictions What if any procedures andor requirements must we meet in order to offer the game If we cannot permit

be most appreciated Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter Regards Leslie Hansen

HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Dave CT Subject Re Enron game Rachel I dont think were going to be interested in reimbursing for connection costs so I think we should just keep France in the lists of not approved With regard to the data protection issue I have actually sent Justin an email on this various issue to determine if our current legal privacy language is sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules I will forward you that email If you go into the Registration Screen of the demo game you will see that individual participants will be required to enter their name email address and telephone number I look forward to your comments on this issue Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron game Dear Leslie France I have now read through the French advice The DGCCRF lottery regulators have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet communication This means that the game probably does fall foul of French lottery legislation One way round this might be to offer to reimburse connection costs If this is done then there are still a couple of indirect contribution issues to sort out these relate to being seen not to promote Enron and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions although French law on these matters is generally stricter There is also a possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed to adjudicate in the case of disupute but I get the impression from the French advice that this could probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible if it isnt then there is presumably little point in tidying up the indirect contribution and bailiff issues The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded ie there must be an expectation of profitgain Hence in theory not awarding the prize to a French resident should allow the game to be played in France The French lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically I am not sure I understand their concerns and have asked them for clarification I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies together with employees of other Enron Customers for example UK companies who happen to reside in France I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification that such exclusions would suffice and will forward you the essence of their replies I set out below a list of countries where the game would be lawful providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country Netherlands Belgium Sweden France subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns Italy As mentioned in my previous email some of these countries may move into the approved list anyway I have not received express advice on this particular issue from Norway but there advice implies that not awarding prizes would be ok and if the tax issue scan be sorted out Norway may move to the approved list anyway I will however ask them to confirm the not awarding prizes point for completeness I have not received advice on this point from Spain You may recall that for the Euro game colleagues in Belgium were concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents then this needs to be made very clear from an early stage so that Enron are not misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be awarded a prize if they are not going to be If ineligbility for prizes is placed prominently in the rules and partcipants have to read the rules before playing then I guess that this covers this issue Although none of the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point I think it would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an online registration process are Spain based on previous Euro advice Italy Netherlands Denmark Sweden Belgium but note the comments made re Euro that there is a very slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential difficulties ie Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium participants had been properly advised of their ineligibility Belgium law requires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers Rules I have not had chance to review the rules in detail One issue that may be important from a European point of view is data protection ie protection of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to trnsfer data I will look into this and let you know As mentioned above the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need to be included in the eligibility section Miscellaneous One issue which was touched upon in a previous email was whether the word Olympic could be used in a disclaimer I will look into this further and get back to you on this matter next week As requested I will summarize the Olympic advice for you also Regards Rachel This

Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Subject Re Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Rachel Thank you so much for the feedback I will follow up later this morning to address those questions that have yet to be answered With regard to a summary of your Olympic research in other jurisdictions I would very much appreciate a summary Thanks Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Thank you for your emails I set out below the advice we have received from the various jurisdictions Countries that can be added to the approved list We have now received the advice from Portugal and as with the Euro game the High Five Flag Game does not violate Portugese law because participants do not have to pay to enter and because it is run outside Portugal so you can add Portugal to the list of approved jurisdictions Finland can now also be added to the approved list The game would not be considered a lottery as the players would not pay to enter It should not be considered a restricted marketing measure providing there is no obligation to purchase goods which I understand is the situation Tax issues were also initially a concern ie it was thought that Enron might be liable to pay tax if it awarded a prize to a Finnish citizen However after discussions with the relevant tax authorities this tax issue seems to have fallen away because Enron as a foreign organiser would not have any liabilites towards the Finnish tax office If a Finnish citizen won the prize they themselves might have to pay tax on it but I assume that this is not a concern of Enron since they themselves would not have liability towards the Finnish tax office Countries that could possibly be added to the approved list provided certain facts are confirmed with either Enron or the regulatory authoritesandor further information is provided As with Euro Poland is also looking likely the Polish lawyers require me to confirm that Enrons customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to do so in the future It is my understanding that this is the case so assuming this is correct Poland could be added to the approved list Belgium it is unclear under Belgium law whether the game is a Games of Chance a Lottery or a Contest They need to forward a demo to the regulatory authorities I have not yet checked whether the demo sent yesterday is complete enough our web access was very slow thsi morning but as suggested in your email I will contact Dave Samuels if I need a substantially more complete demo Italy Approval is needed in Italy if the game is an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents The scheme would be classified as an advertising contest the key is whether it is addressed to Italian residents Our Italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will be in Italy and would like us to confirm that the site will be in English and from a server located in the UK In order to obtain approval the Italian lawyers need to know whether Enron has a subsidiary in Italy if it does the application needs to be made on behalf of this company if it doesnt have an Italian subsidiary then they cannot actually apply for approval of the scheme An integral feature of being an advertising contest is that a prize is awarded so if Italian participants are excluded from being awarded a prize the game wont be an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents Sweden The game is a lottery under Swedish law and therefore requires approval which there is virtually no chance of Enron obtaining because it is not a charitable organisation if it is addressed to the Swedish public as a general rule more than people Our Swedish lawyers therefore need to know how many participants there are in Sweden if it is less than then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead but I will confirm this with them Norway There are four issues affecting the game in Norway these are whether the game is a lottery whether the game is a money game whether the game promotes a business and tax issues After informal talks with the relevant ministries th first two issues have fallen away and are now no longer a problem The Norwegian lawyers had some concerns as to whether the purpose of the scheme was to promote Enron but I believe that if I can confirm to them that customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to so in the future ie that the game is a gimmick and not a promotional tool as for Poland this will drop away The tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the Finnish lawyers and may fall away after consultation with the Norwegian authorites Jurisdictions where there is a technical risk of violating local laws but a low risk of enforcement Netherlands technically the game violates the Dutch Games of Chance Act DGCA However it is not clear that the DGCA applies to internet games and our Dutch colleagues are not aware of any instances where internet games have been prosecuted under the Act They beleive that even if the Dutch authorites were alerted to the game games offered for a limited period of time for moderate prozes would not be high on teh list of the dutch authorities priorites There is also the issue that Dutch courts probably wont consider themselves to have jurisdiction because for example the prizes are expressed in GBP the game is run from a UK server the language is English and the game does not violate laws in jurisdiction it is run from although no guarantee of this can obviously be given Miscellaneous We await advice from Spain I have received but not yet reviewed the advice from France but from a brief glance it does not look favouarble regarding allowing French citizens to participate I also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether Enron employees themselves can participate this looks favourable obviously as long as the game is conducted fairly I will review the specifics of this advice and forward it to you along with the advice we have on disclaimers I should be able to do this this afternoonevening UK time I have advice from most of the jursidictions on Olympic legislation Would

should be expected There is zero chance of us getting approval to use Sydney Olympic names and images They have already been sold off The use of the Olympic name etc is reserved to partners who have tipped in millions I did a quick check of the net and found that there is already a sweepstakes being run on behalf of these partners It appears that the sweepstakes includes global partners such as IBM and hence there might be restrictions in other jurisdictions on running a game in competition to it The legislation is broadly drafted to pick up any use of Olympic and related terms The Act is additional to normal trademark legislation and is designed to stop unauthorised orgainisations associating themselves with Olympics so as to protect the value of sponsorships Attached is an extract from the legislation listing some but not all of the terms that cant be used engsponsorsgoodsportshtml Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Alan CT John nron Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Dave CT Subject Re EOL Sports Game David and Scott I certainly appreciate your very prompt feedback on this issue I need to clarify one important misconception included in Scotts memorandum The game will be open to all customers on EnronOnline not just Enron employees Enron employees will be permitted to participate although there may be restrictions placed on their ability to win prizes In light of this fact and the information contained in your memorandum I have several follow up questions The game is open without entry fee or charge Does this make a difference under the lottery legislation outlined in the memo or do you believe we will still need to seek a permit If it will be necessary to obtain a permit we would like to proceed as quickly as possible in trying to obtain one With regard to the use of the Sydney Olympics etc names and symbols we would like to proceed as quickly as possible to obtain a license to use the names It is vital that we obtain the right to use these symbols in the promotion and hosting of this game Notwithstanding the issues surrounding use of the trademarked names and symbols referring to the Olympics are there any other restrictions prohibiting the promotion of a game related to the Olympics Regards Leslie David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Leslie CT cc ECT ECT ECT John CT Alan CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Attached is a brief advice I asked outside counsel to prepare They confirm my understanding that a permit would almost certainly be required They also raised another obvious concern There is legislation designed to protect businesses who are not Olympic sponsors cashing on the Olympics Particularly in New South Wales this legislation is being rigorously enforced to the extent possible by the regulators David Minns To Leslie CT cc ECT ECT ECT John CT Alan CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Whilst it appears to be an excellent marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified On what you have told me there are two potential issues My initial view is that sweepstake may be considered a lottery under New South Wales the State where Enron is based gaming laws If this correct then we will need a license I should be able to confirm this later today We will also need to check the other Australian States where we have counterparties There also significant public debate on internet gambling in Australia Recently the Federal Government indicated that it would move to regulate the area The second relates to passing items of value to employees of companies with whom we do business To be frank I am uncomfortable with any arrangement that could result in this occurring unless we had the informed consent of the employer Apart from the negative fallout that may result we are we also need to be mindful that in Australia a number of our counterparties are Government owned utilities This does raise questions as the possible application of the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act On the facts available I could not preclude a circumstance arising that could be viewed as not in compliance with that Act Leslie some further facts will assist How will the offer be made will it just be on the website or will promotional material also be sent Which Enron entity will be making the offer Who can play Will it only be the master user or can anyone with a password play To whom would the prize be given Would it go to the individual or would the prize be given to the company with no possibility of it being intercepted by the individual Japan will also have some issues relating to gaming which I am sure Anne at BM will be able to advise on Do we need to check on the situation in Singapore Sorry to throw up all these problems but this proposal does have some real issues atleast on the facts given in your email Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc John nron Alan CT Subject EOL Sports Game As we have discussed either directly or indirectly EnronOnline is interested in offering an online sweepstakes game to its customers The game will be based upon the Olympic games and is similar in concept to a fantasy football league A participant selects several countries as its team and accumulates points based upon the medals earned by its countries in the Olympic games Unlike fantasy football however there is no entry fee to win and no other form of payment is required from participants Prizes eg big screen tv camcorder will be awarded based upon highest points accumulated I have asked each of you to research any prohibitions on such a game in the following jurisdictions Jim Canada Anne Japan David Australia I need to know if these jurisdictions impose any restrictions on such a game Can we make the game available to all EnronOnline customers in each of these jurisdictions What if any procedures andor requirements must we meet in order to offer the game If we cannot permit certain jurisdictional residents to participate can we still post the game if we include adequate disclaimers The game will be launched during the first week of September so your prompt response will be most appreciated Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter Regards Leslie Hansen

<12199546.1075858587442.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,leslie.hansen@enron.com,2001-08-07 10:07:26,ConfirmLogic Issues Cc ConfirmLogic will revolutionize the current method of confirming power tran sactions While the paperless confirmation process will generate much that is positive it also creates certain legal concerns for the power group Historically the confirmation process has been used by the power group to address contractual inadequacies and ambiguities in product terms Confirm Logic is designed to confirm the basic commercial terms of standard transac tions It is not intended as a vehicle for confirming unique transactions addressing additional contractual terms or clarifying transaction terms Thus we must employ appropriate guidelines to ensure that only standar d power transactions are confirmed via ConfirmLogic and necessary addit ional terms and conditions of confirmation are agreed to with a counterpart y prior to the implementation of ConfirmLogic with such counterparty IConfirmation of Standard Transactions We need to ensure that ConfirmLogic is used to confirm only standard power transactions If a transaction would require a special confirmation templ ate or otherwise include special terms and conditions eg an unusual pro duct such as minute spinning reserve such transaction is not appropria te for confirmation via ConfirmLogic There are a number of steps we could take to help ensure that only appropriate transactions are confirmed by Co nfirmLogic I proposed that EnPower and analogous deal entry systems i nclude a field where the trader designates whether the deal should be confi rmed by ConfirmLogic If the default were No the traders would be requi red to proactively designate if ConfirmLogic could be used Melissa Murphy has indicated that the traders would strongly resist such a process Alte rnatively Melissa and I discussed a twostep process whereby a we create a Special Handling flag for the deal entry system so that if a trader has a trade with special terms and conditions the trade is flagged and will no t flow to ConfirmLogic and b the documentation group runs regular report s throughout the day listing all trades with comments added to the Comment section by the trader and pulls any trades from the ConfirmLogic website that require special handling with the risk of the counterparty accepting the confirmation or automatic matching of the confirmation prior to the tim e the trade is pulled off the web The success of this process would tur n upon adequate education of the traders and consistent monitoring by the d ocumentation group According to Melissa Murphy I believe we could al so code certain products types eg minute spinning reserve so that t hey could not be confirmed by ConfirmLogic As new products were created we would need to decide whether to code the product to allow confirmation b y ConfirmLogic We could build a delay into the ConfirmLogic process t o ensure that the documentation group had time to review the deals flowing to ConfirmLogic before the counterparty can confirm the transaction For i nstance if a deal with special terms was sent through ConfirmLogic the do cumentation group could flag the transaction with the Inquiry status and notify the counterparty that the transaction should be confirmed in writing to memorialize special terms and conditions However CommodityLogic will likely oppose this suggestion because they have marketed ConfirmLogic as real time IIAdditional Terms and Conditions of Confirmation Attached below please find the Form of Agreement Relating to Power Trans actions Confirmed by ConfirmLogic the Confirmation Agreement This is the type of document that we need to finalize with each power counterparty before transactions are confirmed by ConfirmLogic The CommodityLogic webs ite contains private and public folders that may be utilized by Enron to po st the Confirmation Agreement electronically We must be prepared to address changes in product terms and other contra ctual issues with each counterparty using ConfirmLogic Thus we should ma intain a Confirmation Agreement database to track such counterparties We would need to update the Confirmation Agreements as changes to the product terms occur Moreover as we negotiate new master agreements with such cou nterparties we must be aware of the terms of the Confirmation Agreement an d address whether to conform the new master to the Confirmation Agreement o r incorporate the terms of the Confirmation Agreement into the new master a nd thus supersede the Confirmation Agreement While ConfirmLogic will post summaries of EnronOnline transactions Enro nOnline transactions will not be confirmed on ConfirmLogic The ConfirmLog ic documentation makes clear that EOL transactions are posted for informati on purposes only will not be confirmed This is consistent with the direct ion we have been going for all EnronOnline transactions Janet Moore has b een involved in a project to discontinue the confirmation process for all E OL transactions with certain counterparties Enron will enter into agreem ents with certain counterparties whereby the parties agree that EOL tra nsactions need not be confirmed notwithstanding any terms in the underlyin g master agreement to the contrary and to additional terms of the tran saction previously captured by the confirmation process the EOL Agreement If we have already entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty we need not address EOL trades in the Confirmation Agreement However if we have not yet entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty we can address all EOL issues in the Confirmation Agreement itself and thus obviat e the need for two separate agreements I look forward to any questions or suggestions you have relating to the issues raised in this email Thanks Leslie

HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Dave CT Subject Re Enron game Rachel I dont think were going to be interested in reimbursing for connection costs so I think we should

sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules I will forward you that email If you go into the Registration Screen of the demo game you will see that individual participants will be required to enter their name email address and telephone number I look forward to your comments on this issue Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron game Dear Leslie France I have now read through the French advice The DGCCRF lottery regulators have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet communication This means that the game probably does fall foul of French lottery legislation One way round this might be to offer to reimburse connection costs If this is done then there are still a couple of indirect contribution issues to sort out these relate to being seen not to promote Enron and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions although French law on these matters is generally stricter There is also a possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed to adjudicate in the case of disupute but I get the impression from the French advice that this could probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible if it isnt then there is presumably little point in tidying up the indirect contribution and bailiff issues The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded ie there must be an expectation of profitgain Hence in theory not awarding the prize to a French resident should allow the game to be played in France The French lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically I am not sure I understand their concerns and have asked them for clarification I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies together with employees of other Enron Customers for example UK companies who happen to reside in France I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification that such exclusions would suffice and will forward you the essence of their replies I set out below a list of countries where the game would be lawful providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country Netherlands Belgium Sweden France subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns Italy As mentioned in my previous email some of these countries may move into the approved list anyway I have not received express advice on this particular issue from Norway but there advice implies that not awarding prizes would be ok and if the tax issue scan be sorted out Norway may move to the approved list anyway I will however ask them to confirm the not awarding prizes point for completeness I have not received advice on this point from Spain You may recall that for the Euro game colleagues in Belgium were concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents then this needs to be made very clear from an early stage so that Enron are not misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be awarded a prize if they are not going to be If ineligbility for prizes is placed prominently in the rules and partcipants have to read the rules before playing then I guess that this covers this issue Although none of the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point I think it would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an online registration process are Spain based on previous Euro advice Italy Netherlands Denmark Sweden Belgium but note the comments made re Euro that there is a very slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential difficulties ie Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium participants had been properly advised of their

point of view is data protection ie protection of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to trnsfer data I will look into this and let you know As mentioned above the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need to be included in the eligibility section Miscellaneous One issue which was touched upon in a previous email was whether the

jurisdictional matters Please note that Justin and I have determined that because Enron could be exposed to criminal liability in the Netherlands we will exclude residents notwithstanding low risk of prosecution We are awaiting advise re rather the same state of affairs exists in Italy low probability of prosecution but some risk of criminal liability Leslie Forwarded by Leslie HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Subject Re Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Rachel Thank you so much for the feedback I will follow up later this morning to address those questions that have yet to be answered With regard to a summary of your Olympic research in other jurisdictions I would very much appreciate a summary Thanks Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Thank you for your emails I set out below the advice we have received from the various jurisdictions Countries that can be added to the approved list We have now received the advice from Portugal and as with the Euro game the High Five Flag Game does not violate Portugese law because participants do not have to pay to enter and because it is run outside Portugal so you can add Portugal to the list of approved jurisdictions Finland can now also be added to the approved list The game would not be considered a lottery as the players would not pay to enter It should not be considered a restricted marketing measure providing there is no obligation to purchase goods which I understand is the situation Tax issues were also initially a concern ie it was thought that Enron might be liable to pay tax if it awarded a prize to a Finnish citizen However after discussions with the relevant tax authorities this tax issue seems to have fallen away because Enron as a foreign organiser would not have any liabilites towards the Finnish tax office If a Finnish citizen won the prize they themselves might have to pay tax on it but I assume that this is not a concern of Enron since they themselves would not have liability towards the Finnish tax office Countries that could possibly be added to the approved list provided certain facts are confirmed with either Enron or the regulatory authoritesandor further information is provided As with Euro Poland is also looking likely the Polish lawyers require me to confirm that Enrons customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to do so in the future It is my understanding that this is the case so assuming this is correct Poland could be added to the approved list Belgium it is unclear under Belgium law whether the game is a Games of Chance a Lottery or a Contest They need to forward a demo to the regulatory authorities I have not yet checked whether the demo sent yesterday is complete enough our web access was very slow thsi morning but as suggested in your email I will contact Dave Samuels if I need a substantially more complete demo Italy Approval is needed in Italy if the game is an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents The scheme would be classified as an advertising contest the key is whether it is addressed to Italian residents Our Italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will be in Italy and would like us to confirm that the site will be in English and from a server located in the UK In order to obtain approval the Italian lawyers need to know whether Enron has a subsidiary in Italy if it does the application needs to be made on behalf of this company if it doesnt have an Italian subsidiary then they cannot actually apply for approval of the scheme An integral feature of being an advertising contest is that a prize is awarded so if Italian participants are excluded from being awarded a prize the game wont be an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents Sweden The game is a lottery under Swedish law and therefore requires approval which there is virtually no chance of Enron obtaining because it is not a charitable organisation if it is addressed to the Swedish public as a general rule more than people Our Swedish lawyers therefore need to know how many participants there are in Sweden if it is less than then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead but I will confirm this with them Norway There are four issues affecting the game in Norway these are whether the game is a lottery whether the game is a money game whether the game promotes a business and tax issues After informal talks with the relevant ministries th first two issues have fallen away and are now no longer a problem The Norwegian lawyers had some concerns as to whether the purpose of the scheme was to promote Enron but I believe that if I can confirm to them that customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to so in the future ie that the game is a gimmick and not a promotional tool as for Poland this will drop away The tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the Finnish lawyers and may fall away after consultation with the Norwegian authorites Jurisdictions where there is a technical risk of violating local laws but a low risk of enforcement Netherlands technically the game violates the Dutch Games of Chance Act DGCA However it is not clear that the DGCA applies to internet games and our Dutch colleagues are not aware of any instances where internet games have been prosecuted under the Act They beleive that even if the Dutch authorites were alerted to the game games offered for a limited period of time for moderate prozes would not be high on teh list of the dutch authorities priorites There is also the issue that Dutch courts probably wont consider themselves to have jurisdiction because for example the prizes are expressed in GBP the game is run from a UK server the language is English and the game does not violate laws in jurisdiction it is run from although no guarantee of this can obviously be given Miscellaneous We await advice from Spain I have received but not yet reviewed the advice from France but from a brief glance it does not look favouarble regarding allowing French citizens to participate I also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether Enron employees themselves can participate this looks favourable obviously as long as the game is conducted fairly I will review the specifics of this advice and forward it to you along with the advice we have on disclaimers I should be able to do this this afternoonevening UK time I have advice from most of the jursidictions on Olympic legislation Would

will send the demo to Milbank Canadian and Japanese counsel for them to review in conjunction with their research for us From our preliminary advice I believe that we will need to structure the game similar to the format in the demo to avoid liability in various jurisdictions for violating trademark restrictions on the use of the terms Olympics Sydney and the like We will be able to offer the games to most US residents as well as those European residents for which we received the green light during the Euro research We should also be able to offer the game to Japanese residents so long as the prize has a value no greater than yen We will not be able to offer the game to residents of Australia or Singapore see David Minns email below re Australia I am waiting for final word on Canada Leslie Forwarded by Leslie HansenHOUECT on AM David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Leslie CT cc Alan CT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Kirsty HogarthENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game As per my voicemail If Olympic terms are used we will not be protected by disclaimers We are talking multiple permits for the various States I have spoken to our Managing Director and we do not want to invest any more in resources in what would be a huge exercise to get lottery licences for an internet product in each of the States in a matter of days Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re EOL Sports Game David If Australian residents are not permitted to play the game and we make clear disclaimers of such and restrict dissemination of marketing materials to exclude Australian residents can we avoid liability under Australian law If we try to structure the game so that it complies with Australian law it appears that we will still be required to seek a permit to offer a game such as this notwithstanding the Olympics issue in Australia Can you talk to your commercial guys to determine how many Australian EOL CPs we currently have and whether it is worth the expenditure of the resources necessary to obtain a permit to make this game available to those CPs Leslie David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Leslie CT cc Alan CT John nron Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Dave CT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Leslie we need to talk about this asap It is irrelevant whether we are charging to play game The distribution of prizes through chance triggers the requirement for a licence Generally this would not be a problem but as Mallesons observed the licensing of gambling on the internet is major political issue and we should not expect a permit to be granted at an administrative level Hence delays should be expected There is zero chance of us getting approval to use Sydney Olympic names and images They have already been sold off The use of the Olympic name etc is reserved to partners who have tipped in millions I did a quick check of the net and found that there is already a sweepstakes being run on behalf of these partners It appears that the sweepstakes includes global partners such as IBM and hence there might be restrictions in other jurisdictions on running a game in competition to it The legislation is broadly drafted to pick up any use of Olympic and related terms The Act is additional to normal trademark legislation and is designed to stop unauthorised orgainisations associating themselves with Olympics so as to protect the value of sponsorships Attached is an extract from the legislation listing some but not all of the terms that cant be used engsponsorsgoodsportshtml Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Alan CT John nron Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Dave CT Subject Re EOL Sports Game David and Scott I certainly appreciate your very prompt feedback on this issue I need to clarify one important misconception included in Scotts memorandum The game will be open to all customers on EnronOnline not just Enron employees Enron employees will be permitted to participate although there may be restrictions placed on their ability to win prizes In light of this fact and the information contained in your memorandum I have several follow up questions The game is open without entry fee or charge Does this make a difference under the lottery legislation outlined in the memo or do you believe we will still need to seek a permit If it will be necessary to obtain a permit we would like to proceed as quickly as possible in trying to obtain one With regard to the use of the Sydney Olympics etc names and symbols we would like to proceed as quickly as possible to obtain a license to use the names It is vital that we obtain the right to use these symbols in the promotion and hosting of this game Notwithstanding the issues surrounding use of the trademarked names and symbols referring to the Olympics are there any other restrictions prohibiting the promotion of a game related to the Olympics Regards Leslie David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Leslie CT cc ECT ECT ECT John CT Alan CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Attached is a brief advice I asked outside counsel to prepare They confirm my understanding that a permit would almost certainly be required They also raised another obvious concern There is legislation designed to protect businesses who are not Olympic sponsors cashing on the Olympics Particularly in New South Wales this legislation is being rigorously enforced to the extent possible by the regulators David Minns To Leslie CT cc ECT ECT ECT John CT Alan CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Whilst it appears to be an excellent marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified On what you have told me there are two potential issues My initial view is that sweepstake may be considered a lottery under New South Wales the State where Enron is based gaming laws If this correct then we will need a license I should be able to confirm this later today We will also need to check the other Australian States where we have counterparties There also significant public debate on internet gambling in Australia Recently the Federal Government indicated that it would move to regulate the area The second relates to passing items of value to employees of companies with whom we do business To be frank I am uncomfortable with any arrangement that could result in this occurring unless we had the informed consent of the employer Apart from the negative fallout that may result we are we also need to be mindful that in Australia a number of our counterparties are Government owned utilities This does raise questions as the possible application of the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act On the facts available I could not preclude a circumstance arising that could be viewed as not in compliance with that Act Leslie some further facts will assist How will the offer be made will it just be on the website or will promotional material also be sent Which Enron entity will be making the offer Who can play Will it only be the master user or can anyone with a password play To whom would the prize be given Would it go to the individual or would the prize be given to the company with no possibility of it being intercepted by the individual Japan will also have some issues relating to gaming which I am sure Anne at BM will be able to advise on Do we need to check on the situation in Singapore Sorry to throw up all these problems but this proposal does have some real issues atleast on the facts given in your email Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc John nron Alan CT Subject EOL Sports Game As we have discussed either directly or indirectly EnronOnline is interested in offering an online sweepstakes game to its customers The game will be based upon the Olympic games and is similar in concept to a fantasy football league A participant selects several countries as its team and accumulates points based upon the medals earned by its countries in the Olympic games Unlike fantasy football however there is no entry fee to win and no other form of payment is required from participants Prizes eg big screen tv camcorder will be awarded based upon highest points accumulated I have asked each of you to research any prohibitions on such a game in the following jurisdictions Jim Canada Anne Japan David Australia I need to know if these jurisdictions impose any restrictions on such a game Can we make the game available to all EnronOnline customers in each of these jurisdictions What if any procedures andor requirements must we meet in order to offer the game If we cannot permit certain jurisdictional residents to participate can we still post the game if we include adequate disclaimers The game will be launched during the first week of September so your prompt response will be most appreciated Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter Regards Leslie Hansen

HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Dave CT Subject Re Enron game Rachel I dont think were going to be interested in reimbursing for connection costs so I think we should just keep France in the lists of not approved With regard to the data protection issue I have actually sent Justin an email on this various issue to determine if our current legal privacy language is sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules I will forward you that email If you go into the Registration Screen of the demo game you will see that individual participants will be required to enter their name email address and telephone number I look forward to your comments on this issue Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron game Dear Leslie France I have now read through the French advice The DGCCRF lottery regulators have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet communication This means that the game probably does fall foul of French lottery legislation One way round this might be to offer to reimburse connection costs If this is done then there are still a couple of indirect contribution issues to sort out these relate to being seen not to promote Enron and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions although French law on these matters is generally stricter There is also a possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed to adjudicate in the case of disupute but I get the impression from the French advice that this could probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible if it isnt then there is presumably little point in tidying up the indirect contribution and bailiff issues The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded ie there must be an expectation of profitgain Hence in theory not awarding the prize to a French resident should allow the game to be played in France The French lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically I am not sure I understand their concerns and have asked them for clarification I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies together with employees of other Enron Customers for example UK companies who happen to reside in France I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification that such exclusions would suffice and will forward you the essence of their replies I set out below a list of countries where the game would be lawful providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country Netherlands Belgium Sweden France subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns Italy As mentioned in my previous email some of these countries may move into the approved list anyway I have not received express advice on this particular issue from Norway but there advice implies that not awarding prizes would be ok and if the tax issue scan be sorted out Norway may move to the approved list anyway I will however ask them to confirm the not awarding prizes point for completeness I have not received advice on this point from Spain You may recall that for the Euro game colleagues in Belgium were concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents then this needs to be made very clear from an early stage so that Enron are not misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be awarded a prize if they are not going to be If ineligbility for prizes is placed prominently in the rules and partcipants have to read the rules before playing then I guess that this covers this issue Although none of the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point I think it would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an online registration process are Spain based on previous Euro advice Italy Netherlands Denmark Sweden Belgium but note the comments made re Euro that there is a very slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential difficulties ie Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium participants had been properly advised of their ineligibility Belgium law requires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers Rules I have not had chance to review the rules in detail One issue that may be important from a European point of view is data protection ie protection of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to trnsfer data I will look into this and let you know As mentioned above the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need to be included in the eligibility section Miscellaneous One issue which was touched upon in a previous email was whether the word Olympic could be used in a disclaimer I will look into this further and get back to you on this matter next week As requested I will summarize the Olympic advice for you also Regards Rachel This

prosecution We are awaiting advise re rather the same state of affairs exists in Italy low probability of prosecution but some risk of criminal liability Leslie Forwarded by Leslie HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Subject Re Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Rachel Thank you so much for the feedback I will follow up later this morning to address those questions that have yet to be answered With regard to a summary of your Olympic research in other jurisdictions I would very much appreciate a summary Thanks Leslie Murton Rachel AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions Thank you for your emails I set out below the advice we have received from the various jurisdictions Countries that can be added to the approved list We have now received the advice from Portugal and as with the Euro game the High Five Flag Game does not violate Portugese law because participants do not have to pay to enter and because it is run outside Portugal so you can add Portugal to the list of approved jurisdictions Finland can now also be added to the approved list The game would not be considered a lottery as the players would not pay to enter It should not be considered a restricted marketing measure providing there is no obligation to purchase goods which I understand is the situation Tax issues were also initially a concern ie it was thought that Enron might be liable to pay tax if it awarded a prize to a Finnish citizen However after discussions with the relevant tax authorities this tax issue seems to have fallen away because Enron as a foreign organiser would not have any liabilites towards the Finnish tax office If a Finnish citizen won the prize they themselves might have to pay tax on it but I assume that this is not a concern of Enron since they themselves would not have liability towards the Finnish tax office Countries that could possibly be added to the approved list provided certain facts are confirmed with either Enron or the regulatory authoritesandor further information is provided As with Euro Poland is also looking likely the Polish lawyers require me to confirm that Enrons customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to do so in the future It is my understanding that this is the case so assuming this is correct Poland could be added to the approved list Belgium it is unclear under Belgium law whether the game is a Games of Chance a Lottery or a Contest They need to forward a demo to the regulatory authorities I have not yet checked whether the demo sent yesterday is complete enough our web access was very slow thsi morning but as suggested in your email I will contact Dave Samuels if I need a substantially more complete demo Italy Approval is needed in Italy if the game is an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents The scheme would be classified as an advertising contest the key is whether it is addressed to Italian residents Our Italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will be in Italy and would like us to confirm that the site will be in English and from a server located in the UK In order to obtain approval the Italian lawyers need to know whether Enron has a subsidiary in Italy if it does the application needs to be made on behalf of this company if it doesnt have an Italian subsidiary then they cannot actually apply for approval of the scheme An integral feature of being an advertising contest is that a prize is awarded so if Italian participants are excluded from being awarded a prize the game wont be an advertising contest addressed to Italian residents Sweden The game is a lottery under Swedish law and therefore requires approval which there is virtually no chance of Enron obtaining because it is not a charitable organisation if it is addressed to the Swedish public as a general rule more than people Our Swedish lawyers therefore need to know how many participants there are in Sweden if it is less than then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead but I will confirm this with them Norway There are four issues affecting the game in Norway these are whether the game is a lottery whether the game is a money game whether the game promotes a business and tax issues After informal talks with the relevant ministries th first two issues have fallen away and are now no longer a problem The Norwegian lawyers had some concerns as to whether the purpose of the scheme was to promote Enron but I believe that if I can confirm to them that customers are permitted to use Enrons website for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the past and do not intend to so in the future ie that the game is a gimmick and not a promotional tool as for Poland this will drop away The tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the Finnish lawyers and may fall away after consultation with the Norwegian authorites Jurisdictions where there is a technical risk of violating local laws but a low risk of enforcement Netherlands technically the game violates the Dutch Games of Chance Act DGCA However it is not clear that the DGCA applies to internet games and our Dutch colleagues are not aware of any instances where internet games have been prosecuted under the Act They beleive that even if the Dutch authorites were alerted to the game games offered for a limited period of time for moderate prozes would not be high on teh list of the dutch authorities priorites There is also the issue that Dutch courts probably wont consider themselves to have jurisdiction because for example the prizes are expressed in GBP the game is run from a UK server the language is English and the game does not violate laws in jurisdiction it is run from although no guarantee of this can obviously be given Miscellaneous We await advice from Spain I have received but not yet reviewed the advice from France but from a brief glance it does not look favouarble regarding allowing French citizens to participate I also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether Enron employees themselves can participate this looks favourable obviously as long as the game is conducted fairly I will review the specifics of this advice and forward it to you along with the advice we have on disclaimers I should be able to do this this afternoonevening UK time I have advice from most of the jursidictions on Olympic legislation Would

Game Leslie we need to talk about this asap It is irrelevant whether we are charging to play game The distribution of prizes through chance triggers the requirement for a licence Generally this would not be a problem but as Mallesons observed the licensing of gambling on the internet is major political issue and we should not expect a permit to be granted at an administrative level Hence delays should be expected There is zero chance of us getting approval to use Sydney Olympic names and images They have already been sold off The use of the Olympic name etc is reserved to partners who have tipped in millions I did a quick check of the net and found that there is already a sweepstakes being run on behalf of these partners It appears that the sweepstakes includes global partners such as IBM and hence there might be restrictions in other jurisdictions on running a game in competition to it The legislation is broadly drafted to pick up any use of Olympic and related terms The Act is additional to normal trademark legislation and is designed to stop unauthorised orgainisations associating themselves with Olympics so as to protect the value of sponsorships Attached is an extract

proceed as quickly as possible in trying to obtain one With regard to the use of the Sydney Olympics etc names and symbols we would like to proceed as quickly as possible to obtain a license to use

QuilkeyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EOL Sports Game Whilst it appears to be an excellent marketing strategy the caution displayed in researching the law in various jurisdictions is justified On what you have told me there are two potential issues My initial view is that sweepstake may be considered a lottery under New South Wales the State where Enron is based gaming laws If this correct then we will need a license I should be able to confirm this later today We will also need to check the other Australian States where we have counterparties There also significant public debate on internet gambling in Australia Recently the Federal Government indicated that it would move to regulate the area The second relates to passing items of value to employees of companies with whom we do business To be frank I am uncomfortable with any arrangement that could result in this occurring unless we had the informed consent of the employer Apart from the negative fallout that may result we are we also need to be mindful that in Australia a number of our counterparties are Government owned utilities This does raise questions as the possible application of the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act On the facts available I could not preclude a circumstance arising that could be viewed as not in compliance with that Act Leslie some further facts will assist How will the offer be made will it just be on the website or will promotional material also be sent Which Enron entity will be making the offer Who can play Will it only be the master user or can anyone with a password play To whom would the prize be given Would it go to the individual or would the prize be given to the company with no possibility of it being intercepted by the individual Japan will also have some issues relating to gaming which I am sure Anne at BM will be able to advise on Do we need to check on the situation in Singapore Sorry to throw up all these problems but this proposal does have some real issues atleast on the facts given in your email Leslie CT To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc John nron Alan CT Subject EOL Sports Game As we have discussed either directly or indirectly EnronOnline is interested in offering an online sweepstakes game to its customers The game will be based upon the Olympic games and is similar in concept to a fantasy football league A participant selects several countries as its team and accumulates points based upon the medals earned by its countries in the Olympic games Unlike fantasy football however there is no entry fee to win and no other form of payment is required from participants Prizes eg big screen tv camcorder will be awarded based upon highest points accumulated I have asked each of you to research any prohibitions on such a game in the following jurisdictions Jim Canada Anne Japan David Australia I need to know if these jurisdictions impose any restrictions on such a game Can we make the game available to all EnronOnline customers in each of these jurisdictions What if any procedures andor requirements must we meet in order to offer the game If we cannot permit certain jurisdictional residents to
