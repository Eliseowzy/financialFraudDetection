retail issues need to be addressed by a single entity I have not heard any compelling arguments otherwise Jeff Stanley NRON AM Sent by Cindy NRON To Jeff ES cc Subject Re FW Strawman Jeff FYIany comments Stan Stanley Horton AM Sent by Cindy Stark To Mucci Ron M RonM illiamscom cc Subject Re FW Strawman Ron The proposal in my opinion is cumbersome and duplicative and fails to understand the convergence issues However I have felt that the Producer and LDC segments would not support the EISB concept if it meant the demise of GISB I think I could support the compromise and wait for the ultimate evolution to occur Stan Mucci Ron M RonM illiamscom on AM To cc Subject FW Strawman Stan Please see the attached email which summarizes our last strawman conference call I wanted to point out where each of the participants was coming from by separate email Hugh Roberts and Alan Knoop who were attending a producer meeting were adamantly opposed to the models offered by both Greg Lander and Jim Templeton They did not want any structure which would diminish their rights and took the position that both were nonstarters The same was also true of Mike Novak who spoke for the LDCs Hugh offered a third model which kept both gas and electric essentially separate with what he termed a Energy Standards Advisory Communication Liaison as the interface between GISB and EISB Electric Industry Standards Board My concern was this did not go far enough to assure that cross industry issues would be addressed To bridge the gap we elevated the bridge to an Executive Committee level with representation from both gas and electric with a charter to review only those issues which cut across both industries Personally I view this as an evolutionary process to get all segments comfortable with the mechanics of dealing with cross industry issues If we push for a combined Board the votes from the Producers and LDCs are not there Maybe the EC level is a good start We have another conference call this Thursday I would appreciate your thoughtsreaction to this hybrid strawman recognizing that we have not discussed any details Pending the outcome of this weeks call with Jim Greg and Rae hopefully in attendance I will let you know where things stand If we are still on this track after the call I would like to have a follow up conference call with the Pipeline segment to get everyone up to speed Ron Original Message From Mucci Ron M Sent Monday July AM To Cc Subject Strawman The following are the meeting notes from our conference call last Thursday to discuss the various models for the new industry standards organization In attendance for the conference call were Hugh Roberts Mike Novak Alan Knoop and Ron Mucci Although invited Rae McQuade Jim Templeton and Greg Lander were unable to attend We began the meeting by reviewing three strawman proposals that had been offered to date by Jim Templeton Greg Lander Hugh Roberts After making sure we understood each proposal the discussion focused on overarching needsrequirements that each sector representative felt was essential regardless of the specific framework The following were identified and supported by all parties Each sector currently represented within the GISB organization should not have any degradation in rightsrepresentation with respect to gas issues There was a general concern that electric issues would overshadow the agendaresourcesfunding of any joint organization In addition there was general agreement that it didnt make sense for representatives of the gas industry to vote on issues which solely impacted the electric industry and visa versa The electric sector should be free to develop whatever framework best meets their needs to establish standards Simply stated the gas sector should not dictate what works best for the electric sector nor should any solution which works best for their industry be imposed on the gas side of the equation For example GISB currently has within its charter the ability to address both retail and wholesale standards within their existing framework If the electric industry desires a bifurcated organization to address retail and wholesale standards for example then they should be free to do so without forcing the gas industry to make a similar split With this general understanding of where each segment was coming from we began reviewing the various strawman proposals to see which fit these needs best or whether some hybrid solution was more appropriate In summary the team concluded the following The model offered by Greg Lander simply carried the combined structure too far down with the risk of the gas representatives within any of the five energy industry segments being overshadowed Simply stated there was a concern shared by all that the first requirement articulated above would not be met under this structure The model offered by Jim Templeton while keeping the work at the detailed level separate had the same potential risk of dilution in terms of gas representation and each sectors voting rights now being five out of fifty The model offered by Hugh Roberts preserved the respective rights of each segment represented in the gas industry but did not go far enough to assure that issues which impacted by gas and electric would be properly addressed Therefore the participants crafted a hybrid option which can best be described by analogy to Congress If you view gas issues as being similar to legislation which is introduced and drafted into law by the House or Senate if you like and electric issues as those introduced and drafted into law by the Senate or House if you like then a Conference Committee would be established to address only those issues which impact both Otherwise issues that only effect gas are voted on by the House eg GISB and only those that impact electric are voted on by the Senate eg Electric Industry Standards Board In effect what the group devised was a body in the middle at the Executive Committee level to resolve cross industry issues which would then be taken back to the respective organizations for approval and implementation While the specific voting rights rules etc where not fleshed out in the conference call everyone felt that we should be given the opportunity to think over this general framework and run it by our respective segments before any further meat was put on the bone To that end the team would appreciate it if each member was given the opportunity to visit with their segment rather than having the proposal posted by GISB and communicated to the world Truly this is a work in progress and does not necessary reflect the opinion of all segments within GISB especially in light of the fact that Greg and Jim were not in attendance However it is a start and does reflect something which we all felt met the needs articulated at the beginning of the call To that end another call has been scheduled for the Thursday Any comments corrections clarifications etc are more than welcome As a final note all agreed that this model was not necessarily and end state but a beginning and that this process was evolutionary I hope that a properly capture the discussion and I look forward to next Thursdays call at pm CST Ron
