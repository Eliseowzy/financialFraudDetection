together in any form of written communication We must be very careful going down this path Your comment below is very valid Having said that we can certainly help facilitate putting together an agreement with the understanding that I will not put my people through a fire drill We need total buy in from all the parties GSS has already wasted a lot of time on this process Let us know the next step and Glenn and I will be happy to help with the agreement Cheers Peter L Goebel Director Sourcing Portfolio Leader IT Utilities Global Strategic Sourcing Work Cell Jeff Youngflesh AM To Jennifer nron Peter nron cc Glenn NRON Subject Product Quotes and Software License Agreement BMC EBS info Jennifer and Peter welcome back Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the proposals to EBS and Net Works etc from BMC I am curious Peter or Glenn if it is reasonable of BMC to make the statement to the effect that the discount is applied only if we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place Is that cutting it close on the restraint of trade issue Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people Matson Cumming choose the BMC product at testing conclusion he would support their decision Smith and Ogg have given no go indications I have received that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation but Jim Oggs lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar conclusion for his situation BMC and EBS both I believe are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this deal It is my understanding Peter that the timing of that request might be a problem for your guysPerhaps we should have a quick informal powwow about this Thanks Jeff Forwarded by Jeff YoungfleshNAEnron on AM Stephen NRON COMMUNICATIONS PM To Jeff

nron Communications Subject Product Quotes and Software License Agreement Hi Steve It was nice talking to you Included here are the Product quotes that we sent to the groups The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for Bruce Smiths projects Real Media is for Everett The other two are self explanatory The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg and therefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal were doing together That is significant because it effects discounts volume and certainly the more BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal As mentioned in the phone call Ill send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp which includes EBS software license agreement with BMC if I can get it for you Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today It includes the terms of liability warranty etc I look forward to seeing you today Best regards Ann Enron RealMedia KM Order xls Enron Doug Cummins teamxls Enron Randy Matson teamxls Enron INCONTROL

on the way to the Enron BroadbandBMC agreement since we last spoke Apparently it is extremely important to Jim Crowder to get this agreement in place by December As a result of the conversation between Jim Crowder and Jeff Hawn BMC Exec I have been directed to help Steve Morse and Chaz Vaughan in leveraging the best deal possible for the various projects that Enron is considering with BMC As you are aware we have already proposed several individual deals In addition to those we are including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to you The purpose of this email is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price more attractive to Enron We would very much appreciate your help in expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure
