cohen alice bonder linda berman Subject Lets see if you send this back Lets see if you send this back One day when I was a freshman in high school I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school His name was Kyle It looked like he was carrying all of his books I thought to myself Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday He must really be a nerd I had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so I shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking I saw a bunch of kids running toward him They ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt His glasses went flying and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes My heart went out to him So I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses and I saw a tear in his eye As I handed him his glasses I said Those guys are jerks They really should get lives He looked at me and said Hey thanks There was a big smile on his face It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude I helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived As it turned out he lived near me so I asked him why I had never seen him before He said he had gone to private school before now I would have never hung out with a private school kid before We talked all the way home and I carried some of his books He turned out to be a pretty cool kid I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends He said yes We hung out all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle the more I liked him and my friends thought the same of him Monday morning came and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again I stopped him and said Boy you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday He just laughed and handed me half the books Over the next four years Kyle and I became best friends When we were seniors we began to think about college Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke I knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem He was going to be a doctor and I was going for business on a football scholarship Kyle was valedictorian of our class I teased him all the time about being a nerd He had to prepare a speech for graduation I was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak Graduation day I saw Kyle He looked great He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school He filled out and actually looked good in glasses He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous Today was one of those days I could see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked him on the back and said Hey big guy youll be great He looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled Thanks he said As he started his speech he cleared his throat and began Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years Your parents your teachers your siblings maybe a coachbut mostly your friends I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them I am going to tell you a story I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met He had planned to kill himself over the weekend He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldnt have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile Thankfully I was saved My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile Not until that moment did I realize its depth Never underestimate the power of your actions With one small gesture you can change a persons life For better or for worse God puts us all in each others lives to
