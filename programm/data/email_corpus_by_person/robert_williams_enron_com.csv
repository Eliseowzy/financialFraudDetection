we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration Michelle Blaine PM To cc John nron Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard B CT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Cuiaba Calllegal issues Consent Issue Jose Bestard hes the main developer who did this deal reported that he met with Furnas this week Furnas had not received EPEs letter addressing the consent issue Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE There are initials on the original consent and no one including Furnas knows whose they are John Novak told me hes not sure of the significance but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents Nevertheless we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor Electronorte Arbitration considerations Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador He consulted Enrons financialbusiness consultant in Brazil Winston Fernino sp who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration What concerns me however is his advice that politically it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent that there is a political battle in the senate and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance My view on that is to wait more weeks to progress with this notice of default when the day cure period has expired plus the day extension which has also expired sends the wrong message and weakens our position Thus it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause paragraph of the PPA which then requires a day consultation period paragraph at the end of which we have the option to terminate This buys us a little time but keeps the pressure on at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate Im not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas Im not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet I am not sure what rights if any we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation something we need to look at under the contract although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard I committed that we would advise the team on the next call next Thursday our recommendation with respect to arbitrationlitigation I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that or handle that your own way Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative Ill find out who represents them Force Majeure Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim Based on my reading of the contract our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause c However Im told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms Well need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney generals action Laine Powell President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position Note that if FM lasts more than consecutive months both parties have the right to terminate No one buys the plant and were stuck Ill find out the date of our last FM notice There have been several Budget Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and the cost of the arbitration Darren Ill call you tomorrow and we can break that out We may want to consider the litigation route Well need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it Ive done this with Pete before and he seems to like it It needs to be subject to review as we go along NEXT Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place Im going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice We certainly have some conflicting views Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway If we go to court perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate that is what Fernando Serec said Who knows Please give me your comments or just call me Im open to any suggestions John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan Regards Michelle

we are considering Brazilian court versus ICC arbitration Michelle Blaine PM To cc John nron Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard B CT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Cuiaba Calllegal issues Consent Issue Jose Bestard hes the main developer who did this deal reported that he met with Furnas this week Furnas had not received EPEs letter addressing the consent issue Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE There are initials on the original consent and no one including Furnas knows whose they are John Novak told me hes not sure of the significance but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents Nevertheless we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor Electronorte Arbitration considerations Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador He consulted Enrons financialbusiness consultant in Brazil Winston Fernino sp who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration What concerns me however is his advice that politically it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent that there is a political battle in the senate and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance My view on that is to wait more weeks to progress with this notice of default when the day cure period has expired plus the day extension which has also expired sends the wrong message and weakens our position Thus it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause paragraph of the PPA which then requires a day consultation period
