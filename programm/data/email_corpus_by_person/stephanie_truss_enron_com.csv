Tuesday March AM To Lundstrom Bruce Brownfeld Gail Cc Kraske Paul Subject Protected by AttorneyClient Relationship Privileged Information MPCB Importance High Sensitivity Confidential Bruce and Gail Root Cause Analysis Attached please find the root cause analysis which describes the series of events since the naphtha spill on March The original of these documents are being couriered to Bruce Lundstroms attention by DHL courier today and should arrive in about business days time We are also sending drawingsplans of the various equipment involved with the accidental discharge which could not be scanned Memorandum regarding the Phase II fuel filter skids Attached please find a memo which includes a description of Alan Stringers and Ramus evaluation of the amount of naphtha that may have been spilled at the DPC site Legal opinions Last Thursday March nd the DPC legal team determined that we needed to obtained outside counsel opinion on whether DPC has an obligation to disclose the discharge of naphtha at the DPC site as a result of an mechanical failure in the Phase II Fuel Skids and which were in use for Phase I activities The same day Atul Setalvad and Atul Rajadhyaksha were contacted for their opinions in the matter Atul Setalvad was unavailable until Tuesday March and Atul Rajadhyaksha was not available on Friday Saturday or Sunday but agreed to give an interim note Atul R provided us with an interim note but it did not comprehensively cover the laws and rules that the DPC team considered applicable in the matter and to which he agreed to provide supplemental information on Monday March th upon his return from travelling to visit his ill father On Monday Atul R met in the DPC office on Monday at pm at which time he was provided the facts as they were known at that time by the DPC legal team He sent his revised note today Today we spoke with Atul Setalvad in his chambers and he render a preliminary opinion in hand writing that will be supplemented by a written opinion by Monday April Both Atul Setalvad and Atul Radjadhyaksha have each provided an opinionnote on their views of whether DPC has an obligation to notify MPCB of the March th discharge of naphtha at the DPC site Resoundingly each have urged immediate notification to MPCB of the discharge Attached you will find their opinionnote In brief Atul Setalvads opinion was based on pragmatic considerations and on his preliminary view of the law Essentially he argues the following MPCB will eventually learn about the discharge at the site due to the fact that at least workers who cleaned up the discharge live in the nearby villages and it will be communicated until the matter is brought to MPCBs attention It is improbable that MPCB will react rationally when they learn of the discharge If DPC needs to seek recourse to judicial intervention for redress of an MPCB action then the court is not likely to treat DPC favorably if DPC failed to give notice of the discharge Finally Atul Setalvad initially thinks DPC is obliged under the Environmental Protection Act to provide notice as he thinks the discharge is clearly covered by the general provision section of the law zero tolerance and even if one took the broader view also under the rules major accident Atul Rajadhyaksha gave a long opinion but essentially concluded that DPC needs to notify He thinks that if DPC doesnt notify then it will have the onus in a court of law to prove that it didnt have the obligation which would be very difficult under the circumstances MPCB visit MPCB will visit the site on Wednesday March th to measure the smoke stacks at the power blocks and to look into other matters which do not appear to include any activities near or about the area where the naphtha spill occurred Piyush Joshi will accompany the MPCB personnel and the MSEB personnel who will be visiting the site together with appropriate DPC personnel It is anticipated that he could be asked questions that may be sensitive in nature so the Public Relations department has prepared a list of questions and answers for DPC personnel to answer in relation to the MPCB visit or for the press in the event of notification being sent to MPCB Your views on these QAs would be appreciated please bear in mind that we may be asked questions about the incident Environmental auditor visit Currently Alan Stringer an Enron Europe employee is at the DPC site at the request of Bruce Lundstrom and he is conducting due diligence and preparatory work for an environmental audit and risk management plan for remediation of the discharge His report is not attached to this email as it was mailed separately to Bruce on Saturday March Pursuant to Alan Stringers brief at least one independent environmental auditor not an Enron employee will arrive at the site on Friday March to take ground water samples and soil samples and return to the UK since thereafter for further evaluation of the same OPIC visit An environmental person from OPIC has long been scheduled for a visit to the DPC site on Thursday March and on Friday March It is expected that at least two persons from the State Bank of India will accompany the OPIC representative to the site While the site is very large there is the possibility that these persons could observe AFCONS reassembling the drilling equipment in preparation of making new bore wells OPIC may require specific notification of environmental events that occur at the DPC site pursuant to its loan documents with DPC An initial review of these documents does not reveal this requirement though certainly the Common Agreement has a general obligation of the same nature to notify the lenders of environmental events that could have a material adverse effect The Common Agreement provides that such notification must come days after an event such as notification to MPCB It would not be advisable to notify the lenders but not notify MPCB of this event as the lenders would be curious as to our reasoning for such a nondisclosure to MPCB DPC legal team position The DPC Legal team recommends that notice be provided immediately to MPCB which is in accordance with the position taken by outside local counsel for DPC It is further recommended that this notice be provided to MPCB by the monthly report submitted by DPC to MPCB in which a description of the event will serve as notification While there may be other state bodies that could be required under the law to be notified it is our view that notice to MPCB should be sufficient for meeting our most immediate obligations under the relevant environment laws At such time that it is determined that notice may be required under other acts of law such notice may be provided to those concerned authorities Timing and form of notification The DPC commercial team thinks that notification to MPCB should be given immediately by Wednesday The form of the notification is recommended to be in the monthly MPCB report that DPC submit on or about the first of each month to MPCB It is being suggested by Ken Lambert at the site that the notice should be held ready to be delivered but not actually delivered until after MPCBs visit is completed on Wednesday He is curious to see if MPCB clears the problem with the measurement of the smoke stacks This is a strategic call and a view could be taken that if MPCB appears to be ready to review the area of the naphtha spill then a telephone call could be made to DPC in Mumbai and the monthly report or other notification could be sent immediately via fax to MPCB in Mumbai and if necessary hand delivered to MPCB officials at the site In any event notification should go in as soon as possible on Wednesday Attached please find a form of that monthly report Spill Report for your review which with your approval will form the basis of our notification to MPCB on Wednesday March I just received this draft from Mr Mitra at that site so no one has given me any comments yet Yours are welcomed before Wednesday morning IST In the event that it is not recommended by Houston management to send notification in the monthly report please find attached a form
