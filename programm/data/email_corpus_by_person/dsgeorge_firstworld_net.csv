SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills Probe of California Power Prices Begins but New Plants Arent Seen as Solution Sept Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting Surprisingly From Deregulation Sept California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs Sept If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some point you have a financial crisis The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The California utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility that serves one out of every Americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by billion It is borrowing million while Edison is tapping million from the commercial paper market This is going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief financial officer for Southern California Edison Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March which opened electricity pricing to competition California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system To do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By the end of this June PGE and Edison together had collected more than billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March deadline set by the legislature At that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE that analysts expect its deficit to exceed billion by Oct more than half its shareholder equity of billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of billion The utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of they get clobbered That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds could total million while in Edisons case the amount is million Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock The utility serving that city San Diego Gas Electric Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers Legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors corporate ratings group But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare Californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds Nevertheless several forces are working against them Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need If they dont buy enough the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison though is one of timing The California legislature is out of session until December and regulators havent even really started to address the issue formally In the meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily Write to Rebecca Smith at

Investors Bet on Utilities Bonds By GREGORY ZUCKERMAN and JATHON SAPSFORD Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL As lights go out in California on Wall Street light bulbs are popping over the heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis Amid the rolling blackouts investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcylaw protection The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets and political importance that a solution will be found that will include gains for intrepid bondholders But some experts advise investors to be careful wading into the energy current saying it could be a while before the bonds pay off And they are emphatic that the companies stocks should be avoided like a downed electrical pole Over the past few weeks the debt of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison has been downgraded to junk status by leading rating agencies and both utilities have missed debt payments usually a huge red flag for investors Meanwhile holders of the utilities commercial paper which is the shortestterm debt are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings though it is getting hard to find takers But the unsecured longerterm debt of both companies has remained in demand trading at around cents on the dollar at least cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks moving from cents on the dollar to about cents though the move has come on limited volume Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman of MJ Whitman Were trying to buy the secured bonds like its going out of style and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt says Mr Whitman who runs Third Avenue Value Fund a mutual fund as well as hedge funds Mr Whitman whose firm also acts as a brokerdealer for distressed debt hopes to buy as much as million of the bonds in coming weeks His only frustration is that the prices arent coming down The numbercrunching by investors works along these lines At current prices for unsecured bonds investors could score gains of to annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years the average bankruptcycourt stay For secured bonds paid off within that period the gain would be almost annually With quicker payoffs the return jumps of course The two utilities have more than billion in debt outstanding of which just a small fraction is insured Why do the bulls including distresseddebt specialists as well as funds such as Mr Whitmans see so much value in the utility mess Unlike the runofthemill troubled company the utilities are so big and so important to the California economy that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments bulls say Theyre too big and important not to get a solution says Todd Thompson a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management If a theater company or retailer goes away no one cares but here there has to be a resolution Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies such as Public Service of New Hampshire which was under bankruptcycourt protection in to and never missed a bond payment If theres a liquidation or if they figure this out youre going to get paid back principal payments and accrued interest Mr Whitman says Adds Marc Lasry managing director of Amroc Investments a leading investor and trader in distressed debt Theres been quite a lot of buying because at the end of the day youll get paid The question is how long it will take But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines hoping to dump their positions once a resolution becomes more evident Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems A bankruptcycourt filing would raise further uncertainty perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electricrate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings Moreover resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on Even as Mr Whitman and others place their new bets many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities debt figuring it was rock solid are licking their wounds We stayed away from tobacco We stayed away from Japanese banks says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach who invested million in Edisons commercial paper before the creditratings agencies downgraded the utilities debt With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr Moorlach wouldnt touch he says Its frustrating Mr Moorlach as fate would have it was the man appointed in to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis one brought on by bad investments He improved Orange Countys finances by prudent investments including securities issued by utilities This is survivable he says of his current quandary but its just awkward Others say the commercialpaper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses at least in the near term One reason There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper because these shortterm securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors Both utilities commercial paper is being quoted for about cents on the dollar With little being traded its very hard to get rid of it right now says Sean Egan managing director at EganJones Ratings Co who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms Things might get worse While the commercialpaper holders might eventually get at least some of their money back some fear those payments wont come soon enough to prevent some moneymarket mutual funds from seeing the value of their shares break the buck or drop below the pershare level causing losses for supposedly sound investments Such an event however would be rare in the moneymarket world As for the utilities stock if there is a reorganization of the companies it could wipe out at least some shareholder value while bondholders could gain control of the remaining equity Youre taking huge risks on the stock says Mr Whitman PGE shares have dropped sharply over the past few months falling from a high of about in late summer At pm Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading they were up cents to Edison meanwhile was up cents to on the Big Board down from more than in the summer Yet as steep as the declines have been the shares of both utilities still trade higher than is typical for stocks of companies facing the possibility of bankruptcy The stock price is irrational Amrocs Mr Lasry says Write to Gregory Zuckerman at and Jathon Sapsford at

could threaten continued growth of vital industries such as technology Some Wall Street economists worry that Californias problems could spill over and hurt the broader US economy In a report titled California Unplugged A Drag on Global Growth Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns that Californias energy crisis threatens to push up production costs and make US exports from the state which totaled billion in less competitive on world markets Negatives tend to snowball so what is happening in California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we already are seeing in the US economy says Joseph Quinlan a Morgan Stanley economist Other states facing economic and financial trouble wouldnt warrant such attention But California not only is the nations largest state in terms of both population and economic heft but the Golden State also seemed to epitomize the New Economy Job growth in the state has been double that in the nation as a whole of the million jobs created in the US during the first months of last year one of every five new hires was in California The state produced more than trillion in output in making it the sixthlargest economy in the world slightly smaller

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Its a market ripe for manipulation surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition This is the state of the US electricity business in the summer of And sure enough theres growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system at consumers expense The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers arent supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever See related article Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation On July wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit per megawatt hour That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp and PPL Corp the old Philadelphia Electric Co and Pennsylvania Power Light made the most of steamy conditions In the regions power market deregulated in a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of generating plants The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmissioninterconnection points for the month of May from to TRANSMISSIONINTERCONNECTION POINT CHANGE Texas LouisianaMississippiArkansas Tennessee Valley Authority CaliforniaOregon border New YorkWest Chicago area New England New YorkEast Upper Midwest Florida MidAtlantic region Includes only years Source Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation theres a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency FERC which polices the nations bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in It wasnt supposed to be this way In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players some affiliated with utilities some not to build power plants and sell electricity Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers At the same time utilities are surrendering control of longhaul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid the multistate system of high voltage lines Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another But the massive US energy infrastructure wasnt designed to serve as the backbone of a free market On hot summer days when theres little or no surplus electricity in the nations most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident theyll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again Aug Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England July PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets July Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enrons Net Income Jump July PGE Posts Rise in Net to Million July The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation But as nongovernmental organizations they wont have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself A Strange Drop Sometimes its difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market In July engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late s After a lengthy investigation NERC determined that Cinergy Corp a utility holding company had surreptitiously taken enough power over a threeday period about megawatt hours to light a small city for a month Cincinnatibased Cinergy had underestimated power demands Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasnt so high James E Rogers Cinergys chief executive received a letter from AR Garfield the chairman of NERCs regional powercoordination center accusing his company of showing blatant disregard for the rules and of using the grid as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system But Cinergy paid no fine Thats because it runs its own transmission control area and is trusted to enforce NERCs voluntary rules even when it is the violator Smaller utilities in Cinergys area by contrast face contractual penalties of as much as per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid a practice known as leaning on the ties Dancing on the Edge Mr Garfield is still steamed about Cinergys actions which he said removed part of the systems essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it he asks Mr Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies We were very careful to make sure when we leaned on the ties we didnt bring the whole system down he says Nevertheless he concedes in a competitive world those rules need to be changed The regions regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge borrowers for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the countrys transmission system a vast web of connections that resembles the nations highway system before the construction of the interstates While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities there are relatively few routes

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Its a market ripe for manipulation surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition This is the state of the US electricity business in the summer of And sure enough theres growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system at consumers expense The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers arent supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever See related article Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation On July wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit per megawatt hour That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp and PPL Corp the old Philadelphia Electric Co and Pennsylvania Power Light made the most of steamy conditions In the regions power market deregulated in a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of generating plants The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmissioninterconnection points for the month of May from to TRANSMISSIONINTERCONNECTION POINT CHANGE Texas LouisianaMississippiArkansas Tennessee Valley Authority CaliforniaOregon border New YorkWest Chicago area New England New YorkEast Upper Midwest Florida MidAtlantic region Includes only years Source Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation theres a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency FERC which polices the nations bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in It wasnt supposed to be this way In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players some affiliated with utilities some not to build power plants and sell electricity Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers At the same time utilities are surrendering control of longhaul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid the multistate system of high voltage lines Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another But the massive US energy infrastructure wasnt designed to serve as the backbone of a free market On hot summer days when theres little or no surplus electricity in the nations most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident theyll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again Aug Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England July PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets July Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enrons Net Income Jump July PGE Posts Rise in Net to Million July The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation But as nongovernmental organizations they wont have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself A Strange Drop Sometimes its difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market In July engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late s After a lengthy investigation NERC determined that Cinergy Corp a utility holding company had surreptitiously taken enough power over a threeday period about megawatt hours to light a small city for a month Cincinnatibased Cinergy had underestimated power demands Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasnt so high James E Rogers Cinergys chief executive received a letter from AR Garfield the chairman of NERCs regional powercoordination center accusing his company of showing blatant disregard for the rules and of using the grid as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system But Cinergy paid no fine Thats because it runs its own transmission control area and is trusted to enforce NERCs voluntary rules even when it is the violator Smaller utilities in Cinergys area by contrast face contractual penalties of as much as per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid a practice known as leaning on the ties Dancing on the Edge Mr Garfield is still steamed about Cinergys actions which he said removed part of the systems essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it he asks Mr Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies We were very careful to make sure when we leaned on the ties we didnt bring the whole system down he says Nevertheless he concedes in a competitive world those rules need to be changed The regions regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge borrowers for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the countrys transmission system a vast web of connections that resembles the nations highway system before the construction of the interstates While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities there are relatively few routes

heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis Amid the rolling blackouts investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcylaw protection The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets and political importance that a

downgraded to junk status by leading rating agencies and both utilities have missed debt payments usually a huge red flag for investors Meanwhile holders of the utilities commercial paper which is the shortestterm debt are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings though it is getting hard to find takers But the unsecured longerterm debt of both companies has remained in demand trading at around cents on the dollar at least cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks moving from cents on the dollar to about cents though the move has come on limited volume Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman of MJ Whitman Were trying to buy the secured bonds like its going out of style and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt says Mr Whitman who runs Third Avenue Value Fund a mutual fund as well as hedge funds Mr Whitman whose firm also acts as a brokerdealer for distressed debt hopes to buy as much as million of the bonds in coming weeks His only frustration is that the prices arent coming down The numbercrunching by investors works along these lines At current prices for unsecured bonds investors could score gains of to annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years the average bankruptcycourt stay For secured bonds paid off within that period the gain would be almost annually With quicker payoffs the return jumps of course The two utilities have more than billion in debt outstanding of which just a small fraction is insured Why do the bulls including distresseddebt specialists as well as funds such as Mr Whitmans see so much value in the utility mess Unlike the runofthemill troubled company the utilities are so big and so important to the California economy that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments bulls say Theyre too big and important not to get a solution says Todd Thompson a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management If a theater company or retailer goes away no one cares but here there has to be a resolution Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies such as Public Service of New Hampshire which was under bankruptcycourt protection in to and never missed a bond payment If theres a liquidation or if they figure this out youre going to get paid back principal payments and accrued interest Mr Whitman says Adds Marc Lasry managing director of Amroc Investments a leading investor and trader in distressed debt Theres been quite a lot of buying because at the end of the day youll get paid The question is how long it will take But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines hoping to dump their positions once a resolution becomes more evident Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems A bankruptcycourt filing would raise further uncertainty perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electricrate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings Moreover resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on Even as Mr Whitman and others place their new bets many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities debt figuring it was rock solid are licking their wounds We stayed away from tobacco We stayed away from Japanese banks says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach who invested million in Edisons commercial paper before the creditratings agencies downgraded the utilities debt With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr Moorlach wouldnt touch he says Its frustrating Mr Moorlach as fate would have it was the man appointed in to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis one brought on by bad investments He improved Orange Countys finances by prudent investments including securities issued by utilities This is survivable he says of his current quandary but its just awkward Others say the commercialpaper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses at least in the near term One reason There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper because these shortterm securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors Both utilities commercial paper is being quoted for about cents on the dollar With little being traded its very hard to get rid of it right now says Sean Egan managing director at EganJones Ratings Co who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms Things might get worse While the commercialpaper holders might eventually get at least some of their money back some fear those payments wont come soon enough to prevent some moneymarket mutual funds from seeing the value of their shares break the buck or drop below the pershare level causing losses for supposedly sound investments Such an event however would be rare in the moneymarket world As for the utilities stock if there is a reorganization of the companies it could wipe out at least some shareholder value while bondholders could gain control of the remaining equity Youre taking huge risks on the stock says Mr Whitman PGE shares have dropped sharply over the past few months falling from a high of about in late summer At pm Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading they were up cents to Edison meanwhile was up cents to on the Big Board down from more than in the summer Yet as steep as the declines have been the shares of both utilities still trade higher than is typical for stocks of companies facing the possibility of bankruptcy The stock price is irrational Amrocs Mr Lasry says Write to Gregory Zuckerman at and Jathon Sapsford at

Investors Bet on Utilities Bonds By GREGORY ZUCKERMAN and JATHON SAPSFORD Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL As lights go out in California on Wall Street light bulbs are popping over the heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis Amid the rolling blackouts investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcylaw protection The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets and political importance that a solution will be found that will include gains for intrepid bondholders But some experts advise investors to be careful wading into the energy current saying it could be a while before the bonds pay off And they are emphatic that the companies stocks should be avoided like a downed electrical pole Over the past few weeks the debt of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison has been downgraded to junk status by leading rating agencies and both utilities have missed debt payments usually a huge red flag for investors Meanwhile holders of the utilities commercial paper which is the shortestterm debt are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings though it is getting hard to find takers But the unsecured longerterm debt of both companies has remained in demand trading at around cents on the dollar at least cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks moving from cents on the dollar to about cents though the move has come on limited volume Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman of MJ Whitman Were trying to buy the secured bonds like its going out of style and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt says Mr Whitman who runs Third Avenue Value Fund a mutual fund as well as hedge funds Mr Whitman whose firm also acts as a brokerdealer for distressed debt hopes to buy as much as million of the bonds in coming weeks His only frustration is that the prices arent coming down The numbercrunching by investors works along these lines At current prices for unsecured bonds investors could score gains of to annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years the average bankruptcycourt stay For secured bonds paid off within that period the gain would be almost annually With quicker payoffs the return jumps of course The two utilities have more than billion in debt outstanding of which just a small fraction is insured Why do the bulls including distresseddebt specialists as well as funds such as Mr Whitmans see so much value in the utility mess Unlike the runofthemill troubled company the utilities are so big and so important to the California economy that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments bulls say Theyre too big and important not to get a solution says Todd Thompson a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management If a theater company or retailer goes away no one cares but here there has to be a resolution Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies such as Public Service of New Hampshire which was under bankruptcycourt protection in to and never missed a bond payment If theres a liquidation or if they figure this out youre going to get paid back principal payments and accrued interest Mr Whitman says Adds Marc Lasry managing director of Amroc Investments a leading investor and trader in distressed debt Theres been quite a lot of buying because at the end of the day youll get paid The question is how long it will take But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines hoping to dump their positions once a resolution becomes more evident Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems A bankruptcycourt filing would raise further uncertainty perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electricrate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings Moreover resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on Even as Mr Whitman and others place their new bets many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities debt figuring it was rock solid are licking their wounds We stayed away from tobacco We stayed away from Japanese banks says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach who invested million in Edisons commercial paper before the creditratings agencies downgraded the utilities debt With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr Moorlach wouldnt touch he says Its frustrating Mr Moorlach as fate would have it was the man appointed in to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis one brought on by bad investments He improved Orange Countys finances by prudent investments including securities issued by utilities This is survivable he says of his current quandary but its just awkward Others say the commercialpaper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses at least in the near term One reason There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper because these shortterm securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors Both utilities commercial paper is being quoted for about cents on the dollar With little being traded its very hard to get rid of it right now says Sean Egan managing director at EganJones Ratings Co who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms Things might get worse While the commercialpaper holders might eventually get at least some of their money back some fear those payments wont come soon enough to prevent some moneymarket mutual funds from seeing the value of their shares break the buck or drop below the pershare level causing losses for supposedly sound investments Such an event however would be rare in the moneymarket world As for the utilities stock if there is a reorganization of the companies it could wipe out at least some shareholder value while bondholders could gain control of the remaining equity Youre taking huge risks on the stock says Mr Whitman PGE shares have dropped sharply over the past few months falling from a high of about in late summer At pm Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading they were up cents to Edison meanwhile was up cents to on the Big Board down from more than in the summer Yet as steep as the declines have been the shares of both utilities still trade higher than is typical for stocks of companies facing the possibility of bankruptcy The stock price is irrational Amrocs Mr Lasry says Write to Gregory Zuckerman at and Jathon Sapsford at

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Its a market ripe for manipulation surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition This is the state of the US electricity business in the summer of And sure enough theres growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system at consumers expense The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers arent supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever See related article Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation On July wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit per megawatt hour That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp and PPL Corp the old Philadelphia Electric Co and Pennsylvania Power Light made the most of steamy conditions In the regions power market deregulated in a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of generating plants The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmissioninterconnection points for the month of May from to TRANSMISSIONINTERCONNECTION POINT CHANGE Texas LouisianaMississippiArkansas Tennessee Valley Authority CaliforniaOregon border New YorkWest Chicago area New England New YorkEast Upper Midwest Florida MidAtlantic region Includes only years Source Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation theres a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency FERC which polices the nations bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in It wasnt supposed to be this way In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players some affiliated with utilities some not to build power plants and sell electricity Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers At the same time utilities are surrendering control of longhaul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid the multistate system of high voltage lines Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another But the massive US energy infrastructure wasnt designed to serve as the backbone of a free market On hot summer days when theres little or no surplus electricity in the nations most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident theyll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again Aug Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England July PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets July Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enrons Net Income Jump July PGE Posts Rise in Net to Million July The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation But as nongovernmental organizations they wont have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself A Strange Drop Sometimes its difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market In July engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late s After a lengthy investigation NERC determined that Cinergy Corp a utility holding company had surreptitiously taken enough power over a threeday period about megawatt hours to light a small city for a month Cincinnatibased Cinergy had underestimated power demands Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasnt so high James E Rogers Cinergys chief executive received a letter from AR Garfield the chairman of NERCs regional powercoordination center accusing his company of showing blatant disregard for the rules and of using the grid as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system But Cinergy paid no fine Thats because it runs its own transmission control area and is trusted to enforce NERCs voluntary rules even when it is the violator Smaller utilities in Cinergys area by contrast face contractual penalties of as much as per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid a practice known as leaning on the ties Dancing on the Edge Mr Garfield is still steamed about Cinergys actions which he said removed part of the systems essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it he asks Mr Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies We were very careful to make sure when we leaned on the ties we didnt bring the whole system down he says Nevertheless he concedes in a competitive world those rules need to be changed The regions regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge borrowers for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the countrys transmission system a vast web of connections that resembles the nations highway system before the construction of the interstates While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities there are relatively few routes connecting regions That makes it possible for some big companies to shut out competitors A Snag in Transmission St Louisbased Aquila Energy hit that snag when it tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New Orleansbased Entergy Corp to move electricity to a buyer in East Texas Entergy granted the request initially but then it canceled saying it didnt have sufficient space on its lines Aquila didnt buy it After analyzing transmissioncapacity data the company argued to FERC that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so was in effect breaking a rule that required it to provide transmissionline access when possible Without access to Entergys lines Aquila was forced to compensate the buyer and lost nearly on the deal From whom did the Texas customer end up buying the power A unit of Entergy and for a higher price than it would have paid Aquila FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to restrict access in this case because it had transmission problems But FERC found that Entergy on other occasions had hoarded transmission capacity that should have been made available to the market Entergy declines to comment Such scenarios are costly for consumers and they are among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying flush times In the second quarter just ended companies ranging from AES Corp in Arlington Va to Enron Corp in Houston reported huge profit increases some as much as To be sure a lot of those profits are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a pickup in energy trading But Sean Murphy president of Southern Energy New England a unit of Southern Cos Atlanta Ga worries that the industry has gotten too greedy and risks retribution Pigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered he says Tremendous Volatility New federal data show that average wholesale power prices have more than doubled at of key pricing points across the country in the past three years By May of this year prices had risen across a broad range by in Florida for example and by in Texas But even these increases mask the tremendous volatility that has struck all the major wholesale markets during the past year In the case of the Midwest where prices in July hit per megawatt hour it was as if a gallon of gas suddenly sold for Prices like these have prompted growing calls for investigations into whether electric companies are gouging their customers Some consumer groups lukewarm to deregulation in the first place now are agitating for reregulation Residential electricity bills have doubled in San Diego which is notable because its the first city in the nation to be served by a utility thats buying all of its energy on the competitive market Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific Northwest There wholesale prices peaked at a record per megawatt hour during the last week in June Energyintensive industries like mines and aluminum smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily laying off workers We may be seeing too much opportunism in the market says Montana Gov Marc Racicot Demands by Mr Racicot and his counterpart in Washington Gary Locke were instrumental in prompting FERC to open a national investigation in late July into possible market abuses A SixMonth Lag One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a free flow of information will let markets police themselves and operate efficiently But a key tool for market monitoring the data on utility Web sites used to book transmission orders is often unreliable Theres a sixmonth lag on the release of bidding data which are coded to mask the identities of bidders Whats more the four FERCcontrolled ISOs operating in California the Middle Atlantic states New England and New York dont have the authority to compel market participants to give them internal documents like bilateral contracts and other information they dont want to hand over Without such documents theres a lot more looking than finding says Bill Museler chief executive of the New York ISO Even if the ISOs do find something problematic there isnt much they can do about it The tariffs contracts and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit them from releasing companyspecific data and so exposing wrongdoers And with the exception of California the ISOs own board meetings are closed to the public The reality is confidentiality rules protect the guilty says Frank Wolak a professor of economics at Stanford University and chairman of the California ISOs Market Surveillance Committee And there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of fair play That can be a huge problem on hot days In California an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in which it tries to match the next days anticipated demand to bids by generators But this summer generators often have offered less power than they know will be needed so that they can submit higher bids later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for emergency power On occasion ISO engineers have had just minutes to frantically phone around and nail down suppliers knowing that if they fail they could be forced to begin rolling blackouts The bidding strategy while legal undermines reliability and forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics says Kellan Fluckiger chief operations officer for the California ISO Generators say they arent to blame for the mad scramble Utilities buying power for their customers often order less power than they really need for fear that a big order will drive up the overall market price to prohibitive levels The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to rewrite the rules governing their local markets But FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because generators are investing billions of dollars based on existing market rules Theres another reason too says Ron Rattey a veteran FERC economist who in June wrote a page internal memo criticizing the agency for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct Every single ISO has identified strategic abuses he says And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules the market participants find new ways around them Write to Rebecca Smith at and John J Fialka at

Investors Bet on Utilities Bonds By GREGORY ZUCKERMAN and JATHON SAPSFORD Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL As lights go out in California on Wall Street light bulbs are popping over the heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis Amid the rolling blackouts investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcylaw protection The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets and political importance that a solution will be found that will include gains for intrepid bondholders But some experts advise investors to be careful wading into the energy current saying it could be a while before the bonds pay off And they are emphatic that the companies stocks should be avoided like a downed electrical pole Over the past few weeks the debt of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison has been downgraded to junk status by leading rating agencies and both utilities have missed debt payments usually a huge red flag for investors Meanwhile holders of the utilities commercial paper which is the shortestterm debt are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings though it is getting hard to find takers But the unsecured longerterm debt of both companies has remained in demand trading at around cents on the dollar at least cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks moving from cents on the dollar to about cents though the move has come on limited volume Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman of MJ Whitman Were trying to buy the secured bonds like its going out of style and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt says Mr Whitman who runs Third Avenue Value Fund a mutual fund as well as hedge funds Mr Whitman whose firm also acts as a brokerdealer for distressed debt hopes to buy as much as million of the bonds in coming weeks His only frustration is that the prices arent coming down The numbercrunching by investors works along these lines At current prices for unsecured bonds investors could score gains of to annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years the average bankruptcycourt stay For secured bonds paid off within that period the gain would be almost annually With quicker payoffs the return jumps of course The two utilities have more than billion in debt outstanding of which just a small fraction is insured Why do the bulls including distresseddebt specialists as well as funds such as Mr Whitmans see so much value in the utility mess Unlike the runofthemill troubled company the utilities are so big and so important to the California economy that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments bulls say Theyre too big and important not to get a solution says Todd Thompson a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management If a theater company or retailer goes away no one cares but here there has to be a resolution Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies such as Public Service of New Hampshire which was under bankruptcycourt protection in to and never missed a bond payment If theres a liquidation or if they figure this out youre going to get paid back principal payments and accrued interest Mr Whitman says Adds Marc Lasry managing director of Amroc Investments a leading investor and trader in distressed debt Theres been quite a lot of buying because at the end of the day youll get paid The question is how long it will take But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines hoping to dump their positions once a resolution becomes more evident Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems A bankruptcycourt filing would raise further uncertainty perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electricrate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings Moreover resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on Even as Mr Whitman and others place their new bets many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities debt figuring it was rock solid are licking their wounds We stayed away from tobacco We stayed away from Japanese banks says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach who invested million in Edisons commercial paper before the creditratings agencies downgraded the utilities debt With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr Moorlach wouldnt touch he says Its frustrating Mr Moorlach as fate would have it was the man appointed in to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis one brought on by bad investments He improved Orange Countys finances by prudent investments including securities issued by utilities This is survivable he says of his current quandary but its just awkward Others say the commercialpaper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses at least in the near term One reason There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper because these shortterm securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors Both utilities commercial paper is being quoted for about cents on the dollar With little being traded its very hard to get rid of it right now says Sean Egan managing director at EganJones Ratings Co who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms Things might get worse While the commercialpaper holders might eventually

SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills Probe of California Power Prices Begins but New Plants Arent Seen as Solution Sept Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting Surprisingly From Deregulation Sept California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs Sept If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some point you have a financial crisis The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The California utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility that serves one out of every Americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by billion It is borrowing million while Edison is tapping million from the commercial paper market This is going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief financial officer for Southern California Edison Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March which opened electricity pricing to competition California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system To do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By the end of this June PGE and Edison together had collected more than billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March deadline set by the legislature At that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE that analysts expect its deficit to exceed billion by Oct more than half its shareholder equity of billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of billion The utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of they get clobbered That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds could total million while in Edisons case the amount is million Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock The utility serving that city San Diego Gas Electric Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers Legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors corporate ratings group But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare Californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds Nevertheless several forces are working against them Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need If they dont buy enough the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison though is one of timing The California legislature is out of session until December and regulators havent even really started to address the issue formally In the meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily Write to Rebecca Smith at

Investors Bet on Utilities Bonds By GREGORY ZUCKERMAN and JATHON SAPSFORD Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL As lights go out in California on Wall Street light bulbs are popping over the heads of investors hoping to profit from the electricity crisis Amid the rolling blackouts investors with a taste for risk are betting on the bonds of the two struggling utilities units of PGE Corp and Edison International even as they move precariously close to filing for bankruptcylaw protection The investors are gambling that the companies have enough assets and political importance that a solution will be found that will include gains for intrepid bondholders But some experts advise investors to be careful wading into the energy current saying it could be a while before the bonds pay off And they are emphatic that the companies stocks should be avoided like a downed electrical pole Over the past few weeks the debt of Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison has been downgraded to junk status by leading rating agencies and both utilities have missed debt payments usually a huge red flag for investors Meanwhile holders of the utilities commercial paper which is the shortestterm debt are doing everything they can do to dump their holdings though it is getting hard to find takers But the unsecured longerterm debt of both companies has remained in demand trading at around cents on the dollar at least cents higher than such debt usually trades at when a company veers so close to a bankruptcy filing Prices of bonds that are secured by the utilities plants have actually edged higher in recent weeks moving from cents on the dollar to about cents though the move has come on limited volume Behind such movements are aggressive investors such as money manager Martin Whitman of MJ Whitman Were trying to buy the secured bonds like its going out of style and some of our smartest clients are buying the unsecured debt says Mr Whitman who runs Third Avenue Value Fund a mutual fund as well as hedge funds Mr Whitman whose firm also acts as a brokerdealer for distressed debt hopes to buy as much as million of the bonds in coming weeks His only frustration is that the prices arent coming down The numbercrunching by investors works along these lines At current prices for unsecured bonds investors could score gains of to annually if principal and interest payments are made within the next two to three years the average bankruptcycourt stay For secured bonds paid off within that period the gain would be almost annually With quicker payoffs the return jumps of course The two utilities have more than billion in debt outstanding of which just a small fraction is insured Why do the bulls including distresseddebt specialists as well as funds such as Mr Whitmans see so much value in the utility mess Unlike the runofthemill troubled company the utilities are so big and so important to the California economy that some form of resolution will likely be found to help them get back on their feet perhaps by allowing the companies to boost electric rates Even if a bankruptcy proceeding results the utilities control sufficient assets to give bondholders a good chance of full recovery of their principal and even eventual payment of any missed interest payments bulls say Theyre too big and important not to get a solution says Todd Thompson a portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management If a theater company or retailer goes away no one cares but here there has to be a resolution Bond specialists also point to their past home runs betting on debt of troubled utility companies such as Public Service of New Hampshire which was under bankruptcycourt protection in to and never missed a bond payment If theres a liquidation or if they figure this out youre going to get paid back principal payments and accrued interest Mr Whitman says Adds Marc Lasry managing director of Amroc Investments a leading investor and trader in distressed debt Theres been quite a lot of buying because at the end of the day youll get paid The question is how long it will take But some caution that the bonds could see weakness in weeks ahead because some debtholders who want to sell are waiting on the sidelines hoping to dump their positions once a resolution becomes more evident Others caution that the California situation is unlike past utility fiascos where savvy investors made out quite well The problem in California is a newly deregulated pricing system that has fallen apart not the overzealous expansion plans that created various earlier problems A bankruptcycourt filing would raise further uncertainty perhaps causing more debt to come up for sale Creditors fear consumer advocates could lobby against an electricrate increase that many say is necessary to solve the crisis and cover payments to creditors these advocates may demand that creditors suffer at least some loss in the value of their holdings Moreover resolution of the matter could take much longer than the two to three years that some investors are banking on Even as Mr Whitman and others place their new bets many investors who months or even years ago bought the utilities debt figuring it was rock solid are licking their wounds We stayed away from tobacco We stayed away from Japanese banks says Orange Country Treasurer John Moorlach who invested million in Edisons commercial paper before the creditratings agencies downgraded the utilities debt With the two California utilities now rated below other investments that Mr Moorlach wouldnt touch he says Its frustrating Mr Moorlach as fate would have it was the man appointed in to help lift Orange County out of its own financial crisis one brought on by bad investments He improved Orange Countys finances by prudent investments including securities issued by utilities This is survivable he says of his current quandary but its just awkward Others say the commercialpaper market is one area where investors could suffer further losses at least in the near term One reason There are few potential buyers for tainted commercial paper because these shortterm securities issued by corporations generally appeal only to ultraconservative investors Both utilities commercial paper is being quoted for about cents on the dollar With little being traded its very hard to get rid of it right now says Sean Egan managing director at EganJones Ratings Co who says those reluctant to bid include Wall Street securities firms Things might get worse While the commercialpaper holders might eventually get at least some of their money back some fear those payments wont come soon enough to prevent some moneymarket mutual funds from seeing the value of their shares break the buck or drop below the

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Its a market ripe for manipulation surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition This is the state of the US electricity business in the summer of And sure enough theres growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system at consumers expense The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers arent supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever See related article Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation On July wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit per megawatt hour That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp and PPL Corp the old Philadelphia Electric Co and Pennsylvania Power Light made the most of steamy conditions In the regions power market deregulated in a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of generating plants The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmissioninterconnection points for the month of May from to TRANSMISSIONINTERCONNECTION POINT CHANGE Texas LouisianaMississippiArkansas Tennessee Valley Authority CaliforniaOregon border New YorkWest Chicago area New England New YorkEast Upper Midwest Florida MidAtlantic region Includes only years Source Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation theres a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency FERC which polices the nations bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in It wasnt supposed to be this way In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players some affiliated with utilities some not to build power plants and sell electricity Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers At the same time utilities are surrendering control of longhaul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid the multistate system of high voltage lines Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another But the massive US energy infrastructure wasnt designed to serve as the backbone of a free market On hot summer days when theres little or no surplus electricity in the nations most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident theyll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again Aug Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England July PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets July Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enrons Net Income Jump July PGE Posts Rise in Net to Million July The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation But as nongovernmental organizations they wont have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself A Strange Drop Sometimes its difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market In July engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation They contacted the North American Electric Reliability

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Its a market ripe for manipulation surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition This is the state of the US electricity business in the summer of And sure enough theres growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system at consumers expense The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers arent supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever See related article Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation On July wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit per megawatt hour That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp and PPL Corp the old Philadelphia Electric Co and Pennsylvania Power Light made the most of steamy conditions In the regions power market deregulated in a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of generating plants The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmissioninterconnection points for the month of May from to TRANSMISSIONINTERCONNECTION POINT CHANGE Texas LouisianaMississippiArkansas Tennessee Valley Authority CaliforniaOregon border New YorkWest Chicago area New England New YorkEast Upper Midwest Florida MidAtlantic region Includes only years Source Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation theres a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency FERC which polices the nations bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in It wasnt supposed to be this way In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players some affiliated with utilities some not to build power plants and sell electricity Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers At the same time utilities are surrendering control of longhaul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid the multistate system of high voltage lines Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another But the massive US energy infrastructure wasnt designed to serve as the backbone of a free market On hot summer days when theres little or no surplus electricity in the nations most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident theyll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again Aug Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England July PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets July Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enrons Net Income Jump July PGE Posts Rise in Net to Million July The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation But as nongovernmental organizations they wont have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself A Strange Drop Sometimes its difficult to know what constitutes an abuse

SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills Probe of California Power Prices Begins but New Plants Arent Seen as Solution Sept Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting Surprisingly From Deregulation Sept California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs Sept If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some point you have a financial crisis The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The California utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility that serves one out of every Americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by billion It is borrowing million while Edison is tapping million from the commercial paper market This is going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief financial officer for Southern California Edison Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March which opened electricity pricing to competition California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system To do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By the end of this June PGE and Edison together had collected more than billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March deadline set by the legislature At that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE that analysts expect its deficit to exceed billion by Oct more than half its shareholder equity of billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of billion The utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of they get clobbered That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds could total million while in Edisons case the amount is million Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock The utility serving that city San Diego Gas Electric Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers Legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors corporate ratings group But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare Californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds Nevertheless several forces are working against them Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need If they dont buy enough the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison though is one of timing The California legislature is out of session until December and regulators havent even really
