Oxley David Cc Redmond Brian Subject FW ENRON STOCK OPTIONS OF HPL EMPLOYEES I dont know how I got this but I presume this is being dealt with by your team Original Message From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESlbechterhoffaepEcom NRONcom Sent Thursday July AM To Brown Aaron Executive Comp Jones Robert W HR Exec Kitchen Louise Subject ENRON STOCK OPTIONS OF HPL EMPLOYEES Gentlemen Attached below are copies of some correspondence between Fran Mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from Enron due to the sale of Houston Pipe Line to AEP Apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such casesthe norm seems to be three years However employees who were able to participate in the original allemployee stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year It seems that employees who joined Enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree but were allowed a threeyear period in the case of involuntary termination Following are the facts material to this issue Fran Mays was represented to HPL employees as the authoritative source of information regarding Enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of HPL Even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative Enron source It is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation In an instance of a divestiture merger or other change of control of a company in my personal experience there can be and often are modifications and exceptions to benefit plans Usually this is done in the interest of fairness to employees affected In my own case in the sale of HPL there was an exception made since I did not retire from Enron but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired This allowed me to be vested in some stock options that I would have lost The monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since I only had about unvested share options but it is a precedent I submitted to Fran Mays through my supervisor a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period The only response to the specific written question that I submitted was contained in a general QA format response from Fran Mays which contains an unequivocal direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of HPL is three years There was a disclaimer in the QA document that referenced plan documents A disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct clear unequivocal statement of fact There is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact I among a number of HPL employees who are former Enron employees made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the QA that we had three years to exercise all options The one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences Although I recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options in my case the combined impact could be very significant From AEPs perspective Enron employees who agreed to stay with HPL and move to AEP with the sale added a great deal of value to the HPL acquisition It seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited Enron I am requesting that the time to exercise the original allemployee options be extended to three years This would make this stock option plan consistent with other Enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to HPL employees that the period would be three years This change would allow HPL employees who acted as loyal Enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted Enron to feel that they were treated fairly by Enron L B Echterhoff From Fran L nronXgate on PM To Lal CT cc Brian NRON Subject RE STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS Lal thanks for your comments I have verified with the Corporate Compensation group and Legal and unfortunately Enron is not able to remedy this situation The plan document provisions supercede the QA Fran Original Message From Echterhoff Lal Sent Thursday May AM To Mayes Fran L Cc Brian NRON Subject Re STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS Your position that the general disclaimer on the QA of March negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable If the answer to this specific question shown below was that various plans had various periods for exercise then that should have been the answer to the question not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years I and I am sure many others made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity I would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant I use the term expiration date to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with Enron With regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger spin off or sale of a company Special provisions were made to exclude HPL employees from the new all employee stock option plan special provisions were made to provide a payment to HPL employees in lieu of the new stock option plan special provisions were made to consider HPL employees over the age of and with more that years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and I feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees Lal Echterhoff From March QA With the transfer to AEP will my termination be listed as involuntary so that I can exercise my vested options Yes your transfer to AEP will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from Enron What is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options The period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination retirement death or disability is three years From Fran L nronXgate on PM Subject STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS We have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options The QA dated March stated three years as the exercise date for options However on page of the document a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program If you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration not three years as stated in question of the document this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document Some employees have options granted under a DIFFERENT stock option plan and that plan carries a three year term of expiration Please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under Additionally the document was intended to provide general information only Page included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case there were any errors made in the document Additionally we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review Enron provides the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document I apologize for any confusion this may have caused however the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which Enron determines the termination date Please call me if you need to discuss your options however understand that I cannot speak with you regarding other employees compensationoptions

difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown but in days we will have everything nailed down Additionally people it would appear seem to be making certain assumptions about the e state which I believe are false I cant see the estate continuing to spons or green cards or in maintaining the cash balance plan at least in the fo rm of the past etc etc Bankruptcy isnt pleasant I would however like to avoid selling NETCO at the estates expense as di fficult as this may be The main points we need to communicate and build around would be Salary Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels Job responsibility This is entirely Jay and Jennys call If they see a p erson as necessary to do a different job they need to explain that Typica lly people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr ent have that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them Clearly NE TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron prebankruptcy Unfortunately that is lost forever Bonus Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr ons current arrangement if we perform Retention Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the people in NETCO who didnt get anything in Nov This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com mitment for them to stay for months or so otherwise they will have to rep ay it Benefits These will differ depending on who buys us However it each cas e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different On the sp ecific point of pension plan they have plans that require some vesting per iod but again the main counter parties have agreed that they will take En ron service into account ie if they have years with Enron and their pl an requires years service to vest they will vest immediately but obvious ly will get just their first years contribution Now is someone is years in with Enron I recognise this is not a great answer but has to be contr asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them ie is the re a job for another months The last point concentrates too much on ne gative aspects of what may happen to estate so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here VISAs we have a plan to switch all Hb visas within hours This is a pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l ogistics with one of the counterparties in some detail On Ls these wil l take up to weeks to switch to Hs Of the people identified who hav e VISAs only about or have Ls Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou nterparties who have agreed our approach These people should avoid travel ing outside US in this weeks but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit Green Cards No easy solution Essentially these will have to start from s cratch The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil l support new applications However bear in mind I do not believe the Enro n estate will continue with green cards although this has not been officia lly proclaimed Expat Terms These will probably be honored by the new company although e ach counterparty has indicated a desire to normalise the terms with thos e of their own company over time Employment Agreements We have identified across NETCO The estate pla ns to transfer these to the buyer but it is clear that each prospective bu yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan w ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements that indi viduals may have had Specifically I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity cash retention target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts Clearly there may be some negotiation her e Now we have other things like Titles PRC Promotion dates Salary review s project bonuses All employee stock option programs etc to figure out but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises after al l the new employer will be probably one of the biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last years There may even be an ability to transfer after a while to a different part of their organisation if they have an internal postin g process As to process from here we want to identify those who DONT want to go and why I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an offer to switch and NOT accepti ng it As I mention above many of the terms of the offer are unlikely to be a huge surprise and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t hem out now for someone who does want to go We should have acceptance not because of bullying or ultimatums but because we figure out early wh o had concerns solving them or switching them out for someone else JeanieAmyMichelleNeil looks like we need new updated talking points fo r all Lets get them out Weds David Original Message From Curless Amanda Sent Sunday December PM To Oxley David Davies Neil Cashion Tana Slone Jeanie Subject RE I am getting heat from IT Importance High David I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zh iyong Wei two senior IT guys had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldnt be better to stay on the Estate My whole purpose in discus sing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings However it seems that some of this miscommunication was and has become an exager ration I attended Beth Perlmans floor meeting when she communciated the differenc e between the Estate and Netco She said that Jay Webb would be talking wit h everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be ta lking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate She did te ll the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a prob lem with this then they should talk with her and HR She also said upon dea l closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation She urged them to please talk with us no w if there are any concerns She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries to bridge service and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure In addition she communicated that we have limited informa tion but we would update the group when more became available It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas etc I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is th at we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until dea l closure I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital a nd will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are they are not guranteed same benefits salary bonus etc and they fe el like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and they are on visas and in the green card process and dont want to start the process over because they dont have enough time left on their visa I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with s ome options I have talked with the concerned employees about what we reque sted but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to corre ct this miscommunication Please keep me updated if you hear anything else Thanks Mandy Original Message From Oxley David Sent Fri PM To Davies Neil Cashion Tana Slone Jeanie Curless

them it broke up boredom of drive between me picking up vo icemails here and what is actually transpiring it sounds like we a miscom munication mess in IT People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told they had no choice but to go and if they didnt they would lose there visa etc etc This was not our intention clearly We I thought made it clear that we wo uld initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate bu t wed like to talk with them about why If its VISAs we have that nailed they shouldnt be concerned If its getting offered a lower paid job t hat simply isnt in the plans of the NETCO transaction unless Beth Jay an d Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction cant think why they would Bottomline people will transfer to a SOLVENT Aplus credit rated company on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to The benefits will switch but we already know that counter parties ben efits are fairly generous even by our standards and they will agree to bri dge service for vesting in pension et al Bonus plan should be very good c urrent proposals are slightly better than Enrons Titles promotions sto ck awards and base pay raises we arent sure about just yet but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherw ise On retention we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those p eople who didnt receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for th is to be paid to employees in the form of a cash retentionbonus payment on or as soon after deal closure as we can As you guys know these dollars approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if Enron was solvent Help me manage this please David

ToDelainey David Olson Cindy Oxley David SubjectFW PRC Process Original Message From Humphrey Gene SentWednesday September PM ToLay Kenneth Whalley Greg Frevert Mark SubjectPRC Process I have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards that a good review process should I hope you will consider my thoughts ca refully since I have had active involvement in the process from its incepti on and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing to the employee being reviewed Even those that do well are suspicious of the process and dont particularly like it It causes a great deal of stre ss on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that should be supportive of it There is a belief that the process is arbitra ry and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rathe r the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative succes s of any particular reviewer The biggest single complaint seems to be the fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are ex cellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse While the employees performance may have suffered during that period of ti me the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance ha s declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not as good as they were six months earlier We are mixing the message betwee n the worth of the individual and the results of their performance The fo llowing is my recommendation to improve on this system SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES Employee Skill Competency and Character This category measures a persons inherent skill talent intelligence and commitments to Enrons va lues This determinant should not change drastically between each review p eriod since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change s lowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better qualified employees In this category a person could be told whether they are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunit y to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires This parti cular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hirin g and training program Employee Performance This a measure of how well an employee is per forming the tasks of any particular job This measure could fluctuate much more than the first since each persons performance can vary greatly over time based on many different circumstances This measure would also distin guish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are outstanding performers It should also help identify those who are under performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first ca tegory This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of p eople since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform abov e and beyond their own capability Results This is a measure of the financial performance and result of the effort of any individual employee I believe this criteria is most suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining fact or but not the only on in annual bonus payments This should be closely correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since s ome people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at som e future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by bein g in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it with out the appropriate effort In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descri ptions that are included in the PRC process I think it is a waste of time to include clerks assistants accounting personnel and other non manager commercial support people in the process Very little is gained by them o r by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and on ly focus on the first two performance categories at that time I would als o change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the s ummer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end wh en there is so much other business activity going on I think a March Sep tember schedule would work much better There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am sure that you are working on them Please give my ideas some thought and s ee if they dont merit some consideration
