SubjectSecurity Update Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world Som e of the changes took effect immediately eg additional security personne l and some are phasing in While not all of the changes will be visible there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities In all th e steps we take and recommendations we make we will be making our faciliti es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi ty while doing our best to minimize disruption to our daytoday business Primary responsibility for Enron Corp Security resides in our business con trols organization You can contact this organization through their websit e security by phone or by email mailto John B rindle Senior Director Business Controls leads this organization Pleas e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions or to report security threats We have two areas to update you on changes in the access procedures for t he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days the following access control procedures will be ins tituted at the Enron Center and other facilities where practical As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identif ication Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca rd Adult visitors without a valid photo ID US drivers license US o r foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identifica tion will not be allowed access to the Enron Center Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b adged contractor at all times Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo yee or badged contractor signed into a visitors log at the lobby receptio n area by the employee or badged contractor and escorted to their appointm ent At the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor the visitor badge collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines report suspicious activity to Secu rity phone do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y ou or hold doors open allowing tail gating by others These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit uted at Enron We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi pment we expect the inconvenience to decrease We hope you understand the se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes we have two important recommenda tions While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security recommend s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided We continue to str ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan Yemen Pak istan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Geo rgia and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled In addition we recommend that planned travel to Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank Jordan Lebanon Saudi Ara bia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate securit y recommends that you carry documentation There have been several recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in the United States being question ed and asked for documentation when boarding US domestic flights As a re sult we suggest that all nonUS citizens who currently reside in the Uni ted States and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status carry th eir passport Form I and Form I at all times We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure It appears that Immi gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National ity Act that requires individuals over the age of to carry hisher regi stration documentation with them at all times This can include a Permanen t Resident Card Form I card Employment Authorization Card Border Cros sing Card or a Temporary Resident Card Immigration Officials have not his torically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c urrent lawful status We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor ate Security website and by email as appropriate
