effect as would an injection during the recent storage allocations For example If the storage fields had a net injection on a given day of dthphysical maximumand at the am cycle an injection increased by dth it would be denied because of the physical limitations The same limitation would occur if a withdraw was reduced by dth creating a net dth injection at the am process because the same physical limitation existing Injections Withdrawals Net physical limitation Trying to reduce a redraw of dth would create Injections Withdrawals Net physically above the limitation and would be allocated The intraday process are interative that is FDD withdrawalsinjections can impact the interruptible storage availability during the intraday cycles whereas the am process is only a individual trueup and not interative with the other storage agreements Lynn and Chris would gladly schedule some time to help clarify these issues and I am sure it will be a lot more informative than my attempt here Original Message From Jeff Hicken mailto Sent Friday November AM To Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Semin Frank Subject RE Zone Allocations It may be standard practice in your opinion but Kelly Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us Also EntergyKoch was completely surprised by it as well We just cant understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection Wed like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better We pulled looked at the am process instructions on the web and it doesnt say anything about this What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldnt do what we thought we had a right to do even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination On top of that no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the gas day if we hadnt been lucky enough to have found it on our own We pushed the gas across to ANR but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated but you cant do it at am It just doesnt make any sense to us Sebesta Chris AM Jeff I am sorry WPL and IES are experiencing allocation problems It is standard procedure during a storage injection allocation the am true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage injections Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their business Other than getting truer information on your markets needs or finding alternate markets for your excess capacity I dont have any other ideas on how to address your zone allocations As requested I will add this item to our December meeting agenda Original Message From Jeff Hicken mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Subject Re Zone Allocations Chris You should know that we are unhappy about something else now For the gas day you NNG did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal nomination to zero in the am process like normal because of a storage injection allocation Because of this WPL is going to get hit with SUL DDVC penalties EntergyKoch who handles the IES assests was surprised by this as well and IES may incur penalties too We werent trying to make an injection we were just trying to cut our withdrawal to zero We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we have been seeing lately Weve had conference call with Jean Blair and Jerry Wilkens on the topic We are also in trouble now for the gas day which we are current trying to figure a way out of You can add this item to our discussion topics when you visit Jeff Jeff Hicken Gas Trader AlliantEnergy Sebesta Chris AM Lynn as indicated in my voice mail Frank and I would like you to call Jeff Hicken of Alliant Energy He would like someone to explain why he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying to adjust his timely cycle noms later in the day to reflect lower requirements and what are his alternatives especially as storage may have a chance of being allocated

Lynn Floyd Jodie Subject RE IES Zone D DDVCs What was inferred by all was all of the stations listed on you spreadsheets that you provided in your email of that made reference to the fact that all of the stations listed for Octobers business that required PPAs would also require PPAs for November and December I assumed that these stations were the ones that we have issues with Thanks Gary Original Message From Zadow Raetta Sent Wednesday January PM To Anderson Gary E Cc Semin Frank Neubauer Dave Sebesta Chris Dietz Rick Blair Lynn Floyd Jodie Zadow Raetta Subject RE IES Zone D DDVCs Gary when you said that all December PPAs would be done by the th I think that we are all under the assumption that you mean all meters and not just the lists that we sent you that showed the four customers that we did for October Is that a correct assumption please let us know Thanks Raetta Original Message From Zadow Raetta Sent Wednesday January AM To Anderson Gary E Floyd Jodie Semin Frank Blair Lynn Neubauer Dave Cc Sebesta Chris Zadow Raetta Subject RE IES Zone D DDVCs Gary could you get a list of stations to Jodie or I for the ones that you have not received charts on yet so that we can see

corrected Original Message From Sebesta Chris Sent Thursday January PM To Semin Frank Subject FW IES Zone D DDVCs Importance High FYI I would like to respond asap I thought we addressed metering problems at our meeting Specifically they would be getting adjustments How long will estimates be occurring I am going to refer Jeffs Historical Meter Data remarks to Larry Berger I am also going to remind Jeff that he was going to get back to us if he want any historical data prior to May Lets talk this PM so I can respond Original Message From Bill Zorr mailto Sent Thursday January PM To Jeff Hicken Cc Anita Archibold Kelly Schneider Subject Re IES Zone D DDVCs Keep me posted on NN responses to your concerns Jeff Hicken PM Chris December Invoice We just went through the December invoices and we incurred DDVCs on days in IES Zone D that we arent going to pay This total is When we looked through the statements we found that at least of the gates were estimated the last half of the month and all of our DDVCs occurred between and Of the estimated gates at least were large Zone D gates We were short on which was a warm day and long on and which were all cold days so they all fit the pattern of getting charged incorrectly for DDVC because of estimated data In addition we think you may have metering problems at two gates Rowley Vinton Rowley looks like it quit working intermittently during the month We have some metering ourselves that matches fairly well some days and is way off others and ours looks more correct Vinton matches our data pretty well for the first half of the month but in the last half of the month something looks wrong You flat lined the last half of the month but your total for that period is about of what we got Your metering group can contact Anita Archibold to get our data We only have data at four Zone D gates and half of those looked wrongscary We havent looked at Zone BC yet because we didnt get DDVCs but are planning too Historical Metering Data Your metering group did help me download data gate data for last winter to get historical use data electronically However I still dont have anything for the year before There are two problems however with the winter I did get The download works very inconsistently Sometimes you have to try many times to get the download to work You cant download the actual current data and get it in one report you can only download whatever was in the bill that month For instance if you want to know what the actual gate station use was for Dec you would first download that month The problem is you wont get any data from corrections that occurred later and in this case I know that at the very least the Cherokee gate was off by a factor of ten That means that I also have to download many months after that and search all of those to find any corrections to a particular meter and cut and paste the data into the original download Its an ugly process to say the least and its one I really dont have time to do On the positive side my first couple of contacts with our new rep Karen have been good and thanks for your tip that Demarc could get allocated Jeff Jeff Hicken Gas
