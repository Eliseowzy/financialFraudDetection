<32621536.1075862295191.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kirk.stevens@enron.com,2001-06-07 08:00:00,Re FW Q forecastRod our last forecast showed the catchup for Q allocations spread over Q thru Q Instead we recorded the entire catchup for Q in May all Q No difference to the full year look just a change in shaping Hayslett Rod AM I thought the last forecast we reviewed had the catch up of the allocations included Original Message From Piro Jim Sent Wednesday June PM To Horton Stanley Cc Hayslett Rod Stevens Kirk Piro Jim FOWLER PEGGY Subject Q forecast Attached is a spreadsheet that compares our original plan budget plus overview to our forecast for the nd quarter with actuals for April and May and last months forecast for June We are in the process of completing our May closing but the IBIT number for May is complete The June forecast was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast of power cost and IBIT for June We should complete that next week Curves in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for June but I will know more next week The spreadsheet shows million IBIT compared to what I provided you early this week of million The primary difference is power cost and our view that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May that power cost could rise by an additional million from that level We are currently in the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables AA continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves If we have a good June we might want to increase our reserves however this is something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results are available Please call if you would like to discuss this further We will have a better look at June next week once the updated forecast is completed
