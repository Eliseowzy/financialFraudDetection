below blanks a Gas prices at TCOs pool for spot gas trades for April were per Dth the midpoint of Gas Dailys Columbia Appalachia price posting b ENA did receive various letters from TCO addressing Section c notifications The first notice was dated November The other two letters memorialized conversations regarding ENAs creditworthiness I can fax these to you c EES appears to not have received letters regarding creditworthiness or at least I can not find any correspondence Apparently phone conversations did occur that related to the fact that if EES pays their bills that TCO would continue to allow them to do business EES has paid their postpetition invoices with one exception a billing dispute of to that was related to nominating on a contract that had been recalled by the releasing shipper without notice to EES d Due to the uncertainty of whether TCO was going to allow EES to use the capacity EES did not use their capacity in December EES did pay the invoice however as is noted on Exhibit H e For providing adequate assurances of performance EES did not have to put up anything special like a guaranty or a letter of credit TCO has been requiring that EES maintain a minimum volume balance on EESs OBA Operational Balancing Agreement for their pool TCO has indicated that Dth should be the minimum OBA balance for April EESs OBA balance as of April is Dth Based on current forecasts EESs ending OBA balance will be Dth so EES will have to go out and purchase additional supplies to maintain TCOs April minimum balance of Dth This is the only thing that is happening that can be deemed a frozen parking balance f We can not find the misplaced invoice that would nail down how much gas may be due ENA in Item Just go with at least Dth g EES has not really been harmed in that they have been prevented in making sales Maintaining the minimum OBA balance has just increased their operating costs h On Eds affidavit the above changes need to be made Also please decide

PAL K This agreement was going to terminate on December and ENA wanted to zero out the balance by the termination date TCO refused to accept the nominations so the ratable gas deliveries of Dthday for

holding our gas ex Exhibit C ENA also tried to nominate a portion of the parked gas Dthday on January nd for Gas Day January rd deliveries Once again TCO did not accept ENAs nomination and no parked

sales agreements in ENAs portfolio of contracts ENA continues to be invoiced commodity charges under the IGS agreement for the postpetition period This leads to the question what has TCO done with
