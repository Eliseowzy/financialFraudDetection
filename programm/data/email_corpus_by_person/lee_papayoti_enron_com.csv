<10862380.1075845191558.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,lee.papayoti@enron.com,2001-05-31 11:32:07,Thank You AlsoKen I know it has been several years since we spoke but I wanted to thank you for your kind note and to personally thank you for the opportunities that Enron has provided to me over the years I am one of those few who was already with HNG in and still vividly r emember the day that you arrived The building was immediately permeated b y a sense of urgency and excitement That pace was relentless and addict ive I also remember in detail the Internorth merger in and feel pro ud to have played a part however small it was in that transaction The late s and the early s will probably always be my favorite ye ars of my working life There were so many initiatives in Enron in their i nfancy Although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics and ultimately failed I am grateful that Enron gave me the opportunity to participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure I never really understoo d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes I will try to remember Enron with those years through the mids in min d I have to say that I consider those to be the best years because I hav e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years That is clearly a subjective assessment and should be treated as such I am under no illusions Enron is a business entity operating in markets and environments that are relentlessly competitive with a primary responsibil ity to its shareholders But I and many of my colleagues who also have lon g tenure at Enron and its predecessors share this assessment I am always amused by the irony of the stated value Ruthlessness callousness and arro gance do not belong here since these appear to be the key defining person al characteristics of most of the senior management of ENA in recent years And unfortunately the very sale of HPL by Enron has been for some an examp le of the degradation of corporate culture For myself I know what to exp ect I know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf ormation as the transaction evolves But for the rank and file those w ho live from paycheck to paycheck it has not been a pleasant experience They maintained their professionalism indeed many of them probably worked harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen In return ther e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from Enron management and HR department with respect to their benefits and caree r choices HR in particular has been totally nonresponsive to individual inquiries in the past few months not returning phone calls and emails fro m HPL employees with questions even after the transaction was announced Even as recently as the past couple of days only upon receipt of their ter mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m isinformed by HR with respect to some aspects of their remaining Enron bene fits For myself my years at Enron will remain a high point of my career It is a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at Enron particularly for as many years as I was there I know Enron will continue to set the standards by most measures in this industry and for what its worth I humbly wish you continued success Thanks Lee Papayoti Forwarded by Lee L PapayotiHOUECT on AM FromKenneth nronXgate on PM ToTom NRON Janie CT Amelia AllandH CT Lauri A CT Aric nron Karl E A NRON

want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Com pany assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you f or your teamwork and success in our years together Some of you were here when I joined your company in but many of you a rrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line t o be the chairman I did not expect to ever join another energy company Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team wa s needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry enviro nment The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company wo uld be a good platform from which to make major changes And the results o ver the last years could not have been better Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron i nto what it is today Your professionalism ideas dedication and commitme nt toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possibl e For this you will not only be a critical part of Enrons history but you will also always deserve Enrons gratitude I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors even as I am s ure you will not need my good luck wishes As always your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opp ortunities Sincerely Embedded Picture Metafile
