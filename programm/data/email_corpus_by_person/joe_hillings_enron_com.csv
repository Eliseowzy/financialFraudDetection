have proposed launching limited negotations in early with the appointment of working groups who would negotiate a limited number of items as of yet unidentified with a view towards reaching agreement by WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated Many believe that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included in the General Agreement on Tariff Services GATS and merely need to be tweaked for defination purposes There is also recognition that a number of energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial services provisions We believe this is good news because it reduces the amount of bargaining that proenergy services negotiators may find necessary Our trade counsel Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our daytoday counselhas been very involved in the ecommerce issues and starting to get up to speed on financial services discussions Both are quite contentious even among US industry USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance in this sector because of these differences A new element called audiovisual has emerged which Bob Fisher Steve Chris and I believe applies to our interest in streaming It too is quite contentious especially with the Europeans who want to control this potential item Crosscutting Issues You will recall in our earlier insideEnron discussions we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles overlapping energy services ecommerce and financial services In a horozontal type of negotiation effectiveness and vigilance in identifying cross cutting issues can become critical These are now emerging as we had expected This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative effect Concerns The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece That is good news However the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture Agriculture has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services hostage unless getting their way What do we need Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider Chinas accession The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier date The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues that China wants addressed in their entry document Such an item as price controls on energy services and ecommerce Were uncertain how important that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies The politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the table The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council The critical task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a negotiation USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets Attendees would be WTO delegations and staff To put our best foot forward we need to get energy companies in nonUS countries actively involved in the presentation Some potential countries with energy sectors who are strong politically in the WTO are Venezuela Brazil India Egypt and South Africa That will take work between now and October st to get organized We have also asked AEI to get one of their contacts with developing nation standing to do a paper on the value of an energy services provision using Rachel Thompsons paper as a basis We need this by September but dont know if AEI will comply We met with Claude Barfield three weeks ago but he has not responded to our suggestion as yet Rachel Thompson has proposed an outreach strategy run by APCO and Associates which is her employer We would prefer to have Hills and Company run the program with people like Rachel providing assistance Budget I have asked Hills and Company to prepare a budget proposal for based on the assumption that Enron will continue to lead and provide the biggest amount to fund the US effort If we can get GE Halliburton and others to put in funds that would be excellent but is unlikely to materialize without Ken Lay speaking directly to GE Halliburton and whatever other players we can identify I see from the energy trade press Energy Daily on Thursday or Friday that Chevron has started an energy services division so as a member of ESC they too might contribute Our basic cost to maintain what we are currently doing will be approximately for The outreach as I see it would require another Hills and Co would be responsible for what they are currently doing on energy services and ecommerce the administration of the ESC and the outreach program It would be great if we could get others to put in funds Successful to date We have made good progress to date and believe that we are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation The additional interest in ecommerce and possibly financial services seems to make our leadership and involvment commercially important Joe

progress to date and believe that we are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation The additional interest in ecommerce and possibly financial services seems to make our leadership and involvment commercially important Joe

have proposed launching limited negotations in early with the appointment of working groups who would negotiate a limited number of items as of yet unidentified with a view towards reaching agreement by WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated Many believe that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included in the General Agreement on Tariff Services GATS and merely need to be tweaked for defination purposes There is also recognition that a number of energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial services provisions We believe this is good news because it reduces the amount of bargaining that proenergy services negotiators may find necessary Our trade counsel Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our daytoday counselhas been very involved in the ecommerce issues and starting to get up to speed on financial services discussions Both are quite contentious even among US industry USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance in this sector because of these differences A new element called audiovisual has emerged which Bob Fisher Steve Chris and I believe applies to our interest in streaming It too is quite contentious especially with the Europeans who want to control this potential item Crosscutting Issues You will recall in our earlier insideEnron discussions we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles overlapping energy services ecommerce and financial services In a horozontal type of negotiation effectiveness and vigilance in identifying cross cutting issues can become critical These are now emerging as we had expected This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative effect Concerns The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece That is good news However the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture Agriculture has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services hostage unless getting their way What do we need Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider Chinas accession The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier date The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues that China wants addressed in their entry document Such an item as price controls on energy services and ecommerce Were uncertain how important that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies The politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the table The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council The critical task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a negotiation USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets Attendees would be WTO delegations and staff To put our best foot forward we need to get energy companies in nonUS countries actively involved in the presentation Some potential countries with energy sectors who are strong politically in the WTO are Venezuela Brazil India Egypt and South Africa That will take work between now and October st to get organized We have also asked AEI to get one of their contacts with developing nation standing to do a paper on the value of an energy services provision using Rachel Thompsons paper as a basis We need this by September but dont know if AEI will comply We met with Claude Barfield three weeks ago but he has not responded to our suggestion as yet Rachel Thompson has proposed an outreach strategy run by APCO and Associates which is her employer We would prefer to have Hills and Company run the program with people like Rachel providing assistance Budget I have asked Hills and Company to prepare a budget proposal for based on the assumption that Enron will continue to lead and provide the biggest amount to fund the US effort If we can get GE Halliburton and others to put in funds that would be excellent but is unlikely to materialize without Ken Lay speaking directly to GE Halliburton and whatever other players we can identify I see from the energy trade press Energy Daily on Thursday or Friday that Chevron has started an energy services division so as a member of ESC they too might contribute Our basic cost to maintain what we are currently doing will be approximately for The outreach as I see it would require another Hills and Co would be responsible for what they are currently doing on energy services and ecommerce the administration of the ESC and the outreach program It would be great if we could get others to put in funds Successful to date We have made good progress to date and believe that we are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation The additional interest in ecommerce and possibly financial services seems to make our leadership and involvment commercially important Joe

<3781718.1075848088106.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joe.hillings@enron.com,2000-07-29 06:35:00,Your Voice Mail On Friday Re WTO Energy Services Activity Report UpdateSituation US and the European Community have proposed launching limited negotations in early with the appointment of working groups who would negotiate a limited number of items as of yet unidentified with a view towards reaching agreement by WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated Many believe that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included in the General Agreement on Tariff Services GATS and merely need to be tweaked for defination purposes There is also recognition that a number of energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial services provisions We believe this is good news because it reduces the amount of bargaining that proenergy services negotiators may find necessary Our trade counsel Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our daytoday counselhas been very involved in the ecommerce issues and starting to get up to speed on financial services discussions Both are quite contentious even among US industry USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance in this sector because of these differences A new element called audiovisual has emerged which Bob Fisher Steve Chris and I believe applies to our interest in streaming It too is quite contentious especially with the Europeans who want to control this potential item Crosscutting Issues You will recall in our earlier insideEnron discussions we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles overlapping energy services ecommerce and financial services In a horozontal type of negotiation effectiveness and vigilance in identifying cross cutting issues can become critical These are now emerging as we had expected This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative effect Concerns The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece That is good news However the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture Agriculture has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services hostage unless getting their way What do we need Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider Chinas accession The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier date The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues that China wants addressed in their entry document Such an item as price controls on energy services and ecommerce Were uncertain how important that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies The politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the table The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council The critical task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a negotiation USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets Attendees would be WTO delegations and staff To put our

<21621391.1075846393671.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joe.hillings@enron.com,2000-07-29 06:35:00,Your Voice Mail On Friday Re WTO Energy Services Activity Report UpdateSituation US and the European Community have proposed launching limited negotations in early with the appointment of working groups who would negotiate a limited number of items as of yet unidentified with a view towards reaching agreement by WTO members believe energy services should be negotiated Many believe that a number of the energy services we have identified are already included in the General Agreement on Tariff Services GATS and merely need to be tweaked for defination purposes There is also recognition that a number of energy services are thought to be included under the existing financial services provisions We believe this is good news because it reduces the amount of bargaining that proenergy services negotiators may find necessary Our trade counsel Hills and Co with Bob Fisher as our daytoday counselhas been very involved in the ecommerce issues and starting to get up to speed on financial services discussions Both are quite contentious even among US industry USTR is unable to come up with a common agreed position to advance in this sector because of these differences A new element called audiovisual has emerged which Bob Fisher Steve Chris and I believe applies to our interest in streaming It too is quite contentious especially with the Europeans who want to control this potential item Crosscutting Issues You will recall in our earlier insideEnron discussions we had made reference to the similarities in a set of general principles overlapping energy services ecommerce and financial services In a horozontal type of negotiation effectiveness and vigilance in identifying cross cutting issues can become critical These are now emerging as we had expected This means are interests cross over throughout these sectors and each presents an opportunity to get liberalization in one sector which has application in the others or a bad term in one can have a very negative effect Concerns The USTR has been telling various US industry groups that the energy services sector is far ahead of others and the USTR feels comfortable in an early effort to begin negotiating an energy services piece That is good news However the joker in the deck is how agriculture will be handled The Uruguay Round agreed to negotiate services and agriculture Agriculture has the strongest political interest and controversy and could hold services hostage unless getting their way What do we need Trade Ministers will be meeting in September to consider Chinas accession The politics is to get China admitted to WTO at an earlier date The WTO Working Party has discovered a number of problems and issues that China wants addressed in their entry document Such an item as price controls on energy services and ecommerce Were uncertain how important that is to Enron but we do know it is of concern to some US companies The politics of getting China admitted could sweep those type of issues under the table The WTO Committee on Specific Committments meets in October and could recommend an agenda for negotiations to the WTO General Council The critical task is for the WTO to get the support of the developing nations to launch a negotiation USTR has asked the Energy Services Coalition to organize and present information on energy services in a workshop setting in Geneva in early October before the Committee on Specific Committments meets Attendees would be WTO delegations and staff To put our best foot forward we need to get energy companies in nonUS countries actively involved in the presentation Some potential countries with energy sectors who are strong politically in the WTO are Venezuela Brazil India Egypt and South Africa That will take work between now and October st to get organized We have also asked AEI to get one of their contacts with developing nation standing to do a paper on the value of an energy services provision using Rachel Thompsons paper as a basis We need this by September but dont know if AEI will comply We met with Claude Barfield three weeks ago but he has not responded to our suggestion as yet Rachel Thompson has proposed an outreach strategy run by APCO and Associates which is her employer We would prefer to have Hills and Company run the program with people like Rachel providing assistance Budget I have asked Hills and Company to prepare a budget proposal for based on the assumption that Enron will continue to lead and provide the biggest amount to fund the US effort If we can get GE Halliburton and others to put in funds that would be excellent but is unlikely to materialize without Ken Lay speaking directly to GE Halliburton and whatever other players we can identify I see from the energy trade press Energy Daily on Thursday or Friday that Chevron has started an energy services division so as a member of ESC they too might contribute Our basic cost to maintain what we are currently doing will be approximately for The outreach as I see it would require another Hills and Co would be responsible for what they are currently doing on energy services and ecommerce the administration of the ESC and the outreach program It would be great if we could get others to put in funds Successful to date We have made good progress to date and believe that we are likely to be one of the sectors scheduled for negotiation The additional interest in ecommerce and possibly financial services seems to make our leadership and involvment commercially important Joe
