Bloomberg Enron Taps Billion From Bank Lines In PreEmptive Move to Ensure Liquidi ty Firm Will Pay Debt Keep Cash Cushion By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R Emshwiller Rebecca Smith an d Jathon Sapsford The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp drew down about billion the bulk of its available bank cred it lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu idity Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about billion of outstanding commercial paper shortterm corporate IOUs according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy c oncern with a cash cushion Some observers believe the move is a preemptiv e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibilliondollar credit line Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank s aid an Enron spokesman In a statement the companys new chief financial o fficer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are mak ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energytrading concern in the past days Enron is the natio ns largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly onequarter of all e lectricity and naturalgas trades Yesterday for example Enron was involv ed in about billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted Last week it reported a million thirdquarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer And rew S Fastow who was replaced Wednesday The drawdown of the credit facilities came as one rating agency Fitch pu t Enron on review for a possible downgrade while another Standard Poor s changed Enrons credit outlook to negative from stable Moodys Investor s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron In order to fall below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have t o fall several notches If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestmentgrade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that event Enron could be forced to issue mi llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt diluting the value of ex isting shares At pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enro n was down six cents at Liquidity is a key issue for Enron which handles energytrading volumes mo re than triple its nextbiggest competitor American Electric Power Co Enr ons EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform has transacted more than billion of trades since it was created in November The companys wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und erperforming assets elsewhere in the company chiefly the approximately billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate it takes time to sell assets parti cularly in todays slower economy The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha t have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealing s with Mr Fastow the former chief financial officer Internal documents r elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left Enron While Enron disclose d its Fastowrelated transactions in SEC filings a computerized search of the SECs database of public filings produced no reference to this other em ployeerelated entity known as Chewco Chewco was established in with approximately million in capital commitments to buy an interest in Enron assets according to one of the pa rtnerships documents The document didnt further specify what assets were purchased and it didnt disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper a manag ing director in Enrons Global Equity Markets Group according to the docum ent Enron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em ployeerelated entities were legal and properly disclosed didnt have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco Mr Kopper who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t o run the Fastowrelated partnerships didnt return phone calls A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr Kopper was traveling In respon se to questions about Chewco an Enron spokesman would say only that Micha el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron Mr Fastow repeatedly h as declined interview requests He severed his relationships with the partn erships in July This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar ding relatedparty transactions Under SEC rule SK a company has to repor t any transaction that exceeds and involves any director or execut ive officer By contrast Mr Fastow as CFO would have fallen into that category but Mr Kopper as managing director of a business unit presumab ly wouldnt have However reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard seems to have a broader definition one that might include Mr Kopper According to FAS Statement a relatedparty transaction involves a mate rial piece of business between the company and a member of management The statement defines management as directors top officers

past two weeks That is far less than the decline in Enrons stock price since the Oct disclosure of a billion charge linked to soured investments resu lting in a million thirdquarter loss But the fall in the bonds pric e translates to a yield of percentage points above bellwether US gove rnment bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two we eks ago Although Enron still is an investmentgrade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl e B or lower Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than billion on its bank credit l ines to shore up its finances Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds Yes terdays bid for instance was for a block of less than million in b onds a small percentage of a typical trade Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that creditrating

as lumber metals bandwidth capacit y and steel As a market maker matching buyers and sellers Enron handles a bout a quarter of all the trading in the nations energy and gas markets Enrons

Enron By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about In recent years Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly critic s would say blindly enthusiastic about Enron even as they acknowledge n ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f or its soaring profits Now Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i ts most complicated transactions which many on Wall Street still cant fig ure out In a research note Wednesday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif ficult to value the company The companys lack of disclosure and transpar ency he says is a longstanding Enron hallmark So is this a stock to avoid in his view Hardly Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its US Select List which consists of a few dozen top st ock picks but Mr Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firms la rger but prestigious Recommended List of or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined Goldman in Just because I cant be specific in being able to create a simple model doesnt mean that you write off that industry and say I cant analyze it or I cant figure it out says Mr Fleischer who owns an undisclos ed number of Enron shares If that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldnt follow Enrons shares have dropped about since last week Every sellside analyst we spoke to early in admitted that this was a black box says Jim Chanos principal of Kynikos Associates in New York who has been selling Enron stock short trading it with an eye to profiti ng from its fall throughout this year It was really a trustme story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l evel of trust True no stock picker is immune from bad calls And Wall Street analysts lo ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investmentbanking deals to be had But Enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still rec ommending the stock have acknowledged that the companys disclosure practic es are lacking Which raises the question How can an analyst recommend tha t others purchase a stock when key information about the companys operatio ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business arent new Many of the issues now plaguing Enrons stock were first raised more than a year ago b y bearish hedgefund managers and independent accounting experts Yet time and again Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger ing questions about the companys various partnership transactions Besides those partnerships Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings Through it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stockmarket darli ng publicly dismissing questions about the firms accounting practices and level of disclosure As of yesterday of the analysts who following the stock had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call Five others rated the stock a buy thoug h not strongly Only Prudential Securities which downgraded the stock this week has a se ll rating on Enron The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most highprofile exampl es of Wall Street taking a glass halffull stance despite what in retrospe ct seems to be ample warning that a lessenthusiastic approach was warrante d Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Indexs general coll apse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence part icularly those who like Goldmans Mr Fleischer own shares in the compani es they cover Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investmentbanking fees an d other revenue Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms For instance fo r one million equity offering in led by Credit Suisse First Bost on Enron retained seven comanagers including Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch Enron is a big company and I dont think youre going to find a firm that hasnt been involved says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a price target They p ay a lot of investmentbanking fees to Wall Street He adds We do our analysis every day based on the information we have Ar e we here strictly to defend companies Thats ludicrous Were here to pro vide information to investors Yes I have the wrong recommendation o n the stock I dont think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p erformed Mr Fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small But he di sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised Mr Fleischer sa ys his clients are happy to know he has a stake in Enron because it show s he puts his money where his mouth is In his research note Wednesday Mr Fleischer called for complete disclosur es of Enrons offbalance sheet partnerships Despite the resulting difficu lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given Enron th e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position a s an industry leader Theres not information to really model this and be able to predict accura tely where revenues are going to come from and where theyre going to make their money but every quarter they do he says Its hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver CSFBs Mr Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasio nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press On Monday he wrote that he expects questions about Enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for Enron an d an ultimate recovery in the share price I know Im wrong on the stock Mr Launer says But he says that at these prices he isnt ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worstcase scenario under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as billion worth of shares diluting current holders the stoc k doesnt have much further to fall Clearly Messrs Launer and Flesicher arent alone Even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says Chuck Hill director of research at Thomson FinancialFirst Call The average rating for a stock o n Wall Street is or slightly shy of a buy rating Enron scores a This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out Mr Hill says In downgrading the stock this week Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i t to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her rece nt downgrades come too little too late Ms Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years She says the co mpanys disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions For instance she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission They said no she says In light of the companys acknowledgment this week of an SEC inquiry she asked Enron about the previous

Column c New York Times Company CAN the new friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy Harvey L Pitt the new SEC chairman set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor Arthur Levitt In a speech to the American Ins titute of Certified Public Accountants an organization whose senior lead ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr Levitts reform efforts Mr Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h is predecessor From now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing wa y He spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev en the worst profit figures look pretty There was no mention of Mr Levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings On the heels of Mr Pitts speech the SEC used a minor enforcement acti on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t o report their own errors The decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years But the way the SEC trumpeted it raised qu estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th an a guard dog Is this amnesty for financial fraud Jane Adams the ac counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former SEC staff me mber asked in a report to clients She was not sure of the answer In an interview yesterday Mr Pitt dismissed such worries No one is goi ng to get away with anything he said What we are trying to do is crea te an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the SEC without feeling we are looking for a big splash A major embarrassment for accountants is having the SEC force a client t o restate its numbers Mr Pitt and his chief accountant Robert Herdman a re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made I am very much i n favor of a vigorous enforcement program Mr Pitt said in the interview but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state ments and restatements Mr Pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which woul d certainly be nice But there is a risk that companies will become more ag gressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like a restatement if they are caught That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting In trying to sound comforting to the accountants group an organization that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades Mr Pi tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence The proof of course will come in the performance Fortunately the mess a t Enron gives the SEC a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image I t will take time for the commission to determine if the companys accountin g was proper But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai n rather than obfuscate as it has so far the strange deals it made wi th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer This could a former SEC staff member said focus the issue on whe ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur es

Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved NEW YORK AP As it grew over the past decade into the countrys largest natural gas and power marketing company Enron Corp became the de facto ba rometer of health within the energy trading sector Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enrons competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houstonbased companys business model Now execu tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enrons internal tumult and fre efalling stock price from undermining investors confidence in the sector They say the Houstonbased companys problems should be viewed in isolatio n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday a week ago or a month ago said Jim Donnell president of Duke Energy North America a division of Duke Energy Corp that generates and tr ades power That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In c El Paso Corp and Duke Energy Corp rebounded from losses on Wednesday when Enrons latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i ts rivals Enrons stock has fallen about percent in the past week and nearly p ercent since January and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim e soon The latest troubles began Oct when Enron reported third quarter earning s and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n ot entirely forthcoming only got worse First came reports that some of the companys losses stemmed from partnersh ips managed by Enrons chief financial officer at the time Andrew Fastow That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission Then on Wednesday one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didnt come through with flying colors said Christopher Ellingh aus an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old which have little to do with the companys wholesale energy business which accounts for roughly percent of profits Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices Even though Enron shot themselves in the foot the basic business is sti ll sound and not likely to disappear Ellinghaus said UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment The collateral damage to the rest of the space Dynegy and El Paso is o verdone Barone said On Thursday Williams Companies Inc of Tulsa Okla reported net income o f million and Reliant Resources Inc of Houston reported million in profits Its business as usual said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel Not for Enron whose stock price began a steady descent months ago when its nascent highspeed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype The dow nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of thenchief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign On Oct Enron reported a net loss of million in the third quarter taking a onetime charge of billion attributed to investment losses troubled assets and unit restructurings Excluding the charge Enron earne d million on billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep t Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enrons competitors were brought down Wednesd ay because of dire speculation that Enrons troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy All Im hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality Ellin ghaus said Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte NCbased company is paying clo se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o f receivables not being paid They continue to be one of the best

The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the possibility that Enron wont generate enough money from selling assets outside the main trading business to repay debt SP did say that the

things down Shares of Enron fell cents to Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom or Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update New York Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update Adds new Enron CFO in th paragraph Houston Oct Bloomberg Concerns Enron Corp will run short on cash havent prevented commodities traders from doing business with the largest energy broker customers say The company handles about percent of US power and naturalgas trading said John Kilduff vice president of energy risk management for Fimat USA Its also a leader in complex derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of fluctuating commodities prices Enrons credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors lowered Enrons longterm credit outlook to negative after billion in third quarter losses from some soured investments The company needs good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions So far there are no signs that Houstonbased Enron is handling less business Kilduff said If they were unable to perform it would be a major problem he said It could get like LongTerm Capital if things really broke down because the numbers are that big LongTerm Capital Management a private investment fund for the wealthy incurred massive losses making bond trades during the Russian currency crisis The funds portfolio plunged More than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of billion to avoid a collapse Needs Cash Daily Enron trades electricity natural gas coal and other commodities worldwide as well as complex financial instruments to hedge against price swings in the goods As of now Enron is active in the markets Kilduff said No one is cutting trading lines that I can see or demanding different terms than before Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every day to settle positions said Kilduff whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with Enron Some days Fimat will bet that naturalgas prices will fall while Enron bets that they will rise Natural gas usually does one or the other every day and someone pays the difference The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor Kilduff said Someone is paying someone else every day Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough money to operate normally and can fall back on billion in bank credit lines if necessary The company is determined to protect the credit rating Enron has said We arent even going to entertain worstcase scenarios at this point said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne Investor Questions Enron based in Houston ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow yesterday two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he ran that invested in company shares Those trades cost Enron million Jeff McMahon head of Enrons industrial markets unit replaced Fastow who went on leave of absence Enron shares have fallen percent in the past week They fell cents to today Based on Bloomberg composite ratings most of Enrons long term debt is rated at BBB and BBB two or three levels above investment grade Fitch Standard Poors and Moodys all rate the companys debt at investment grade The company also faces questions from investors about billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to meet them by selling assets Enron doesnt know if the sale proceeds will cover the debt The company would have to make good on any shortfall Little Time Enron asked Citicorp Inc on Tuesday to arrange a million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut out of the money markets Enron had about billion of commercial paper or short term unsecured debt outstanding as of Tuesday traders said The company which has a billion program has had difficulty finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC investigation was announced the traders said Today Enron offered twoweek commercial paper at a percent yield to basis points above comparably rated companies There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough time to get their house in order said Jon Kyle Cartwright senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James Associates Theres a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so they have less time than they think to pacify the market Ripple Effect Some investors are concerned that Enrons complex book of hedges swaps options and other derivative contracts involves so many partners participants and companies that a failure would pose a risk to the economy and force a bailout like LongTerm Capital Managements The talk in the financial markets is that some counter party to Enron could fail if Enron cant perform said Jeff Caughron manager of million in investments for Tinker Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City If it goes down there could be a big ripple effect The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron wont be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine Corp Dynegy Inc Mirant Corp and NRG Inc said Chris Ellinghaus an analyst at Williams Capital Group As a group shares of the four have fallen percent in the past week Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are fueling a selloff he said Both traders and companies selling power to Enron are suffering All four companies said theyre trading with Enron as they have in the past Market Maker Enron supplies services some customers consider irreplaceable The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges weather risk through Enron said risk manager Jim Tracy The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate at peak efficiency and capacity in dry seasons when the dams cant operate as well Enron pays the district If Enrons credit went bad or they folded up that agreement wouldnt get picked up by someone else Tracy said Enron also helps many US utilities protect themselves from electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little rainfall Any impairment on Enrons part to continue doing so would trickle down to Main Street utilities Tracy said Utilities would start reserving more on their balance sheets for price swings Tracy said Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at or at Enron

Weve done that many times As for future power prices Calpine said that its going forward with its p rogram to build a portfolio of megawatts of generation which is abo ut three times its current

Bloomberg Enron Taps Billion From Bank Lines In PreEmptive Move to Ensure Liquidi ty Firm Will Pay Debt Keep Cash Cushion By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R Emshwiller Rebecca Smith an d Jathon Sapsford The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Corp drew down about billion the bulk of its available bank cred it lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu idity Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about billion of outstanding commercial paper shortterm corporate IOUs according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy c oncern with a cash cushion Some observers believe the move is a preemptiv e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibilliondollar credit line Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank s aid an Enron spokesman In a statement the companys new chief financial o fficer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are mak ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energytrading concern in the past days Enron is the natio ns largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly onequarter of all e lectricity and naturalgas trades Yesterday for example Enron was involv ed in about billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted Last week it reported a million thirdquarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer And rew S Fastow who was replaced Wednesday The drawdown of the credit facilities came as one rating agency Fitch pu t Enron on review for a possible downgrade while another Standard Poor s changed Enrons credit outlook to negative from stable Moodys Investor s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron In order to fall below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have t o fall several notches If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestmentgrade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that event Enron could be forced to issue mi llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt diluting the value of ex isting shares At pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enro n was down six cents at Liquidity is a key issue for Enron which handles energytrading volumes mo re than triple its nextbiggest competitor American Electric Power Co Enr ons EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform has transacted more than billion of trades since it was created in November The companys wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und erperforming assets elsewhere in the company chiefly the approximately billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate it takes time to sell assets parti cularly in todays slower economy The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha t have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealing s with Mr Fastow the former chief financial officer Internal documents r elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left Enron While Enron disclose d its Fastowrelated transactions in SEC filings a computerized search of the SECs database of public filings produced no reference to this other em ployeerelated entity known as Chewco Chewco was established in with approximately million in capital commitments to buy an interest in Enron assets according to one of the pa rtnerships documents The document didnt further specify what assets were purchased and it didnt disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper a manag ing director in Enrons Global Equity Markets Group according to the docum ent Enron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em ployeerelated entities were legal and properly disclosed didnt have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco Mr Kopper who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t o run the Fastowrelated partnerships didnt return phone calls A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr Kopper was traveling In respon se to questions about Chewco an Enron spokesman would say only that Micha el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron Mr Fastow repeatedly h as declined interview requests He severed his relationships with the partn erships in July This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar ding relatedparty transactions Under SEC rule SK a company has to repor t any transaction that exceeds and involves any director or execut ive officer By contrast Mr Fastow as CFO would have fallen into that category but Mr Kopper as managing director of a business unit presumab ly wouldnt have However reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard seems to have a broader definition one that might include Mr Kopper According to FAS Statement a relatedparty transaction involves a mate rial piece of business between the company and a member of management The statement defines management as directors top officers

Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre ditRating Concerns By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Enron Corps bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energytrading powerhouse Not for long some bond traders say In trading yesterday the Houston companys fiveyear bond a million issue due in July carrying a coupon of was quoted at cents on the dollar down from a bid of late Wednesday and representing a d rop during the past two weeks That is far less than the decline in Enrons stock price since the Oct disclosure of a billion charge linked to soured investments resu lting in a million thirdquarter loss But the fall in the bonds pric e translates to a yield of percentage points above bellwether US gove rnment bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two we eks ago Although Enron still is an investmentgrade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl e B or lower Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than billion on its bank credit l ines to shore up its finances Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds Yes terdays bid for instance was for a block of less than million in b onds a small percentage of a typical trade Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that creditrating con cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga tion and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer Even at these levels theres very little buying interest said Harold Ri vkin a principal at distresseddebt trader H Rivkin Co in Princeton N J In one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect thems elves from losses on Enron debt was surging The cost of a default swap in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac e value in the event of default rose to of the size of the credit be ing insured That was up from a day earlier and more than holders of Lu cent Technologies Inc debt had to pay at the height of that technology com panys troubles earlier during the year Even with its woes Enron remains an investmentgrade company Most credit rating agencies rate Enrons senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestmentgrade level Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enrons credit rating on watch for a possib le downgrade following a similar move by Moodys Investors Service last we ek Standard Poors a division of McGraw Hill Cos stopped short of pu tting the company on its Creditwatch list opting instead to revise its lon gterm ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the companys f inancial flexibility Meanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst These are investmentgrade bonds that are migrating toward dis tressed levels said Glenn Reynolds an analyst at Credit Sights Inc an independent fixedincome research firm in New York They arent distressed yet but they are headed in that direction If Enrons credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the c ompanys ability to raise money For an energy trader a credit downgrade s ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities Though it is best known fo r trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacit y and steel As a market maker matching buyers and sellers Enron handles a bout a quarter of all the trading in the nations energy and gas markets Enrons creditworthiness is hugely important The better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commoditi es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers Without th at credit rating the cost of this highmargin highvolume business starts to rise A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derive d from that of an underlying

Enron By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about In recent years Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly critic s would say blindly enthusiastic about Enron even as they acknowledge n ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f or its soaring profits Now Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i ts most complicated transactions which many on Wall Street still cant fig ure out In a research note Wednesday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif ficult to value the company The companys lack of disclosure and transpar ency he says is a longstanding Enron hallmark So is this a stock to avoid in his view Hardly Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its US Select List which consists of a few dozen top st ock picks but Mr Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firms la rger but prestigious Recommended List of or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined Goldman in Just because I cant be specific in being able to create a simple model doesnt mean that you write off that industry and say I cant analyze it or I cant figure it out says Mr Fleischer who owns an undisclos ed number of Enron shares If that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldnt follow Enrons shares have dropped about since last week Every sellside analyst we spoke to early in admitted that this was a black box says Jim Chanos principal of Kynikos Associates in New York who has been selling Enron stock short trading it with an eye to profiti ng from its fall throughout this year It was really a trustme story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l evel of trust True no stock picker is immune from bad calls And Wall Street analysts lo ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investmentbanking deals to be had But Enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still rec ommending the stock have acknowledged that the companys disclosure practic es are lacking Which raises the question How can an analyst recommend tha t others purchase a stock when key information about the companys operatio ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business arent new Many of the issues now plaguing Enrons stock were first raised more than a year ago b y bearish hedgefund managers and independent accounting experts Yet time and again Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger ing questions about the companys various partnership transactions Besides those partnerships Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings Through it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stockmarket darli ng publicly dismissing questions about the firms accounting practices and level of disclosure As of yesterday of the analysts who following the stock had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call Five others rated the stock a buy thoug h not strongly Only Prudential Securities which downgraded the stock this week has a se ll rating on Enron The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most highprofile exampl es of Wall Street taking a glass halffull stance despite what in retrospe ct seems to be ample warning that a lessenthusiastic approach was warrante d Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Indexs general coll apse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence part icularly those who like Goldmans Mr Fleischer own shares in the compani es they cover Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investmentbanking fees an d other revenue Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms For instance fo r one million equity offering in led by Credit Suisse First Bost on Enron retained seven comanagers including Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch Enron is a big company and I dont think youre going to find a firm that hasnt been involved says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a price target They p ay a lot of investmentbanking fees to Wall Street He adds We do our analysis every day based on the information we have Ar e we here strictly to defend companies Thats ludicrous Were here to pro vide information to investors Yes I have the wrong recommendation o n the stock I dont think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p erformed Mr Fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small But he di sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised Mr Fleischer sa ys his clients are happy to know he has a stake in Enron because it show s he puts his money where his mouth is In his research note Wednesday Mr Fleischer called for complete disclosur es of Enrons offbalance sheet partnerships Despite the resulting difficu lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given Enron th e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position a s an industry leader Theres not information to really model this and be able to predict accura tely where revenues are going to come from and where theyre going to make their money but every quarter they do he says Its hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver CSFBs Mr Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasio nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press On Monday he wrote that he expects questions about Enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for Enron an d an ultimate recovery in the share price I know Im wrong on the stock Mr Launer says But he says that at these prices he isnt ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worstcase scenario under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as billion worth of shares diluting current holders the stoc k doesnt have much further to fall Clearly Messrs Launer and Flesicher arent alone Even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says Chuck Hill director of research at Thomson FinancialFirst Call The average rating for a stock o n Wall Street is or slightly shy of a buy rating Enron scores a This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out Mr Hill says In downgrading the stock this week Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i t to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her rece nt downgrades come too little too late Ms Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years She says the co mpanys disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions For instance she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission They said no she says In light of the companys acknowledgment this week of an SEC inquiry she asked Enron about the previous

which is now under Democrat control It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans who favour cor porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession and Democrats who

Column c New York Times Company CAN the new friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy Harvey L Pitt the new SEC chairman set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor Arthur Levitt In a speech to the American Ins titute of Certified Public Accountants an organization whose senior lead ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr Levitts reform efforts Mr Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h is predecessor From now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing wa y He spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev en the worst profit figures look pretty There was no mention of Mr Levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings On the heels of Mr Pitts speech the SEC used a minor enforcement acti on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t o report their own errors The decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years But the way the SEC trumpeted it raised qu estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th an a guard dog Is this amnesty for financial fraud Jane Adams the ac counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former SEC staff me mber asked in a report to clients She was not sure of the answer In an interview yesterday Mr Pitt dismissed such worries No one is goi ng to get away with anything he said What we are trying to do is crea te an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the SEC without feeling we are looking for a big splash A major embarrassment for accountants is having the SEC force a client t o restate its numbers Mr Pitt and his chief accountant Robert Herdman a re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made I am very much i n favor of a vigorous enforcement program Mr Pitt said in the interview but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state ments and restatements Mr Pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which woul d certainly be nice But there is a risk that companies will become more ag gressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like a restatement if they are caught That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting In trying to sound comforting to the accountants group an organization that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades Mr Pi tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence The proof of course will come in the performance Fortunately the mess a t Enron gives the SEC a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image I t will take time for the commission to determine if the companys accountin g was proper But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai n rather than obfuscate as it has so far the strange deals it made wi th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer This could a former SEC staff member said focus the issue on whe ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur es

Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved NEW YORK AP As it grew over the past decade into the countrys largest natural gas and power marketing company Enron Corp became the de facto ba rometer of health within the energy trading sector Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enrons competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houstonbased companys business model Now execu tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enrons internal tumult and fre efalling stock price from undermining investors confidence in the sector They say the Houstonbased companys problems should be viewed in isolatio n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday a week ago or a month ago said Jim Donnell president of Duke Energy North America a division of Duke Energy Corp that generates and tr ades power That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In c El Paso Corp and Duke Energy Corp rebounded from losses on Wednesday when Enrons latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i ts rivals Enrons stock has fallen about percent in the past week and nearly p ercent since January and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim e soon The latest troubles began Oct when Enron reported third quarter earning s and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n ot entirely forthcoming only got worse First came reports that some of the companys losses stemmed from partnersh ips managed by Enrons chief financial officer at the time Andrew Fastow That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission Then on Wednesday one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didnt come through with flying colors said Christopher Ellingh aus an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old which have little to do with the companys wholesale energy business which accounts for roughly percent of profits Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices Even though Enron shot themselves in the foot the basic business is sti ll sound and not likely to disappear Ellinghaus said UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment The collateral damage to the rest of the space Dynegy and El Paso is o verdone Barone said On Thursday Williams Companies Inc of Tulsa Okla reported net income o f million and Reliant Resources Inc of Houston reported million in profits Its business as usual said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel Not for Enron whose stock price began a steady descent months ago when its nascent highspeed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype The dow nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of thenchief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign On Oct Enron reported a net loss of million in the third quarter taking a onetime charge of billion attributed to investment losses troubled assets and unit restructurings Excluding the charge Enron earne d million on billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep t Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enrons competitors were brought down Wednesd ay because of dire speculation that Enrons troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy All Im hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality Ellin ghaus said Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte NCbased company is paying clo se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o f receivables not being paid They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit he said Theyve never missed a deadline AP Graphic ENERGY STOCKS Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Enrons Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by SP Update New York Enrons Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by SP Update Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph Houston Oct Bloomberg Enron Corps longterm credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by Standard Poors after the largest energy traders shares fell percent in the past week SP affirmed the Houstonbased companys ratings of BBBA which are investment grade The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the possibility that Enron wont generate enough money from selling assets outside the main trading business to repay debt SP did say that the strategic direction of the company is likely to become more creditpositive in the wake of recent management changes Enron reported billion in losses from investments outside the principal business of trading commodities such as electricity and natural gas Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow resigned yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission asks for information about relatedparty transactions he conducted The SP write up was very positive said Dorothea Matthews an analyst at CreditSights Inc a research firm It seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and calm things down Shares of Enron fell cents to Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom or Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update New York Enrons Trading Partners Say Its Business as Usual Update Adds new Enron CFO in th paragraph Houston Oct Bloomberg Concerns Enron Corp will run short on cash havent prevented commodities traders from doing business with the largest energy broker customers say The company handles about percent of US power and naturalgas trading said John Kilduff vice president of energy risk management for Fimat USA Its also a leader in complex derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of fluctuating commodities prices Enrons credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors lowered Enrons longterm credit outlook to negative after billion in third quarter losses from some soured investments The company needs good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions So far there are no signs that Houstonbased Enron is handling less business Kilduff said If they were unable to perform it would be a major problem he said It could get like LongTerm Capital if things really broke down because the numbers are that big LongTerm Capital Management a private investment fund for the wealthy incurred massive losses making bond trades during the Russian currency crisis The funds portfolio plunged More than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of billion to avoid a collapse Needs Cash Daily Enron trades electricity natural gas coal and other commodities worldwide as well as complex financial instruments to hedge against price swings in the goods As of now Enron is active in the markets Kilduff said No one is cutting trading lines that I can see or demanding different terms than before Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every day to settle positions said Kilduff whose company swaps natural gas and other energy investments with Enron Some days Fimat will bet that naturalgas prices will fall while Enron bets that they will rise Natural gas usually does one or the other every day and someone pays the difference The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor Kilduff said Someone is paying someone else every day Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough money to operate normally and can fall back on billion in bank credit lines if necessary The company is determined to protect the credit rating Enron has said We arent even going to entertain worstcase scenarios at this point said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne Investor Questions Enron based in Houston ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow yesterday two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he ran that invested in company shares Those trades cost Enron million Jeff McMahon head of Enrons industrial markets unit replaced Fastow who went on leave of absence Enron shares have fallen percent in the past week They fell cents to today Based on Bloomberg composite ratings most of Enrons long term debt is rated at BBB and BBB two or three levels above investment grade Fitch Standard Poors and Moodys all rate the companys debt at investment grade The company also faces questions from investors about billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to meet them by selling assets Enron doesnt know if the sale proceeds will cover the debt The company would have to make good on any shortfall Little Time Enron asked Citicorp Inc on Tuesday to arrange a million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut out of the money markets Enron had about billion of commercial paper or short term unsecured debt outstanding as of Tuesday traders said The company which has a billion program has had difficulty finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC investigation was announced the traders said Today Enron offered twoweek commercial paper at a percent yield to basis points above comparably rated companies There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough time to get their house in order said Jon Kyle Cartwright senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James Associates Theres a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self fulfilling prophecy so they have less time than they think to pacify the market Ripple Effect Some investors are concerned that Enrons complex book of hedges swaps options and other derivative contracts involves so many partners participants and companies that a failure would pose a risk to the economy and force a bailout like LongTerm Capital Managements The talk in the financial markets is that some counter party to Enron could fail if Enron cant perform said Jeff Caughron manager of million in investments for Tinker Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City If it goes down there could be a big ripple effect The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron wont be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine Corp Dynegy Inc Mirant Corp and NRG Inc said Chris Ellinghaus an analyst at Williams Capital Group As a group shares of the four have fallen percent in the past week Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are fueling a selloff he said Both traders and companies selling power to Enron are suffering All four companies said theyre trading with Enron as they have in the past Market Maker Enron supplies services some customers consider irreplaceable The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges weather risk through Enron said risk manager Jim Tracy The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate at peak efficiency and capacity in dry seasons when the dams cant operate as well Enron pays the district If Enrons credit went bad or they folded up that agreement wouldnt get picked up by someone else Tracy said Enron also helps many US utilities protect themselves from electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little rainfall Any impairment on Enrons part to continue doing so would trickle down to Main Street utilities Tracy said Utilities would start reserving more on their balance sheets for price swings Tracy said Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at or at Enron

stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of longterm power contracts Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts which on a marktomarket basis are worth far less now th an when California bought this past winter and spring Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont racts In general we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t o do so as well said Calpine cheif executive Peter Cartwright If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a winwin we would be happy to look at that if California asks Weve done that many times As for future power prices Calpine said that its going forward with its p rogram to build a portfolio of megawatts of generation which is abo ut three times its current capacity and would be about of all US capac ity The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d ifference between natural gas prices and power prices and Calpine said tha t

THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS ONE Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday September AM To Subject Civil Discourse Bulletin Recent posting in Terrors Aftermath in Public Affairs The following essay outlining how long the struggle against terrorism might last has been making the rounds on the Internet Interestingly it is being forwarded by both hawks and doves Perhaps the latter see this as a wakeup call while the former see it as an argument for a more overwhelming response This was written by Dr Tony Kern a retired Air force colonel and an academic advisor at the USAF Academy Like everyone else in this great country I am reeling from last weeks attack on our sovereignty But unlike some I am not reeling from surprise As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history I have a different perspective and I think you should hear it This war will be won or lost by the American citizens not diplomats politicians or soldiers Let me briefly explain In spite of what the media and even our own government is telling us this act was not committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes This attack was committed by a ferocious intelligent and dedicated adversary Dont take this the wrong way I dont admire these men and I deplore their tactics but I respect their capabilities The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America but also because we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of caves years after we think this war is over just like my fathers generation had to do with the formidable Japanese in the years following WW II These men hate the United States with all of their being and we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment Napoleon perhaps the worlds greatest combination of soldier and statesman stated the moral is to the physical as three is to one Patton thought the Frenchman underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more important in battle than physical strength Our enemies are willingbetter said anxiousto give their lives for their cause How committed are we America And for how long In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction the recent attack demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught to most military officers worldwide namely simplicity security and surprise When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been trained at our own Air War College it made perfect sense to me This was not a random act of violence and we can expect the same sort of military competence to be displayed in the battle to come This war will escalate with a good portion of it happening right here in the good ole US of A These men will not go easily into the night They do not fear us We must not fear them In spite of our overwhelming conventional strength as the worlds only superpower a truly silly term we are the underdog in this fight As you listen to the carefully scripted rhetoric designed to prepare us for the march for war please realize that America is not equipped or seriously trained for the battle ahead To be certain our soldiers are much better than the enemy and we have some excellent counterterrorist organizations but they are mostly trained for hostage rescues airfield seizures or the occasional body snatch which may come in handy We will be fighting a war of annihilation because if their early efforts are any indication our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last man Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming They have already deployed their forces in as many as countries and are likely living the lives of everyday citizens Simply put our soldiers will be tasked with a search and destroy mission on multiple foreign landscapes and the public must be patient and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be worked out For the most part our military is still in the process of redefining itself and is presided over by men and women who grew up withand were promoted because they excelled inCold War doctrine strategy and tactics This will not be linear warfare and there will be no clear centers of gravity to strike with high technology weapons Our vast technological edge will certainly be helpful but it will not be decisive Perhaps the perfect metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the terrorists themselves aboard the hijacked aircraftthis will be a knife fight and it will be won or lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers not by software or smart bombs We must also be patient with our military leaders Unlike Americans who are eager to put this messy time behind us our adversaries have time on their side and they will use it They plan to fight a battle of attrition hoping to drag the battle out until the American public loses its will to fight This might be difficult to believe in this euphoric time of flag waving and patriotism but it is generally acknowledged that America lacks the stomach for a long fight We need only look as far back as Vietnam when North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap also a military history teacher defeated the United States of America without ever winning a major tactical battle American soldiers who marched to war cheered on by flagwaving Americans in were reviled and spat upon less than three years later when they returned Although we hope that Usama Bin Laden is no Giap he is certain to understand and employ the concept We can expect not only large doses of pain like the recent attacks but also less audacious sand in the gears tactics ranging from livestock infestations to attacks on water supplies and power distribution facilities These attacks are designed to hit us in our comfort zone forcing the average American to pay more and play less and eventually erode his resolve But it can only work if we let it It is clear to me that the will of the American citizenryyou and Iis the center of gravity the enemy has targeted It will be the fulcrum upon which victory or defeat will turn He believes us to be soft impatient and selfcentered He may be right but if so we must change The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz the most often quoted and least read military theorist in history says that there is a remarkable trinity of war that is composed of the will of the people the political leadership of the government and the chance and probability that plays out on the field of battle in that order Every American citizen was in the crosshairs of last Tuesdays attack not just those that were unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center or Pentagon The will of the American people will decide this war If we are to win it will be because we have what it takes to persevere through a few more hits learn from our mistakes improvise and adapt If we can do that we will eventually prevail Everyone Ive talked to in the past few days has shared a common frustration saying in one form or another I just wish I could do something You are already doing it Just keep faith in America and

Lenhart Matthew Blanchard Timothy Parks Joe Martin Thomas A Schwieger Jim Winfree ONeal D Love Phillip M Weldon V Charles Subject FW Civil Discourse Bulletin THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS ONE Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday September AM To Subject Civil Discourse Bulletin Recent posting in Terrors Aftermath in Public Affairs The following essay outlining how long the struggle against terrorism might last has been making the rounds on the Internet Interestingly it is being forwarded by both hawks and doves Perhaps the latter see this as a wakeup call while the former see it as an argument for a more overwhelming response This was written by Dr Tony Kern a retired Air force colonel and an academic advisor at the USAF Academy Like everyone else in this great country I am reeling from last weeks attack on our sovereignty But unlike some I am not reeling from surprise As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history I have a different perspective and I think you should hear it This war will be won or lost by the American citizens not diplomats politicians or soldiers Let me briefly explain In spite of what the media and even our own government is telling us this act was not committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes This attack was committed by a ferocious intelligent and dedicated adversary Dont take this the wrong way I dont admire these men and I deplore their tactics but I respect their capabilities The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America but also because we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of caves years after we think this war is over just like my fathers generation had to do with the formidable Japanese in the years following WW II These men hate the United States with all of their being and we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment Napoleon perhaps the worlds greatest combination of soldier and statesman stated the moral is to the physical as three is to one Patton thought the Frenchman underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more important in battle than physical strength Our enemies are willingbetter said anxiousto give their lives for their cause How

out this article about Tuberville that was published today Bryan Taken from the Mobile Register Tub doing a lousy job Walking into Tiger Stadium at dusk Saturday amidst a whiskey river of LSU fans a friend looked at me and screamed over the cacophony of chants I dont know what to make out of this game he said I dont know if Im going to be more upset if we Auburn win or we get blown out again imagesspacergif The meaning was clear Under Thomas Hawley Tuberville you never really know what you will find under the big tent whether Dr Jeckyl or Mr Hyde Well after three hours in the sea of debauchery better known as Death Valley where fans chomping Tuberville induced cigars and yelling profanities and vulgarities it became crystalline where the state of Auburn football lies right now Under water Perhaps the most amazing conclusion of the long evening on the Bayou is the Auburn football program actually has accomplished something I never dreamed possible It showed less class than the LSU fans who have earned a reputation as some of the worst in college football I had to laugh afterwards when Tuberville with a straight face he is a riverboat gambler after all talked about this program exceeding expectations with a record Give me a break I picked Auburn to go in this space on Aug and so did many others Of course nobody predicted this team would mail in several games without any effort On Saturday night this football coaching staff was like the gang that couldnt shoot straight A national television audience witnessed some of dumbest coaching decisions ever What a total lack of class for the Auburn players to be dancing on the LSU logo before the game What has this group accomplished other than winning a trip to a bowl game that no one cares about What about the totally classless act of the kicking team getting in the way of the LSU marching band at the end of halftime One is tempted to criticize the players But in the end you really cant They are just a manifestation of a head football coach whose fratboy smile about everything and inability to get the bigger pictures has a trickle down effect on everyone especially the players Tuberville always talks doeeyed about his mentor Jimmy Johnson Apparently some of the Johnson mystique has really rubbed off when it comes to classlessness and thug behavior Tuberville loses by to Alabama and instead of taking the blame he makes fun of the opposing coach for starting the wrong quarterback all year Nine days later he finally apologizes to the Auburn family that is in a mea culpa that reeked of Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair This is a head football coach being paid million a year But if you think Tuberville earned his money this year think again And word is he cant believe the unhappiness in the ranks He wonders how people can turn on him after the job he has done What has he done In three years he has gone and now Add it up Bob Davie got fired Sunday for going at Notre Dame Of course among those wins are victories against Appalachian State Idaho Central Florida Wyoming Northern Illinois Ball State Louisiana Tech twice and Vanderbilt twice Thats a total of wins against an industrialsized pack of creampuffs So in legitimate games he is actually Tub is against Alabama lifetime and in the last games managed to lose five by double digits Florida by Syracuse by Arkansas by Alabama by and LSU by Does that give some clue there is a problem Of those losses Tub has suffered at Auburn have been by double digits At Ole Miss Tubervilles overall record was Of the losses were double digits Among those wins Tuberville beat such heavyweights as Indiana State Tulane twice Memphis twice Idaho State VMI Arkansas State twice Central Florida SMU twice and Vanderbilt four times So if you look at it objectively the school was hampered by NCAA limitations against legitimate teams his record was Of his current squad Tuberville talks of them being young Well Tommy enough already please This is your third year If you cant stand the heat call your agent and tell him to find you a new job Im sure theres a big market for a coach who has done as lousy a job as he has in the past few weeks The funniest rumor last week going concerned Tub replacing Nick Saban of LSU they share the same agent believed to be heading to the Indianapolis Colts Based on what I heard Saturday night in the Bayou LSU fans would burn Tiger Stadium to a crisp before accepting Tub as their head coach Assuming Tub graces Auburn with his presence next season everyone please cross your fingers in unison and hold your breath he faces a critical recruiting class and pivotal slate of games I still think he is a capable head coach But things must change Before the Iron Bowl there was a lot of talk about how the pendulum in the state had shifted And the prognosticators were correct Except they missed one important element The pendulum has shifted in this series toward Alabama Despite all the hardship and distractions Dennis Franchione appears to have Alabama heading in the right direction on all sides of the ledger including style and class Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Tommy Tuberville and his Auburn football program Paul Finebaums column appears Tuesday and Saturday in the Mobile Register Part File Part spacergif File spacergif

address the BalancingWheeling and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility My Nicor

through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility My Nicor rep faxed me copies of their tariff effective July stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation so Im a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually Any assistance with this would be

Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these

Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x

Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin

ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an

discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give

follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity

no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to

liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color Patrick Tucker

Goodell Scott Jones David Kaiser Jared Loving Scott Bates Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x

David Kaiser Jared Loving Scott Bates Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Tucker Patrick McCaffrey Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color Patrick Tucker
