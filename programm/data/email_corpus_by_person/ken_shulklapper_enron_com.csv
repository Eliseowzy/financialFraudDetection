May El Paso Energy was facing ruin It was the mids and Californias energy overseers were sure deregulation was going to drive the cost of natural gas through the floor So Pacific Gas and Electric Co with the happy acquiescence of the state dumped a huge longterm gas contract with El Paso For the state the decision was a nobrainer PGE was buying more space on gas pipelines than it needed For El Paso though it was a disaster The company started handing out pink slips like they were candy But in the long run it wasnt El Paso that would end up on its knees It would be PGE and the state of California That pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would soon become precious and El Paso led by a lawsharp chairman with bareknuckle smarts would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in the world So big in fact that in the eyes of vengeanceminded lawmakers and regulators El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to be plagued by rolling blackouts and skyhigh energy bills They didnt mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow back then said Randy Wu an El Paso manager then And now well lets just say they should have planned better Its not like El Paso was some new kid on the block The company was founded in Texas in and stayed a local concern until when it laid out miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California It grew steadily from there until when the US Supreme Court decided El Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in the Northwest That set off a long tumble that William Wise who had started at the company as a general counsel in set out to reverse when he took over as president in Wise a yearold whose lean build reflects both his passion for running and his reputation for driving himself hard is a rare bird in the world of oil The University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal side of his litigious industry as he once called it and its hardball economic strategies skills he honed by surfing the bustboom cycles of his business at its epicenter Texas Those skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PGE in and PGE had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the Arizona ghost town of Topock enough to import a whopping billion cubic feet of natural gas a day The trouble for El Paso was that when PGE dropped the contract for the pipeline space million of the companys annual revenue was erased It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast said Wu the former El Paso manager Of course California didnt care at all But Patrick Power the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline companys case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in could see trouble looming for the state If PGE and other utilities didnt keep the pipeline capacity to meet future needs he warned they would probably regret it later His words fell on deaf ears The mentality at the PUC PGE and Southern California Gas was This will be El Pasos problem Power said Wise reacted to the loss of the PGE contract by taking no salary himself for a year and freezing his executives pay Wu said While laying off more than onethird of the companys workers he and his staff negotiated a hefty settlement from PGE and other companies in exchange for their having dropped the pipeline space Then Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company so he had to get creative Wu said of Wise who has declined interview requests from The Chronicle Attorneys generally dont have a lot of common sense in my mind but Bill hes got extra said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis He cuts his losses in a hurry and he recognizes when he has to move on And so he moved Within a few years Wise stretched the now Houstonbased company to full wellhead to wire operations running everything from natural gas drilling to electric generation plants Before El Paso embarked on this expansion California constituted fully twothirds of El Pasos natural gas sales much of that to PGE The strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso El Paso would make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would never be dependent on one market again Wises company scooped up interests in electric power plants in states by April Along the way it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline companies to spread the El Paso reach along miles of pipe nationwide from Bakersfield to Boston The company was a very traditional gas company until then said Fred Pickel a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the s Wise though understands the streetlevel complexities of the business and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was able to see But some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those possibilities took unfair advantage of California In his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC staff attorney Harvey Morris thought he smelled a rat as long as three years ago Morris a natty yearold graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law takes on the look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El Paso and hes been carrying that look a long time now After losing PGE El Paso leased the utilitys entire block of pipeline capacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant Dynegy Gas experts were stunned that one firm would bid for all that space but they and Morris were even more surprised by what followed Dynegy didnt behave the way PGE and California officials had expected energy companies to behave in the era of deregulation Like PGE Dynegy didnt need all that pipeline space to serve its own customers But unlike what PGE did when confronted with all that extra space Dynegy didnt resell it at a huge discount In fact Dynegy didnt sell any of the space Instead it raised the price so high that seemingly nobody wanted to buy it Competing gas marketers were alarmed They suspected that Dynegy was collaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into California so prices would rise Great for anyone with space reserved on the pipeline but disastrous for those left out in the cold In having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing on the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive Morris filed the first of many complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hes still pursuing them As it turned out spot prices didnt rise while Dynegy held the contract gas shippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money Dynegy let the contract lapse in late Not long afterward the pipeline contract wound up with El Pasos market affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy And thats when things started to get really serious Morris says El Pasos own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into Southern California than any other trader by far just as the demand for gas was about to soar In his many filings in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California Edison and others Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented pipeline space from being used They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves the prices went through the roof he said It was the same as closing off part of the pipeline El Paso officials for their part say market rates started soaring in simply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply They say they never charged more than what industry rules allowed and that attempts to prove otherwise are preposterous And thus far except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities the freemarketminded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the company did anything wrong though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow on the latest allegations filed by PGE Edison and the PUC Edison estimates that El Pasos manipulation at Topock jacked up rates all over the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay billion more than they should have just in the past year Whatever the reason the bottom line is that gas prices in California have been anywhere from two to times as expensive as on the other side of the border in Arizona and in almost every other state Once prices started to rise at Topock gas marketers throughout California followed suit and the ripple spread quickly Gas prices for consumers started going up The rise also propelled electricity costs skyward because three out of every five electricity plants in California run on natural gas The firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the utilities like PGE which had shed many of their own plants as part of deregulation The problem for PGE and other utilities is that they couldnt pass those higher electricity costs on to their customers because electricity rates were still regulated So the red ink started to gush in the hundreds of millions of dollars And with gas prices still higher here than anywhere else it is still gushing But not for El Paso El Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in to become not just a survivor but a billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of the energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States The company renamed El Paso Corp this February is now practically printing money The companys revenue shot from billion in to billion last year its profit last year alone was million its highest ever Wises compensation package reportedly totaled million And its not just with gas that El Paso is making its money Among its holdings are small power plants serving PGE and Southern California Edison Under El Pasos contracts the price of that electricity automatically rises when the price of gas rises Thats true even at the power plants that dont use any natural gas All told in just a bit more than one year alone consultants for Edison say El Paso earned an extra million thanks to electricity produced by those plants And all this is blossoming for El Paso while PGE wallows in bankruptcy court billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight The one cloud on El Pasos horizon A host of California legislators industry experts and state regulators suspect that El Pasos sunny profit picture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El Pasos natural gas pipeline that PGE had been so happy to surrender The hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow and just last month the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top El Paso executives but not Wise to Sacramento to testify on the matter It was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state And though the executives grimly waved off reporters questions as they strode from the room company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that the accusations will blow over because theres nothing to them The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than years and we want to continue being here Dunn said We take this matter very seriously We want to be cooperative Accusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline space hostage amount to nothing but conspiracy theories she said The Assembly panel however concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had manipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers The numbers tell the truth the subcommittee said in a report obtained by The Chronicle The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators and bureaucrats or explained away by corporate lawyers wordplay The report was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans Wise when he addresses the accusations says he is mystified why state lawmakers are mad He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading here and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport When it comes to California El Paso has always tried to be a part of the solution not the problem he told a gas industry newsletter in December State lawmakers attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have been met with resistance from the company which calls them proprietary information And judging by Morris experience chasing El Paso to the ground may take the Legislature quite a while if thats what it decides it wants to do Morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up The Assembly subcommittees report was scathing in regard to the commission saying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts raises serious questions about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates The commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused to comment on its rulings By the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May opening the crucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition for the first time in more than three years it will be far too late Morris said The damage was done long ago Morris said The state and its utilities are on the hook for billions in debt money for last winters bills has already left consumers pockets and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come down soon The market got set and now were in trouble Morris said PGE for its part sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim The utility had paid million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from to and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover million of that through customer rates And in the PUC and ratepayers were clamoring for lower power bills and there was a huge amount of pipeline space in the state that wasnt being used So when youre trying to cut costs what better to cut than something you dont need said Dan Thomas PGEs director of gas transmission I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity he said Still theres no denying the numbers At latest count PGE owed El Paso more than million for gas and electricity As Morris sees it El Paso is this big pound gorilla at the border and can limit supplies as they wish Its outrageous and there wasnt a thing anybody could do to stop them El Paso officials of course put it differently All we did was good business smart business and people keep dishing dirt about us but we just dont see ourselves in it company spokesman Mel Scott said Its pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this faulty deregulation system and if PGE and Southern California utilities had been in their right minds and signed up for longterm natural gas contracts back in and they wouldnt be in this trouble Nobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating but pleasure over the turn of events is never far from the surface Those who can speak more freely dont mind putting the boot in a bit Everything bad thats happening right now in the pipeline fight could have been prevented if PGE just hadnt gotten rid of that contract back then Wu said But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that In fact I have yet to hear anyone even at PGE say that and thats sad What it all comes down to is this El Paso figured out how to play Californias energy game better than California Those laws your boys passed there in California well they just left you wide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit said Tom Smitty Smith director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen a consumer rights group You cant fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and put the bale right in front of its face now can you Californias energy island There are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into energystarved California The main one owned by El Paso is at the Colorado River The pipelines originate in the Southwest They wind miles through several states to pop up right where Route used to cut over the Colorado River on its famous arched steel bridge Today two of El Pasos pipelines are all that use the old bridge Kenneth Shulklapper Media Risk Management Enron

have yet to hear anyone even at PGE say that and thats sad What it all comes down to is this El Paso figured out how to play Californias energy game better than California Those laws your boys passed there in California well they just left you wide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit said Tom Smitty Smith director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen a consumer rights group You cant fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and put the bale right in front of its face now can you Californias energy island There are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into energystarved California The main one owned by El Paso is at the Colorado River The pipelines originate in the Southwest They wind miles through several states to pop up

<9991707.1075855606951.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ken.shulklapper@enron.com,2001-05-13 06:31:00,Interesting ArticleTexas firm outfoxed state PGE Kevin Fagan Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday May El Paso Energy was facing ruin It was the mids and Californias energy overseers were sure deregulation was going to drive the cost of natural gas through the floor So Pacific Gas and Electric Co with the happy acquiescence of the state dumped a huge longterm gas contract with El Paso For the state the decision was a nobrainer PGE was buying more space on gas pipelines than it needed For El Paso though it was a disaster The company started handing out pink slips like they were candy But in the long run it wasnt El Paso that would end up on its knees It would be PGE and the state of California That pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would soon become precious and El Paso led by a lawsharp chairman with bareknuckle smarts would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in the world So big in fact that in the eyes of vengeanceminded lawmakers and regulators El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to be plagued by rolling blackouts and skyhigh energy bills They didnt mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow back then said Randy Wu an El Paso manager then And now well lets just say they should have planned better Its not like El Paso was some new kid on the block The company was founded in Texas in and stayed a local concern until when it laid out miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California It grew steadily from there until when the US Supreme Court decided El Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in the Northwest That set off a long tumble that William Wise who had started at the company as a general counsel in set out to reverse when he took over as president in Wise a yearold whose lean build reflects both his passion for running and his reputation for driving himself hard is a rare bird in the world of oil The University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal side of his litigious industry as he once called it and its hardball economic strategies skills he honed by surfing the bustboom cycles of his business at its epicenter Texas Those skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PGE in and PGE had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the Arizona ghost town of Topock enough to import a whopping billion cubic feet of natural gas a day The trouble for El Paso was that when PGE dropped the contract for the pipeline space million of the companys annual revenue was erased It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast said Wu the former El Paso manager Of course California didnt care at all But Patrick Power the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline companys case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in could see trouble looming for the state If PGE and other utilities didnt keep the pipeline capacity to meet future needs he warned they would probably regret it later His words fell on deaf ears The mentality at the PUC PGE and Southern California Gas was This will be El Pasos problem Power said Wise reacted to the loss of the PGE contract by taking no salary himself for a year and freezing his executives pay Wu said While laying off more than onethird of the companys workers he and his staff negotiated a hefty settlement from PGE and other companies in exchange for their having dropped the pipeline space Then Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company so he had to get creative Wu said of Wise who has declined interview requests from The Chronicle Attorneys generally dont have a lot of common sense in my mind but Bill hes got extra said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis He cuts his losses in a hurry and he recognizes when he has to move on And so he moved Within a few years Wise stretched the now Houstonbased company to full wellhead to wire operations running everything from natural gas drilling to electric generation plants Before El Paso embarked on this expansion California constituted fully twothirds of El Pasos natural gas sales much of that to PGE The strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso El Paso would make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would never be dependent on one market again Wises company scooped up interests in electric power plants in states by April Along the way it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline companies to spread the El Paso reach along miles of pipe nationwide from Bakersfield to Boston The company was a very traditional gas company until then said Fred Pickel a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the s Wise though understands the streetlevel complexities of the business and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was able to see But some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those possibilities took unfair advantage of California In his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC staff attorney Harvey Morris thought he smelled a rat as long as three years ago Morris a natty yearold graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law takes on the look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El Paso and hes been carrying that look a long time now After losing PGE El Paso leased the utilitys entire block of pipeline capacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant Dynegy Gas experts were stunned that one firm would bid for all that space but they and Morris were even more surprised by what followed Dynegy didnt behave the way PGE and California officials had expected energy companies to behave in the era of deregulation Like PGE Dynegy didnt need all that pipeline space to serve its own customers But unlike what PGE did when confronted with all that extra space Dynegy didnt resell it at a huge discount In fact Dynegy didnt sell any of the space Instead it raised the price so high that seemingly nobody wanted to buy it Competing gas marketers were alarmed They suspected that Dynegy was collaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into California so prices would rise Great for anyone with space reserved on the pipeline but disastrous for those left out in the cold In having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing on the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive Morris filed the first of many complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hes still pursuing them As it turned out spot prices didnt rise while Dynegy held the contract gas shippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money Dynegy let the contract lapse in late Not long afterward the pipeline contract wound up with El Pasos market affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy And thats when things started to get really serious Morris says El Pasos own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into Southern California than any other trader by far just as the demand for gas was about to soar In his many filings in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California Edison and others Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented pipeline space from being used They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves the prices went through the roof he said It was the same as closing off part of the pipeline El Paso officials for their part say market rates started soaring in simply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply They say they never charged more than what industry rules allowed and that attempts to prove otherwise are preposterous And thus far except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities the freemarketminded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the company did anything wrong though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow on the latest allegations filed by PGE Edison and the PUC Edison estimates that El Pasos manipulation at Topock jacked up rates all over the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay billion more than they should have just in the past year Whatever the reason the bottom line is that gas prices in California have been anywhere from two to times as expensive as on the other side of the border in Arizona and in almost every other state Once prices started to rise at Topock gas marketers throughout California followed suit and the ripple spread quickly Gas prices for consumers started going up The rise also propelled electricity costs skyward because three out of every five electricity plants in California run on natural gas The firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the utilities like PGE which had shed many of their own plants as part of deregulation The problem for PGE and other utilities is that they couldnt pass those higher electricity costs on to their customers because electricity rates were still regulated So the red ink started to gush in the hundreds of millions of dollars And with gas prices still higher here than anywhere else it is still gushing But not for El Paso El Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in to become not just a survivor but a billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of the energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States The company renamed El Paso Corp this February is now practically printing money The companys revenue shot from billion in to billion last year its profit last year alone was million its highest ever Wises compensation package reportedly totaled million And its not just with gas that El Paso is making its money Among its holdings are small power plants serving PGE and Southern California Edison Under El Pasos contracts the price of that electricity automatically rises when the price of gas rises Thats true even at the power plants that dont use any natural gas All told in just a bit more than one year alone consultants for Edison say El Paso earned an extra million thanks to electricity produced by those plants And all this is blossoming for El Paso while PGE wallows in bankruptcy court billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight The one cloud on El Pasos horizon A host of California legislators industry experts and state regulators suspect that El Pasos sunny profit picture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El Pasos natural gas pipeline that PGE had been so happy to surrender The hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow and just last month the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top El Paso executives but not Wise to Sacramento to testify on the matter It was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state And though the executives grimly waved off reporters questions as they strode from the room company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that the accusations will blow over because theres nothing to them The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than years and we want to continue being here Dunn said We take this matter very seriously We want to be cooperative Accusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline space hostage amount to nothing but conspiracy theories she said The Assembly panel however concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had manipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers The numbers tell the truth the subcommittee said in a report obtained by The Chronicle The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators and bureaucrats or explained away by corporate lawyers wordplay The report was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans Wise when he addresses the accusations says he is mystified why state lawmakers are mad He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading here and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport When it comes to California El Paso has always tried to be a part of the solution not the problem he told a gas industry newsletter in December State lawmakers attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have been met with resistance from the company which calls them proprietary information And judging by Morris experience chasing El Paso to the ground may take the Legislature quite a while if thats what it decides it wants to do Morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up The Assembly subcommittees report was scathing in regard to the commission saying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts raises serious questions about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates The commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused to comment on its rulings By the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May opening the crucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition for the first time in more than three years it will be far too late Morris said The damage was done long ago Morris said The state and its utilities are on the hook for billions in debt money for last winters bills has already left consumers pockets and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come down soon The market got set and now were in trouble Morris said PGE for its part sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim The utility had paid million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from to and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover million of that through customer rates And in the PUC and ratepayers were clamoring for lower power bills and there was a huge amount of pipeline space in the state that wasnt being used So when youre trying to cut costs what better to cut than something you dont need said Dan Thomas PGEs director of gas transmission I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity he said Still theres no denying the numbers At latest count PGE owed El Paso more than million for gas and electricity As Morris sees it El Paso is this big pound gorilla at the border and can limit supplies as they wish Its outrageous and there wasnt a thing anybody could do to stop them El Paso officials of course put it differently All we did was good business smart business and people keep dishing dirt about us but we just dont see ourselves in it company spokesman Mel Scott said Its pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this faulty deregulation system and if PGE and Southern California utilities had been in their right minds and signed up for longterm natural gas contracts back in and they wouldnt be in this trouble Nobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating but pleasure over the turn of events is never far from the surface Those who can speak more freely dont mind putting the boot in a bit Everything bad thats happening right now in the pipeline fight could have been prevented if PGE just hadnt gotten rid of that contract back then Wu said But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that In fact I
