for Avoiding Litigation In our previous Littler ELert Emerging Trends Less Pretrial Dismissals of Employment Suits and More Trials we discussed the likelihood that federal courts will be more inclined to let juries decide employment discrimination cases Based on a recent Texas Supreme Court case Quantum Chemical Corp v Toennies Texas employers should anticipate the same tre nd in employment cases arising under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act TCHRA in Texas state courts Ralf Toennies worked for Quantum Chemical as an engineer A few m onths after he began to report to a new supervisor his performance reviews changed from being satisfactory to below expectations After Quantum fired Toennies for poor performance Toennies sued Quantum alleging that he was the victim of age discrimination At trial where the jury found no discrimination Toennies did not introduce any direct evidence of age discrimination Instead he attempted to prove discrimination by establishing that the employers reason for his termination poor performance was false or a pretext for discrimination Some of the coworkers called to testify at trial stated that Toennies was diligent and very competent The Texas Supreme Court held that this testimony an d his prior satisfactory performance appraisals which contradicted the employers explanation that Toennies was a poor performer was enough t o permit the trier of fact to find that the employer was actually motivated by discrimination The Court remanded the case for another trial with a new set of jury instructions to assess whether the employers decision was motivated by Toennies age In its analysis of the case the Court held that the question the jury should answer is whether the plaintiffs protected status age race sex etc was a motivating factor for the employment decision The plaintiffemployee does not have to prove that his or her protected status was the sole factor or the determining factor in the decision instead if the jury determines that the protected status was a motivating factor then the jury may decide that the plaintiff was the victim of illegal discrimination While this merely may seem to be only a difference in verbiage t he shift is significant The motivating factor standard is much different than proving that but for the protected status the employer would not have fired the employee The practical effect of the Courts decision is to increase the burden on the employer to show that it would have made the adverse employment decision regardless of the employees protected status This decision will make summary judgment in an employment case even more difficult to obtain in state court Even if a supervisor does not have an illegal motive for the termination if there is a scintilla of evidence th at casts doubt on the reason why the employee was terminated the employer s fate may be in the hands of the jury Accordingly before making a termination or other adverse employm ent decision we recommend that employersperform an exit interview with two persons other than the supervisor present to ascertain if the employee has any discrimination concerns Consider having the employee sign an acknowledgment documenting the topics discussed in the exit interview If the employee alleges disparate treatment the termination should be put on administrative hold until the issues have been investigated The employee need not be reinstated but the termination should not be made final until the investigation is completed Review termination decisions with counsel if necessary to assess the litigation risks Finally implement procedures to prevent hasty unauthorized termination decisions In addition to preventive measures employers should also examine all pleadings affirmative defenses and jury charges in pending TCHRA cases t o be certain that it has raised all defensive theories For example an employer may reduce damages if the employer can establish that it would ha ve made the same adverse employment decision regardless of the employees protected status Each lawsuit should be reviewed on casebycase basis to determine whether to raise that defense Texas Employment
