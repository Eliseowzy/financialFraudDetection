suppliers for capacity on the Crawford Lateral Duke and EPFS Planning has determined that the capacity of the Crawford lateral is MMcfd with current facility configurations The pipeline capacity is based upon several conditions WT max suction is psig to allow receipts from Maljamar Zia and Attoka on low pressure line to MLV Maximum operating discharge pressure at Crawford CS discharge is psig All receipts enter pipeline at end of lateral either through Crawford CS or into discharge and psig max operating discharge pressure is based upon Crawford CS being online The maximum capacity through Crawford compressor station as limited by current staging differential pressure and horsepower at psig discharge pressure is MMcfd typical suction pressure is about psig Having stated the above and regarding your request for a new EPFS interconnect EPFS crosses the Crawford lateral near the end of the lateral Therefore based on current firm obligations with Duke through Crawford CS at MMcfd and actual volumes of MMcfd TW could physically take EPFS volumes of MMcfd EPFS would need to have approximately to psig to get into TW line pressures anticipated near psig Or if EPFS chooses to firm up all MMcfd then Duke will be limited to MMcfd physical capacity through Crawford CS It is a battle of firm so however you slice it volumes is purely a commercial issue As promised the Level A cost estimate for connecting EPFS to the Crawford Lateral is Tax gross ups are not included This proposal includes the major items listed below The proposed facilities should be designed so that TW Gas Control has telemetry and full remote control of volumes or pressures Hot tap on Orifice measurement wEFM SCADA and control single tube Bristol FlowPressure control valving Fisher ED body Linear

Rich JollyET NRON Darrell SchoolcraftET NRON Subject EPFS Cost Estimate As I understand Bob is currently drafting agreements with Duke for firm capacity on the Crawford system that is pending Level B estimates for system modifications Current flows on the Crawford Lateral are around MMcfd The following modifications are proposed for Duke Add MM through Crawford Compressor for a total throughput of MMcfd no piping mods MMcfd of total is firm New connection is proposed for MMcfd on Crawford CS discharge for total Crawford Lateral flow of MMcfd New connection is proposed at junction for Duke receipt of MMcfd into Crawford Lateral for total Crawford Lateral flow of MMcfd this meets maximum flow conditions on Crawford Lateral due to pressure constraints to allow Duke to get in because of their available pressure at Crawford CS New connection for Duke into WT discharge for MMcfd Duke to provide its own compression and utilize parallel line to new connection Total Duke is proposing as supply to system via Crawford MMcfd Facility Planning does not provide Level B estimates we can however facilitate a Level B request from EngineeringConstruction which will take at least to days at this time Since this is just an interest at this point for EPFS Management consideration I strongly recommend that you let us provide a Level A cost estimate for your needs and we can get this to you before But it will only be an estimate for a tap and facilities Without further studies that will require additional time I assume that a MMcfd rate will probably back out volumes from Duke Crawford as related in note above As for a May initial delivery requested that would be highly unlikely due to the estimateapproval process and a number of purchase items on a facility this size that will have delivery expectations of at least eight weeks for example control valves chromatograph measurement devices The additional MM from EPFS and the Duke additions will require system modifications that may be extensive therefore we should all get together to get some clarifications and set objectives because one project will adversly effect the other regarding capacity constraints EF Forwarded by Eric

Field Services in Eddy County NM The current size of the interconnect is MMBtud Facility Planning has already provided Marketing with a Level B cost estimate to increase the size of this meter to accommodate up to MMBtud EPFS is now interested in a new interconnect with TW on the Crawford Lateral Please provide me with a cost estimate for a new receipt point meter for up to MMBtud between EPFS and TW in Eddy County NM EPFSs facilities cross TWs on the Crawford Lateral and would like to flow MMBtu to TW starting in May I need this estimate ASAP When will it be possible for Facility Planning to provide me with a Level B estimate EPFS wants it by to take to their management Thanks Lorraine Lindberg Account Executive Transwestern Pipeline Company

interconnect The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of MMcfd to ENA for power generating The problem is that the lateral capacity is about MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point but Citizens has about MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point Kevin is checking on this however I dont believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point two regulators can do more than MMcfd my intuitive guess needs to be checked or verified Pressure TW may be between psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca Citizens pressure is reported to be around psig downstream of control valves The greatest daily volume MN since Jan was Mcf on Jan as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas data The flow graph on Jan also obtained from MIPS is shown below Planning Question if Citizens meter capacity is say MMcfd at some pressure can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA What would new pressure conditions look like flowing MMcfd through the lateral Original Message From Eric Faucheaux Sent Thursday May PM To Eric Faucheaux Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Forwarded by Eric FaucheauxETSEnron on PM From David Roensch PM To Eric FaucheauxETSEnron Rich JollyET nron mailtoJollyET nron cc Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Eric Im going to try an provide the info requested this morning This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions The following are the details as I understand it The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points The other two interconnect points are Citizens FA interconnect In Flagstaff and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman Again one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points The total nomination is not to exceed mmcfd This mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point I hope that made sense So with that said as I understand it we must maintain the ability to provide mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery We have approximately miles of lateral from Transwesterns mainline feeding this interconnect Once at the metering station we have a auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree See chart below Please see drawing Flagstaff Lateral ICCUABA for details of meter station yard and piping Once the gas flows out of the turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater Citizens piping begins Citizens has ea regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail I know that pressure profiles in Section will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the Lateral would be but System Ops should be able to provide this info on a bestworst case senario both pre and post Red Rock Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station I would assume Flow Capacity Info for a Auto Adjust Turbine Meter Pressure Max Flow Rate mscfd mscfd mscfd mscfd The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated I hope this answered some of your questions It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning System Ops Marketing Engineering
