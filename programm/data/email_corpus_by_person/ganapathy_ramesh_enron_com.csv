Some of the issues have been addressed in the data grabber part of the web site and in RisktRAC This effort was started in September and yet to be completed It is prefered to have one source of data going out to all instead of multiple copies of the Access database We welcome feedback and reasonable time to incorporate these changes into the web functionality This group did not design the Access database In fact I personally have not even seen it We will be in the midst of NETCO test database setup NETCO data cleanup user creations RisktRAC migration Web migration and Unix migration to the

Sanvido Terry Brackett Debbie R White Stacey W Gossett Jeffrey C Reeves Kathy Postlethwaite John Ramesh Ganapathy Cc Subject RE Estate Testing Sunday Im going into a legacy database to pull data and Im having some problems ODBC connection to rmsprod failed The name of the database is ORMSDBSA This database was owned by an employee that is no longer with Enron Problem is that Jeff Gossetts team Kathy Reeves team John Postlethwaites team Stacey Whites team and Global ops used this database to query for daily reporting regarding traders VAR Either we need front end that can save query out for front end or we need a similar database for NETCO Im neutral however I think a similar database hook up would be quicker than front end solution Also have Jeff and Stacey been able to create the
