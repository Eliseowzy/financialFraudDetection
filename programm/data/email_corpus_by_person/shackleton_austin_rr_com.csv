<23781244.1075861578008.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shackleton@austin.rr.com,2001-11-15 19:08:21,Re smubetas Sad day for Auburn BetasNow Now Its not MY kind of thinking that lead anywhere Its stupid pledges with insufficient guidance from the leaders of the Auburn chapter that lead to this discussion The Leaders of the Beta chapter should have sent those guys packing immediately for their unfunny dress up But remember when Ted Danson dressed in blackface when he was dating Whoopi Goldberg The glitterati considered it poor taste and then dropped the whole issue almost immediately I cant claim to know the Greek diversity statistics at Auburn so I dont presuppose that the Black Fraternity has no whites nor that the other national fraternities have no blacks I do know that campus life has changed considerably in years that interracial dating and marriages are quite prevalent and the student bodies and their organizations including Greek are reflective of those changes The point still remains that the Black Fraternity is as racial isolated or perhaps even more racially isolated than probably any other campus organization Perhaps that is why they take such offense at the Beta stunt maybe even more offense than the situation warranted Original Message From aldentiii To Sent Thursday November PM Subject Re smubetas Sad day for Auburn Betas Brother Shackleton its your kind of thinking that lead to this discussion You know damn well the THE REASON that the Black fraternity with no white members exists on the Auburn campus is because there are none of the Miami Triad members or any other national fraternities on that campus who pledge Blacks So dont be so stupid with your inane comment about the fact that the Black fraternity has no white guys as members Before you stepped foot on the campus at SMU there was an occasion when there was a very sharp Black guy who registered for and came through rush Surprisingly there were several of us including yours truly an original New Orleans biggot of the highest magnitude who really were impressed with the guy and thought we should invite him back for the house party I remember vividly the incredible outlash when we stood before our brothers and tried to convince them to ignore the fact that this guy was Black We got hooted down and he was BALLED And I have no doubts after reading your immature remark that the same would have taken place during your tenure as an active at Gamma Omega So get a life Ace Its and counting How many Black brothers can you name from Gamma Omega kai Dick Dent Original Message From To Sent Thursday November PM Subject Re smubetas Sad day for Auburn Betas RE the important intermediary that will break the stranglehold on racism here The Betas might get one of white guys in the Black Frat to step in to help CARL HOHL on AM Please respond to To cc Subject Re smubetas Sad day for Auburn Betas alDentiii JaDrow I applaud your additions and input Hes right Woody And he doesnt need me to say that either but I wish I had thought of what he added first The BF Black Fraternity what are the Greek letters holds most of the cards in this scenario Therefore whoever the intermediary is is excruciatingly important visavis credibility with local Auburn parties as well as the National fraternities Bottom line Can everybody including the polkadotted people step outside of their stereotypical roles for a minute and make a statement to their unborn sons and daughters that racism of all colors ends with our generation Shocking coming from a Republican Or is this just another news story another missed opportunity After all we went to SMU for the same reason they are at Auburn now Most of us are or will be amused to look back at some of the unexpected sources of the lessons learned Can you tell that my profession is very close to this question more often than all of its members wish to admit The Less Diplomatic Brother Sarl Wed Nov aldentiii wrote Woody though Brother Carls suggestions have some merit I suggest that if you are going to get involved and talk to your sons actives that a little more diplomacy be considered I too have read many of the news reports about the incident and several were coupled with quotes from members of the Black fraternity aimed directly at the Betas rather than the Delta Sigs I think that any attempt on the part of the local former chapter members to approach the members of the Black fraternity for forgiveness will be met with outrage and will be rejected and blown up in the press in such a way as to make impossible a solution The chapter needs to find an intermediary who they can talk to and who has credibility with the Black fraternity They need to have a complete game plan to pitch to the intermediary who if convinced with their sincerity about their remorse in what happened will be willing to pitch their case to the Black fraternity in hopes of bringing about a meeting between representatives from the Beta chapter and the Black fraternity to iron out an agreement to resolve the dispute and to include the Black fraternity in supporting a petition to reinstate the chapters charter and probably with conditions which the Black fraternity will demand and which the Betas behind the eight ball cant negotiate away Unfortunately the Betas are not in a good bargaining position So whatever course they elect to take they will need to remember this They will have to eat a whole lot of humblepie to get that charter back kai Dick Dent aka the Deacon Original Message From woody berry To Sent Wednesday
