Associated with Bipolar Disorder Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers Zyprexac olanzapine Lilly provides better control of manic symptoms during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with valproate Depakotec Abbott according to new data presented today at the th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress ECNP in Munich The study is the first headtohead comparison of Zyprexa and valproate since the FDAs approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March Key Findings Dosing was based on both drugs package inserts see Study Design for more information The studys primary efficacy measure was the YoungMania Rating Scale YMRS an item scale used to assess the severity of a patients mania Key study endpoint findings included The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on the YMRS total score than did patients treated with valproate vs A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic symptoms defined as YMRS Total Score compared with valproate patients vs of patients on Zyprexa experienced a or more improvement in YMRS scores compared with of the valproate patients Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in certain YMRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients activityenergy vs sleep vs and languagethought disorder vs Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined by the YMRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment groups Study Design The threeweek randomized parallel doubleblind acutephase study examined hospitalized patients at sites who met the DSMIV criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of to mgday once daily or valproate in a flexible does range of to mgday multiple doses per day The mean ending dose for Zyprexa was mgday and the mean ending dose for valproate was mgday In addition plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of gmL the mean value of all levels obtained was gmL Clinicians determined dosing based on each patients clinical response as well as the blood levels in patients taking valproate Lorazepam use was restricted to a maximum dose of mgday and administration was prohibited within eight hours of a psychiatric exam Additional Study Results Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic or mixed patients In fact both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD However Zyprexa patients showed greater improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD scores vs The effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression Zyprexa was generally well tolerated The most common and significantly different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence vs for valproate dry mouth vs and increased appetite vs The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea vs for Zyprexa Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate can be obtained from their package inserts These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment option said Mauricio Tohen MD Dr PH medical adviser Lilly Research Laboratories Eli Lilly and Company and lead investigator for the study The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder a lifelong illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood Symptoms include abnormal elation andor irritability often accompanied by an unrealistic belief in ones own abilities increased sex drive delusions and alcohol or drug abuse People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed episodes marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring simultaneously Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV American Psychiatric Association Zyprexa olanzapine Lilly valproate Depakote Abbott The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproates recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration following reports of lifethreatening pancreatitis in both children and adults Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account said Carlos A Zarate MD associate professor of psychiatry and director bipolar and psychotic disorders program University of Massachusetts Medical Center The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for patients with bipolar disorder Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in shortterm clinical trials with schizophrenia patients It is also approved for the shortterm treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder In the original schizophrenia registration trials olanzapine was generally well tolerated However as with all medications olanzapine was associated with some side effects In the original sixweek acutephase schizophrenia trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dizziness weight gain constipation akathisia restlessness and postural hypotension Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically significantly different between olanzapine and placebo A small number of patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase none of these patients developed jaundice or druginduced hepatitis In shortterm three and fourweek acute bipolar mania trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dry mouth dizziness asthenia constipation dyspepsia increased appetite and tremor Lilly a leading innovationdriven corporation is developing a growing portfolio of bestinclass pharmaceutical products by

Associated with Bipolar Disorder Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers Zyprexac olanzapine Lilly provides better control of manic symptoms during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with valproate Depakotec Abbott according to new data presented today at the th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress ECNP in Munich The study is the first headtohead comparison of Zyprexa and valproate since the FDAs approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March Key Findings Dosing was based on both drugs package inserts see Study Design for more information The studys primary efficacy measure was the YoungMania Rating Scale YMRS an item scale used to assess the severity of a patients mania Key study endpoint findings included The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on the YMRS total score than did patients treated with valproate vs A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic symptoms defined as YMRS Total Score compared with valproate patients vs of patients on Zyprexa experienced a or more improvement in YMRS scores compared with of the valproate patients Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in certain YMRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients activityenergy vs sleep vs and languagethought disorder vs Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined by the YMRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment groups Study Design The threeweek randomized parallel doubleblind acutephase study examined hospitalized patients at sites who met the DSMIV criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of to mgday once daily or valproate in a flexible does range of to mgday multiple doses per day The mean ending dose for Zyprexa was mgday and the mean ending dose for valproate was mgday In addition plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of gmL the mean value of all levels obtained was gmL Clinicians determined dosing based on each patients clinical response as well as the blood levels in patients taking valproate Lorazepam use was restricted to a maximum dose of mgday and administration was prohibited within eight hours of a psychiatric exam Additional Study Results Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic or mixed patients In fact both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD However Zyprexa patients showed greater improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD scores vs The effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression Zyprexa was generally well tolerated The most common and significantly different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence vs for valproate dry mouth vs and increased appetite vs The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea vs for Zyprexa Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate can be obtained from their package inserts These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment option said Mauricio Tohen MD Dr PH medical adviser Lilly Research Laboratories Eli Lilly and Company and lead investigator for the study The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder a lifelong illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood Symptoms include abnormal elation andor irritability often accompanied by an unrealistic belief in ones own abilities increased sex drive delusions and alcohol or drug abuse People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed episodes marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring simultaneously Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV American Psychiatric Association Zyprexa olanzapine Lilly valproate Depakote Abbott The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproates recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration following reports of lifethreatening pancreatitis in both children and adults Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account said Carlos A Zarate MD associate professor of psychiatry and director bipolar and psychotic disorders program University of Massachusetts Medical Center The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for patients with bipolar disorder Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in shortterm clinical trials with schizophrenia patients It is also approved for the shortterm treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder In the original schizophrenia registration trials olanzapine was generally well tolerated However as with all medications olanzapine was associated with some side effects In the original sixweek acutephase schizophrenia trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dizziness weight gain constipation akathisia restlessness and postural hypotension Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically significantly different between olanzapine and placebo A small number of patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase none of these patients developed jaundice or druginduced hepatitis In shortterm three and fourweek acute bipolar mania trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dry mouth dizziness asthenia constipation dyspepsia increased appetite and tremor Lilly a leading innovationdriven corporation is developing a growing portfolio of bestinclass pharmaceutical products by

Associated with Bipolar Disorder Study is the largest comparison of two mood stabilizers Zyprexac olanzapine Lilly provides better control of manic symptoms during treatment of acute manic or mixed manic episodes compared with valproate Depakotec Abbott according to new data presented today at the th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress ECNP in Munich The study is the first headtohead comparison of Zyprexa and valproate since the FDAs approval of the use of Zyprexa for bipolar mania in March Key Findings Dosing was based on both drugs package inserts see Study Design for more information The studys primary efficacy measure was the YoungMania Rating Scale YMRS an item scale used to assess the severity of a patients mania Key study endpoint findings included The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on the YMRS total score than did patients treated with valproate vs A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic symptoms defined as YMRS Total Score compared with valproate patients vs of patients on Zyprexa experienced a or more improvement in YMRS scores compared with of the valproate patients Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in certain YMRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients activityenergy vs sleep vs and languagethought disorder vs Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined by the YMRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment groups Study Design The threeweek randomized parallel doubleblind acutephase study examined hospitalized patients at sites who met the DSMIV criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of to mgday once daily or valproate in a flexible does range of to mgday multiple doses per day The mean ending dose for Zyprexa was mgday and the mean ending dose for valproate was mgday In addition plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels were maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of gmL the mean value of all levels obtained was gmL Clinicians determined dosing based on each patients clinical response as well as the blood levels in patients taking valproate Lorazepam use was restricted to a maximum dose of mgday and administration was prohibited within eight hours of a psychiatric exam Additional Study Results Neither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic or mixed patients In fact both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD However Zyprexa patients showed greater improvement at the study endpoint in HAMD scores vs The effects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression Zyprexa was generally well tolerated The most common and significantly different adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence vs for valproate dry mouth vs and increased appetite vs The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea vs for Zyprexa Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate can be obtained from their package inserts These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment option said Mauricio Tohen MD Dr PH medical adviser Lilly Research Laboratories Eli Lilly and Company and lead investigator for the study The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively stabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder Manic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder a lifelong illness characterized by disruptive swings in mood Symptoms include abnormal elation andor irritability often accompanied by an unrealistic belief in ones own abilities increased sex drive delusions and alcohol or drug abuse People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed episodes marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring simultaneously Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV American Psychiatric Association Zyprexa olanzapine Lilly valproate Depakote Abbott The study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproates recent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration following reports of lifethreatening pancreatitis in both children and adults Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account said Carlos A Zarate MD associate professor of psychiatry and director bipolar and psychotic disorders program University of Massachusetts Medical Center The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety profile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for patients with bipolar disorder Zyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in shortterm clinical trials with schizophrenia patients It is also approved for the shortterm treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder In the original schizophrenia registration trials olanzapine was generally well tolerated However as with all medications olanzapine was associated with some side effects In the original sixweek acutephase schizophrenia trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dizziness weight gain constipation akathisia restlessness and postural hypotension Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen although mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically significantly different between olanzapine and placebo A small number of patients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase none of these patients developed jaundice or druginduced hepatitis In shortterm three and fourweek acute bipolar mania trials the most common treatmentemergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was somnolence Other common events were dry mouth dizziness asthenia constipation dyspepsia increased appetite and tremor Lilly a leading innovationdriven corporation is developing a growing portfolio of bestinclass pharmaceutical products by
