article saying the leader of the free world is now interested How is pm Easternpm Western as a standard time to have a weekly call What days work next week Ill send a message Monday with a date time and agenda after I hear from everyone including Jeff Dasovich who is away til then Rob August Clinton Seeks SteppedUp Probe Into Increasing Electricity Prices By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WASHINGTON The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators stepped up efforts to respond to a politically disastrous rise in California electricity prices threatening to go as far as reregulating some prices if they determine that the freemarket experiment in the state has failed The moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers scramble to come up with an expedient solution to high power prices in the San Diego area where monthly bills have in some cases quadrupled since last summer Workably Competitive In a page order issued Wednesday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that under the Federal Power Act it can intervene to limit the prices charged by generators to the California market if it determines the prices they are charging arent just and reasonable and the market is not workably competitive The order accompanied an upgrade of the FERCs effort from a staff probe to a formal investigation requested by President Clinton who also Wednesday extended million in federal emergency loans to lowincome residents in the San Diego area to help pay their electric bills There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets that threatens to erode the political consensus necessary to sustain a marketbased approach to regulation William Massey one of four FERC commissioners said Wednesday in an opinion attached to the order In these circumstances the FERC must act forcefully and decisively to insist that jurisdictional wholesale markets produce consumer benefits and just and reasonable rates As prices have risen power generators such as Duke Energy pjqquotecgisymduktypecompany Co the local utility San Diego Gas Electric Co and public officials have all pointed the finger at one another for what appears to be a badly flawed market California governor Gray Davis who is pushing for local legislation that would lower bills and accelerate powerplant construction Wednesday said outofstate generators were most responsible for bringing San Diego residents to their knees FERCs action Wednesday originated in a complaint filed Aug by San Diego Gas Electric a unit of Sempra Energy pjqquotecgisymsretypecompany the utility whose customers have raised the most outrage over the rate rises The utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use out of a statesanctioned auction passing those market costs directly through to its customers A Warning to Generators Steve Baum Sempra Energy chairman said FERCs action is a warning to generators that the prices theyve been receiving are now at risk He expects FERC to eventually issue a ruling that Californias market isnt competitive setting the stage for a possible return to costbased rates in periods of high demand Prior to deregulation in the rates utilities charged for electricity were based on their underlying cost Deregulation allowed them to charge whatever the market would bear Californias Governor Orders Regulators to Slash Electric Rates in Southern Areas Aug Mr Clinton said the FERC investigation would allow Washington to better understand what is happening in the California market so the government can protect consumers there and in other deregulated states While politicians and regulators seek solutions wholesale power prices in California are becoming more aberrant Even on days when consumption and prices normally drop such as Sundays prices have been stubbornly high this summer For example the auction price of electricity to be consumed at pm last Sunday was per megawatt or more than four times the price such power commanded on the third Sunday of August in The markup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on that day was lower than on the comparable day a year earlier A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out whats going on says Jesus Arredondo spokesman for the statesanctioned entity that runs the states dayahead energy auction the California Power Exchange in Pasadena Calif These prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials For instance the organization that runs the states electric grid and is responsible for keeping consumers constantly supplied with electricity has reduced the maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to per megawatt hour from While this action has capped peak prices it has also caused an increase in the overall number of hours in which prices are abnormally high Take Wednesday for instance Prices for power in California never dropped below per megawatt hour even for power contracted for delivery in the dead of night and the hourly price was at or above in of hours despite only moderately high demand Californias problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass omnibus legislation which would provide uniform national rules for deregulated state energy markets and make more efficient the interstate powertransmission system Mr Clinton said Wednesday The administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the legislation still appears deadlocked on the details It plans to hold a hearing in California on electricitymarket conditions there next month Marc Lifsher contributed to this article Write to Rebecca

article saying the leader of the free world is now interested How is pm Easternpm Western as a standard time to have a weekly call What days work next week Ill send a message Monday with a date time and agenda after I hear from everyone including Jeff Dasovich who is away til then Rob August Clinton Seeks SteppedUp Probe Into Increasing Electricity Prices By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WASHINGTON The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators stepped up efforts to respond to a politically disastrous rise in California electricity prices threatening to go as far as reregulating some prices if they determine that the freemarket experiment in the state has failed The moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers scramble to come up with an expedient solution to high power prices in the San Diego area where monthly bills have in some cases quadrupled since last summer Workably Competitive In a page order issued Wednesday the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that under the Federal Power Act it can intervene to limit the prices charged by generators to the California market if it determines the prices they are charging arent just and reasonable and the market is not workably competitive The order accompanied an upgrade of the FERCs effort from a staff probe to a formal investigation requested by President Clinton who also Wednesday extended million in federal emergency loans to lowincome residents in the San Diego area to help pay their electric bills There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets that threatens to erode the political consensus necessary to sustain a marketbased approach to regulation William Massey one of four FERC commissioners said Wednesday in an opinion attached to the order In these circumstances the FERC must act forcefully and decisively to insist that jurisdictional wholesale markets produce consumer benefits and just and reasonable rates As prices have risen power generators such as Duke Energy pjqquotecgisymduktypecompany Co the local utility San Diego Gas Electric Co and public officials have all pointed the finger at one another for what appears to be a badly flawed market California governor Gray Davis who is pushing for local legislation that would lower bills and accelerate powerplant construction Wednesday said outofstate generators were most responsible for bringing San Diego residents to their knees FERCs action Wednesday originated in a complaint filed Aug by San Diego Gas Electric a unit of Sempra Energy pjqquotecgisymsretypecompany the utility whose customers have raised the most outrage over the rate rises The utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use out of a statesanctioned auction passing those market costs directly through to its customers A Warning to Generators Steve Baum Sempra Energy chairman said FERCs action is a warning to generators that the prices theyve been receiving are now at risk He expects FERC to eventually issue a ruling that Californias market isnt competitive setting the stage for a possible return to costbased rates in periods of high demand Prior to deregulation in the rates utilities charged for electricity were based on their underlying cost Deregulation allowed them to charge whatever the market would bear Californias Governor Orders Regulators to Slash Electric Rates in Southern Areas Aug Mr Clinton said the FERC investigation would allow Washington to better understand what is happening in the California market so the government can protect consumers there and in other deregulated states While politicians and regulators seek solutions wholesale power prices in California are becoming more aberrant Even on days when consumption and prices normally drop such as Sundays prices have been stubbornly high this summer For example the auction price of electricity to be consumed at pm last Sunday was per megawatt or more than four times the price such power commanded on the third Sunday of August in The markup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on that day was lower than on the comparable day a year earlier A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out whats going on says Jesus Arredondo spokesman for the statesanctioned entity that runs the states dayahead energy auction the California Power Exchange in Pasadena Calif These prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials For instance the organization that runs the states electric grid and is responsible for keeping consumers constantly supplied with electricity has reduced the maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to per megawatt hour from While this action has capped peak prices it has also caused an increase in the overall number of hours in which prices are abnormally high Take Wednesday for instance Prices for power in California never dropped below per megawatt hour even for power contracted for delivery in the dead of night and the hourly price was at or above in of hours despite only moderately high demand Californias problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass omnibus legislation which would provide uniform national rules for deregulated state energy markets and make more efficient the interstate powertransmission system Mr Clinton said Wednesday The administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the legislation still appears deadlocked on the details It plans to hold a hearing in California on electricitymarket conditions there next month Marc Lifsher contributed to this article Write to Rebecca
