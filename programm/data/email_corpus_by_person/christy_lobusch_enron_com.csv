Oslo Credit Watch Report Lets discuss when Minna returns next Monday Simply providing the exposure relative to credit lines does not indicate that the next transacti on is credit approved and I am concerned that this would be construed as such Because positions are volatile the tenor and size of the next transaction also determine approval As well contractual terms play a rol e in the approval of the next transaction For example with margining right s above a contractual level exposure can be actively managed Clearly a re al time approach which capture exposure and potential exposure against sof t and contractual lines would be ideal Senior management in RAC is aware of this objective and efforts are underway to improve systems towards this end Nevertheless if you think that a CreditWatch list would assist the commercial team in managing credit risk in this market I am sure that some report could be generated periodically Rod Original Message From Lobusch Christy Sent June To Nelson Roderick Taponen Minna Subject RE Oslo Credit Watch Report Dear RodMinna Thank you for the response I apologize for the confusion I understand what is being said about the allocation of resources but how is commercial informed when a counterparty is approaching their credit limit I think th e finding is that a realtime credit system would be ideal but that the current IT environment does not support it I think that what is being sai d is that commercial should understand where counterparties stand before the trading day starts Or even if just the report lists those counterparties which are approaching their limits Is that something that is easily pulle d together on a daily basis Please advise Thanks Christy Lobusch Forwarded by Christy LobuschNAEnron on AM From Roderick

perfectly honest I had assumed that Minna Taponen who manages credit risk for Nordic was copied on the correspondence We should probably speak to clarify on issues but bel ow is my initial comment Currently credit is managed on a preapproval consent basis No counterpar ty is approved until the commercial team has made such a request and a review is performed and lines set This is not say that the rules are not occasionally violated but the credit approval system is in place RACCRM could generate a CreditWatch list but this would not necessarily improve t he process or reduce credit risk
