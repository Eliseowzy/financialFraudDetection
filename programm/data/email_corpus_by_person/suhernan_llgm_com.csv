with all of the mothers daughters sisters neices aunts and those who love these people Information is knowledge And knowledge is power An Internet friend sent this to me so I inturn am sending to all of you Ladies PLEASE take the time to read this It is a new form of breast cancer that we should all be aware of I hope you will forward this to all of your female friends RARE FORM OF BREAST CANCER In November I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer She developed a rash on her breast similar to that of young mothers who are nursing Because her mammogram had been clear the doctor treated her with antibiotics for infections After rounds and it continued to get worse her doctor sent her for another mammogram and this time it showed a mass A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy Chemo was started in order to shrink the growth then mastectomy then a full round of chemo then radiation After about months of intense treatment she was given a clean bill of health One year of living each day to its fullest then it returned to the liver area She took treatments and decided that she wanted quality of life not the after effects of chemo We had great months and she planned each detail of the final daysAfter just a few days of needing morphine she slipped away saying she had done what God had sent her into the world to do and now it was her time to go I still have tears as I write but her message is shown below PLEASEBe alert to any thing that is not normal and be persistent in getting help as soon as possible JUANITA BUSH Pagets Disease This is a rare form of breast cancer and is on the outside of the breast on the nipple and aureola It appeared as a rash which later became a lesion with a crusty outer edge I would not have ever suspected it to be breast cancer but it was My nipple never seemed any different to me butthe rash bothered me so I went to the doctor for that Sometimes it itched and was sore but other than that it didnt bother me It was just ugly and a nuisance and could not be cleared up with all the creams prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes just prior to this outbreak They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be cancerous Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast cancer Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola One of the biggest problems with Pagets disease of the nipple is that the symptoms appear to be harmless It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infection leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care What are the symptoms The symptoms include A persistent redness oozing and crusting of your nipple causing it to itch and burn As I stated mine did not itch or burn much and had no oozing I was aware of but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one side A sore on your nipple that will not heal Mine was on the aureola area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple Usually only one nipple is affected How is it diagnosed Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram of both breasts done immediately Even though the redness oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitis inflammation of the skin your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for cancer If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or suggest radiation treatments Had my doctor caught mine right away instead of flaking it off as dermatitis perhaps they could have saved my breast and it wouldnt have gone to my lymph nodes This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your friends as possible it could save someones life My breast cancer has spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of chemotherapy treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin If this had been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning perhaps it would not have spread TO ALL READERS This is sad as women are not aware of Pagets disease If by passing this around on the email we can make others aware of it and its potential danger we are helping women everywhere Please if you can take a moment to forward this message to as many people as possible especially to your family and friends It only takes a moment yet the results could save a life

with all of the mothers daughters sisters neices aunts and those who love these people Information is knowledge And knowledge is power An Internet friend sent this to me so I inturn am sending to all of you Ladies PLEASE take the time to read this It is a new form of breast cancer that we should all be aware of I hope you will forward this to all of your female friends RARE FORM OF BREAST CANCER In November I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer She developed a rash on her breast similar to that of young mothers who are nursing Because her mammogram had been clear the doctor treated her with antibiotics for infections After rounds and it continued to get worse her doctor sent her for another mammogram and this time it showed a mass A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy Chemo was started in order to shrink the growth then mastectomy then a full round of chemo then radiation After about months of intense treatment she was given a clean bill of health One year of living each day to its fullest then it returned to the liver area She took treatments and decided that she wanted quality of life not the after effects of chemo We had great months and she planned each detail of the final daysAfter just a few days of needing morphine she slipped away saying she had done what God had sent her into the world to do and now it was her time to go I still have tears as I write but her message is shown below PLEASEBe alert to any thing that is not normal and be persistent in getting help as soon as possible JUANITA BUSH Pagets Disease This is a rare form of breast cancer and is on the outside of the breast on the nipple and aureola It appeared as a rash which later became a lesion with a crusty outer edge I would not have ever suspected it to be breast cancer but it was My nipple never seemed any different to me butthe rash bothered me so I went to the doctor for that Sometimes it itched and was sore but other than that it didnt bother me It was just ugly and a nuisance and could not be cleared up with all the creams prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes just prior to this outbreak They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be cancerous Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast cancer Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola One of the biggest problems with Pagets disease of the nipple is that the symptoms appear to be harmless It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infection leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care What are the symptoms The symptoms include A persistent redness oozing and crusting of your nipple causing it to itch and burn As I stated mine did not itch or burn much and had no oozing I was aware of but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one side A sore on your nipple that will not heal Mine was on the aureola area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple Usually only one nipple is affected How is it diagnosed Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram of both breasts done immediately Even though the redness oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitis inflammation of the skin your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for cancer If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or suggest radiation treatments Had my doctor caught mine right away instead of flaking it off as dermatitis perhaps they could have saved my breast and it wouldnt have gone to my lymph nodes This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your friends as possible it could save someones life My breast cancer has spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of chemotherapy treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin If this had been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning perhaps it would not have spread TO ALL READERS This is sad as women are not aware of Pagets disease If by passing this around on the email we can make others aware of it and its potential danger we are helping women everywhere Please if you can take a moment to forward this message to as many people as possible especially to your family and friends It only takes a moment yet the results could save a life

with all of the mothers daughters sisters neices aunts and those who love these people Information is knowledge And knowledge is power An Internet friend sent this to me so I inturn am sending to all of you Ladies PLEASE take the time to read this It is a new form of breast cancer that we should all be aware of I hope you will forward this to all of your female friends RARE FORM OF BREAST CANCER In November I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer She developed a rash on her breast similar to that of young mothers who are nursing Because her mammogram had been clear the doctor treated her with antibiotics for infections After rounds and it continued to get worse her doctor sent her for another mammogram and this time it showed a mass A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy Chemo was started in order to shrink the growth then mastectomy then a full round of chemo then radiation After about months of intense treatment she was given a clean bill of health One year of living each day to its fullest then it returned to the liver area She took treatments and decided that she wanted quality of life not the after effects of chemo We had great months and she planned each detail of the final daysAfter just a few days of needing morphine she slipped away saying she had done what God had sent her into the world to do and now it was her time to go I still have tears as I write but her message is shown below PLEASEBe alert to any thing that is not normal and be persistent in getting help as soon as possible JUANITA BUSH Pagets Disease This is a rare form of breast cancer and is on the outside of the breast on the nipple and aureola It appeared as a rash which later became a lesion with a crusty outer edge I would not have ever suspected it to be breast cancer but it was My nipple never seemed any different to me butthe rash bothered me so I went to the doctor for that Sometimes it itched and was sore but other than that it didnt bother me It was just ugly and a nuisance and could not be cleared up with all the creams prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes just prior to this outbreak They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be cancerous Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast cancer Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola One of the biggest problems with Pagets disease of the nipple is that the symptoms appear to be harmless It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infection leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care What are the symptoms The symptoms include A persistent redness oozing and crusting of your nipple causing it to itch and burn As I stated mine did not itch or burn much and had no oozing I was aware of but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one side A sore on your nipple that will not heal Mine was on the aureola area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple Usually only one nipple is affected How is it diagnosed Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram of both breasts done immediately Even though the redness oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitis inflammation of the skin your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for cancer If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or suggest radiation treatments Had my doctor caught mine right away instead of flaking it off as dermatitis perhaps they could have saved my breast and it wouldnt have gone to my lymph nodes This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your friends as possible it could save someones life My breast cancer has spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of chemotherapy treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin If this had been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning perhaps it would not have spread TO ALL READERS This is sad as women are not aware of Pagets disease If by passing this around on the email we can make others aware of it and its potential danger we are helping women everywhere Please if you can take a moment to forward this message to as many people as possible especially to your family and friends It only takes a moment yet the results could save a life
