Subject This is the note I want you to distribute You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard Forwarded by Terence H ThornENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Terence H Thorn AM To Maureen ES cc Subject Maureen would you distribute this note Friday morning to everyone who participates in the Friday call ThanksT Again I find myself in a time zone Korea that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual only an email address that floats in space its a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year This certainly isnt inclusive for the global affairs group Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of activities from throughout the world in which the group participates At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas Although we continue to make the rounds to both gauge reactions to and promote our comments the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months The MITI schedule is November file comments December the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITIguidelines are official December submitted comments are made public December can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities Probably not until the Spring January The electric utilities publish their tariffs March the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing Still we dont expect many if any changes My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official dont do seminars do business Until we can actually test the system with a transaction were spinning our wheels Wrobels people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then its up to Hirl Nick and I to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations Thats when all of the obstacles the utilities throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible Were in for a long incremental battle I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences weve seen in Europe Prior to Tokyo I was asked to be at APECs energy working group meeting in Wellington The APEC Energy Ministers established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval The Ministers also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years to represent the US Energy industry We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation basically telling PTT there is life after death privatizationliberalization She did great and has the temperate Knowledge and style to get our meessage across Unfortunately to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence Barry Leay the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese Mexicans and Chinese We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work lost a little on the consultative process DOE was no help with a little more EWG controlinterference and kept energy services alive at least through Spring Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December to go over developments and plan for The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories You just assume energy is included The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period That was as of Wednesday Again Joe will know how it ended up The side meetings were excellent with Eisenstat the gaza project the Bolivia conservation planhes on the OPIC board and Suttons ABAC nomination Secretary Daly South America and Mack McLarty Mark Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay Mack did talk to Clinton about Blairs swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blairs key advisors Al will talk to him about his departure from the third way Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so Im sure he knocked them dead Kelly handled all the interviews and Ill look forward to hearing from her how it went Whats alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization Trade is no longer an economic issue its a social issue Eisenstat said it best We have five tasks as a governmment and industry an education effort about trade and it benefits we cant be defensive demystify the WTO it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enrons international success Well need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block weve got Chinas WTO agrement with the US After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues No one has any answers yet I continue to work with Shell and the NGOs to set up the US Trust fund for the million dollar Bolivian conservation plan The Associon de Hecht has cleared its legal review Its not going to happen until January We have also had an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno Meet with them find out if were really at fault and fix it I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone based in Bolivia She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone I will meet with Jim Broad way in December our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like well get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation If the holds its a great vistory that took a year to accomplish I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy Im on the SKEnron board and a new bid for some of KEPCOs genration They have just told us they want everyone to bid again Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes It looks like weve the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPGs from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true We got caught in a political p contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we dont start generating income well have to shut down or at least cut back Merrill Grimes and Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls Sue has everyones comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems With all the work we have done over the years weve never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for On the commercialside well start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale An internal trading system is inevitable We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen Weve created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houstons ozone problem Our next get together will be around the th I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israelis and others to move the project along Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt When I travelled with Daly last month I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza hoepfully to our projects Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy

New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at Flat Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion The suit which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington DC seeks classaction status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond Wash software giant The plaintiffs a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees The suit asks for at least billion of compensatory and punitive damages They have a plantationtype mentality when it comes to the treatment of AfricanAmerican employees at the company said Willie Gary the highprofile plaintiffs attorney bringing the suit who also is involved in a similar case against CocaCola Co It borders on corporate slavery Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he couldnt comment on the specifics of the suit but said We have a fairly strong track record of not tolerating discrimination in any of our employment practices The page complaint takes issue with otherwise ordinary interactions among Microsoft employees in contrast with some recent discrimination suits against other big corporations that featured accusations of abusive language toward black employees and of racist office displays including nooses and swastikas The suit alleges that some of the most widely replicated aspects of a New Economy workplace flat corporate hierarchies where workers can bypass managers and merit pay that isnt tied to an employees seniority allowed Microsoft to systematically discriminate against its AfricanAmerican employees The suit amends an existing action filed on behalf of Rahn Jackson an eightyear veteran of Microsofts Washington DC office who had led a team of employees selling software to the US military Mr Jackson claims that despite receiving solid scores on performance reviews he repeatedly was passed over for promotions that went to white employees Mr Jackson has since left Microsoft and now handles corporate sales for one of the companys biggest competitors Sun Microsystems Inc of Palo Alto Calif The case could foreshadow a wave of similar claims against other hightechnology companies especially if the sector sheds thousands of workers amid the slowing economy John C Fox who heads the employmentlaw practice at Palo Altos Fenwick West said his law firm has spent weeks readying layoff plans for Silicon Valley companies which are preparing for a major round of cuts slated for Monday He declined to name the companies But whenever there are layoffs lawsuits inevitably follow Mr Fox said There will be a lot of discrimination claims You can bet your bottom dollar on that he said He predicted though that because there are relatively few minorities working in Silicon Valley most discrimination claims will come from white male workers more than years old who are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Jackson suit against Microsoft focuses on the fact that at many companies including Microsoft managers are asked to grade their employees with the scores used in awarding promotions stock options and pay raises Many younger employees cherish such systems which allow skilled but relatively inexperienced workers to get paid more and rise faster than they would have under a traditional seniority system The subjective nature of such evaluations however could permit managers to discriminate against employees because of their race or age or sex as the plaintiffs in the Microsoft case allege Indeed Mr Jackson said in an interview that he and other black employees were being paid less than a third as much as comparably situated white employees and received fewer stock options Microsoft denies black employees were routinely paid less than their white counterparts though it refused to specifically address the suit saying personnel matters are confidential The suit also highlights the potential for controversy that exists when companies enact flat hierarchies designed to allow junior employees to freely interact with senior managers as a way to increase productivity and tear down barriers between workers Mr Jacksons suit for instance accuses Microsoft of fostering a hostile work environment by allowing a junior white employee to publicly challenge and defy him and to bypass him in the offices formal chain of command Microsofts Mr Ballmer however insisted his company has worked very hard to promote minority and women employees despite having to contend with a general shortage of engineering talent in the software industry Microsoft has invested more than million in initiatives to stimulate interest in science and technology among women and minorities he noted Rebecca Buckman contributed to this article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C TECHNOLOGY New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft By The New York Times The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees The suit filed in federal district court here builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D Jackson a former account executive for Microsoft Mr Jacksons complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs Mr Jackson said today at a news conference here that he had raised his concerns with Microsoft before filing his suit but that he received little response We really didnt want to have to be here today he said The plaintiffs are four former employees from Microsofts office in the District of Columbia and two former and one current employee at its headquarters in Redmond Wash The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who presided over the governments antitrust case against Microsoft and ordered the company to be split into two parts Microsoft which is appealing has argued that Judge Jackson committed substantive errors in the antitrust case Deborah Willingham vice president for human resources at Microsoft said the company was percent committed to diversity She declined to comment on the specific complaint because she had not reviewed it Willie E Gary a lawyer for the plaintiffs said at the news conference that Microsoft discriminated against black employees in evaluations compensation promotions and termination There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft he said Mr Gary who won a bias lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company last year also represents four plaintiffs in a pending discrimination suit against the CocaCola Company Mr Gary presented employment figures that he said supported the complaint In percent of the companys employees were black Mr Gary said and of the companys managers just percent were black Mr Gary said that he gathered the figures by speaking to Microsoft employees and from internal company documents Ms Willingham said that Microsoft has a zerotolerance policy toward discrimination in the workplace She added that We take any allegations of discrimination very seriously and immediately investigate any concern that is raised A company spokeswoman said that percent of Microsofts domestic work force of was black and that in the last three years there had been an percent increase in the number of black employees The percentage of all minority employees at the company has risen from percent in to about percent of the domestic work force today she said This is not the only lawsuit contending racial bias at Microsoft In October Monique Donaldson a former program manager for Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the company claiming racial and gender bias that lawsuit is pending in federal district court in Seattle And Peter Browne who had been Microsofts highestranking black executive before leaving the company in September filed a discrimination lawsuit shortly after his departure Photo Rahn

participate in the weekly call Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual only an email address that floats in space its a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year This certainly isnt inclusive for the global affairs group Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of activities from throughout the world in which the group participates At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas Although we continue to make the rounds to both gauge reactions to and promote our comments the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months The MITI schedule is November file comments December the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITIguidelines are official December submitted comments are made public December can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities Probably not until the Spring January The electric utilities publish their tariffs March the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing Still we dont expect many if any changes My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official dont do seminars do business Until we can actually test the system with a transaction were spinning our wheels Wrobels people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then its up to Hirl Nick and I to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations Thats when all of the obstacles the utilities throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible Were in for a long incremental battle I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences weve seen in Europe Prior to Tokyo I was asked to be at APECs energy working group meeting in Wellington The APEC Energy Ministers established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval The Ministers also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years to represent the US Energy industry We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation basically telling PTT there is life after death privatizationliberalization She did great and has the temperate Knowledge and style to get our meessage across Unfortunately to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence Barry Leay the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese Mexicans and Chinese We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work lost a little on the consultative process DOE was no help with a little more EWG controlinterference and kept energy services alive at least through Spring Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December to go over developments and plan for The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories You just assume energy is included The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period That was as of Wednesday Again Joe will know how it ended up The side meetings were excellent with Eisenstat the gaza project the Bolivia conservation planhes on the OPIC board and Suttons ABAC nomination Secretary Daly South America and Mack McLarty Mark Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay Mack did talk to Clinton about Blairs swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blairs key advisors Al will talk to him about his departure from the third way Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so Im sure he knocked them dead Kelly handled all the interviews and Ill look forward to hearing from her how it went Whats alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization Trade is no longer an economic issue its a social issue Eisenstat said it best We have five tasks as a governmment and industry an education effort about trade and it benefits we cant be defensive demystify the WTO it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enrons international success Well need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block weve got Chinas WTO agrement with the US After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues No one has any answers yet I continue to work with Shell and the NGOs to set up the US Trust fund for the million dollar Bolivian conservation plan The Associon de Hecht has cleared its legal review Its not going to happen until January We have also had an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno Meet with them find out if were really at fault and fix it I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone based in Bolivia She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone I will meet with Jim Broad way in December our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like well get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation If the holds its a great vistory that took a year to accomplish I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy Im on the SKEnron board and a new bid for some of KEPCOs genration They have just told us they want everyone to bid again Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes It looks like weve the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPGs from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true We got caught in a political p contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we dont start generating income well have to shut down or at least cut back Merrill Grimes and Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls Sue has everyones comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems With all the work we have done over the years weve never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for On the commercialside well start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale An internal trading system is inevitable We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen Weve created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houstons ozone problem Our next get together will be around the th I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israelis and others to move the project along Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt When I travelled with Daly last month I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure

New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at Flat Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion The suit which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington DC seeks classaction status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond Wash software giant The plaintiffs a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees The suit asks for at least billion of compensatory and punitive damages They have a plantationtype mentality when it comes to the treatment of AfricanAmerican employees at the company said Willie Gary the highprofile plaintiffs attorney bringing the suit who also is involved in a similar case against CocaCola Co It borders on corporate slavery Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he couldnt comment on the specifics of the suit but said We have a fairly strong track record of not tolerating discrimination in any of our employment practices The page complaint takes issue with otherwise ordinary interactions among Microsoft employees in contrast with some recent discrimination suits against other big corporations that featured accusations of abusive language toward black employees and of racist office displays including nooses and swastikas The suit alleges that some of the most widely replicated aspects of a New Economy workplace flat corporate hierarchies where workers can bypass managers and merit pay that isnt tied to an employees seniority allowed Microsoft to systematically discriminate against its AfricanAmerican employees The suit amends an existing action filed on behalf of Rahn Jackson an eightyear veteran of Microsofts Washington DC office who had led a team of employees selling software to the US military Mr Jackson claims that despite receiving solid scores on performance reviews he repeatedly was passed over for promotions that went to white employees Mr Jackson has since left Microsoft and now handles corporate sales for one of the companys biggest competitors Sun Microsystems Inc of Palo Alto Calif The case could foreshadow a wave of similar claims against other hightechnology companies especially if the sector sheds thousands of workers amid the slowing economy John C Fox who heads the employmentlaw practice at Palo Altos Fenwick West said his law firm has spent weeks readying layoff plans for Silicon Valley companies which are preparing for a major round of cuts slated for Monday He declined to name the companies But whenever there are layoffs lawsuits inevitably follow Mr Fox said There will be a lot of discrimination claims You can bet your bottom dollar on that he said He predicted though that because there are relatively few minorities working in Silicon Valley most discrimination claims will come from white male workers more than years old who are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Jackson suit against Microsoft focuses on the fact that at many companies including Microsoft managers are asked to grade their employees with the scores used in awarding promotions stock options and pay raises Many younger employees cherish such systems which allow skilled but relatively inexperienced workers to get paid more and rise faster than they would have under a traditional seniority system The subjective nature of such evaluations however could permit managers to discriminate against employees because of their race or age or sex as the plaintiffs in the Microsoft case allege Indeed Mr Jackson said in an interview that he and other black employees were being paid less than a third as much as comparably situated white employees and received fewer stock options Microsoft denies black employees were routinely paid less than their white counterparts though it refused to specifically address the suit saying personnel matters are confidential The suit also highlights the potential for controversy that exists when companies enact flat hierarchies designed to allow junior employees to freely interact with senior managers as a way to increase productivity and tear down barriers between workers Mr Jacksons suit for instance accuses Microsoft of fostering a hostile work environment by allowing a junior white employee to publicly challenge and defy him and to bypass him in the offices formal chain of command Microsofts Mr Ballmer however insisted his company has worked very hard to promote minority and women employees despite having to contend with a general shortage of engineering talent in the software industry Microsoft has invested more than million in initiatives to stimulate interest in science and technology among women and minorities he noted Rebecca Buckman contributed to this article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C TECHNOLOGY New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft By The New York Times The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees The suit filed in federal district court here builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D Jackson a former account executive for Microsoft Mr Jacksons complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs Mr Jackson said today at a news conference here that he had raised his concerns with Microsoft before filing his suit but that he received little response We really didnt want to have to be here today he said The plaintiffs are four former employees from Microsofts office in the District of Columbia and two former and one current employee at its headquarters in Redmond Wash The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who presided over the governments antitrust case against Microsoft and ordered the company to be split into two parts Microsoft which is appealing has argued that Judge Jackson committed substantive errors in the antitrust case Deborah Willingham vice president for human resources at Microsoft said the company was percent committed to diversity She declined to comment on the specific complaint because she had not reviewed it Willie E Gary a lawyer for the plaintiffs said at the news conference that Microsoft discriminated against black employees in evaluations compensation promotions and termination There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft he said Mr Gary who won a bias lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company last year also represents four plaintiffs in a pending discrimination suit against the CocaCola Company Mr Gary presented employment figures that he said supported the complaint In percent of the companys employees were black Mr Gary said and of the companys managers just percent were black Mr Gary said that he gathered the figures by speaking to Microsoft employees and from internal company documents Ms Willingham said that Microsoft has a zerotolerance policy toward discrimination in the workplace She added that We take any allegations of discrimination very seriously and immediately investigate any concern that is raised A company spokeswoman said that percent of Microsofts domestic work force of was black and that in the last three years there had been an percent increase in the number of black employees The percentage of all minority employees at the company has risen from percent in to about percent of the domestic work force today she said This is not the only lawsuit contending racial bias at Microsoft In October Monique Donaldson a former program manager for Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the company claiming racial and gender bias that lawsuit is pending in federal district court in Seattle And Peter Browne who had been Microsofts highestranking black executive before leaving the company in September filed a discrimination lawsuit shortly after his departure Photo Rahn

participate in the weekly call Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual only an email address that floats in space its a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year This certainly isnt inclusive for the global affairs group Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of activities from throughout the world in which the group participates At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas Although we continue to make the rounds to both gauge reactions to and promote our comments the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months The MITI schedule is November file comments December the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITIguidelines are official December submitted comments are made public December can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities Probably not until the Spring January The electric utilities publish their tariffs March the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing Still we dont expect many if any changes My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official dont do seminars do business Until we can actually test the system with a transaction were spinning our wheels Wrobels people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then its up to Hirl Nick and I to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations Thats when all of the obstacles the utilities throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible Were in for a long incremental battle I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences weve seen in Europe Prior to Tokyo I was asked to be at APECs energy working group meeting in Wellington The APEC Energy Ministers established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval The Ministers also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years to represent the US Energy industry We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation basically telling PTT there is life after death privatizationliberalization She did great and has the temperate Knowledge and style to get our meessage across Unfortunately to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence Barry Leay the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese Mexicans and Chinese We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work lost a little on the consultative process DOE was no help with a little more EWG controlinterference and kept energy services alive at least through Spring Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December to go over developments and plan for The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories You just assume energy is included The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period That was as of Wednesday Again Joe will know how it ended up The side meetings were excellent with Eisenstat the gaza project the Bolivia conservation planhes on the OPIC board and Suttons ABAC nomination Secretary Daly South America and Mack McLarty Mark Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay Mack did talk to Clinton about Blairs swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blairs key advisors Al will talk to him about his departure from the third way Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so Im sure he knocked them dead Kelly handled all the interviews and Ill look forward to hearing from her how it went Whats alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization Trade is no longer an economic issue its a social issue Eisenstat said it best We have five tasks as a governmment and industry an education effort about trade and it benefits we cant be defensive demystify the WTO it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enrons international success Well need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block weve got Chinas WTO agrement with the US After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues No one has any answers yet I continue to work with Shell and the NGOs to set up the US Trust fund for the million dollar Bolivian conservation plan The Associon de Hecht has cleared its legal review Its not going to happen until January We have also had an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno Meet with them find out if were really at fault and fix it I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone based in Bolivia She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone I will meet with Jim Broad way in December our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like well get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation If the holds its a great vistory that took a year to accomplish I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy Im on the SKEnron board and a new bid for some of KEPCOs genration They have just told us they want everyone to bid again Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes It looks like weve the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPGs from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true We got caught in a political p contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we dont start generating income well have to shut down or at least cut back Merrill Grimes and Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls Sue has everyones comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems With all the work we have done over the years weve never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for On the commercialside well start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale An internal trading system is inevitable We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen Weve created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houstons ozone problem Our next get together will be around the th I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israelis and others to move the project along Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso who made the short list on

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at Flat Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion The suit which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington DC seeks classaction status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond Wash software giant The plaintiffs a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees The suit asks for at least billion of compensatory and punitive damages They have a plantationtype mentality when it comes to the treatment of AfricanAmerican employees at the company said Willie Gary the highprofile plaintiffs attorney bringing the suit who also is involved in a similar case against CocaCola Co It borders on corporate slavery Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he couldnt comment on the specifics of the suit but said We have a fairly strong track record of not tolerating discrimination in any of our employment practices The page complaint takes issue with otherwise ordinary interactions among Microsoft employees in contrast with some recent discrimination suits against other big corporations that featured accusations of abusive language toward black employees and of racist office displays including nooses and swastikas The suit alleges that some of the most widely replicated aspects of a New Economy workplace flat corporate hierarchies where workers can bypass managers and merit pay that isnt tied to an employees seniority allowed Microsoft to systematically discriminate against its AfricanAmerican employees The suit amends an existing action filed on behalf of Rahn Jackson an eightyear veteran of Microsofts Washington DC office who had led a team of employees selling software to the US military Mr Jackson claims that despite receiving solid scores on performance reviews he repeatedly was passed over for promotions that went to white employees Mr Jackson has since left Microsoft and now handles corporate sales for one of the companys biggest competitors Sun Microsystems Inc of Palo Alto Calif The case could foreshadow a wave of similar claims against other hightechnology companies especially if the sector sheds thousands of workers amid the slowing economy John C Fox who heads the employmentlaw practice at Palo Altos Fenwick West said his law firm has spent weeks readying layoff plans for Silicon Valley companies which are preparing for a major round of cuts slated for Monday He declined to name the companies But whenever there are layoffs lawsuits inevitably follow Mr Fox said There will be a lot of discrimination claims You can bet your bottom dollar on that he said He predicted though that because there are relatively few minorities working in Silicon Valley most discrimination claims will come from white male workers more than years old who are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Jackson suit against Microsoft focuses on the fact that at many companies including Microsoft managers are asked to grade their employees with the scores used in awarding promotions stock options and pay raises Many younger employees cherish such systems which allow skilled but relatively inexperienced workers to get paid more and rise faster than they would have under a traditional seniority system The subjective nature of such evaluations however could permit managers to discriminate against employees because of their race or age or sex as the plaintiffs in the Microsoft case allege Indeed Mr Jackson said in an interview that he and other black employees were being paid less than a third as much as comparably situated white employees and received fewer stock options Microsoft denies black employees were routinely paid less than their white counterparts though it refused to specifically address the suit saying personnel matters are confidential The suit also highlights the potential for controversy that exists when companies enact flat hierarchies designed to allow junior employees to freely interact with senior managers as a way to increase productivity and tear down barriers between workers Mr Jacksons suit for instance accuses Microsoft of fostering a hostile work environment by allowing a junior white employee to publicly challenge and defy him and to bypass him in the offices formal chain of command Microsofts Mr Ballmer however insisted his company has worked very hard to promote minority and women employees despite having to contend with a general shortage of engineering talent in the software industry Microsoft has invested more than million in initiatives to stimulate interest in science and technology among women and minorities he noted Rebecca Buckman contributed to this article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C TECHNOLOGY New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft By The New York Times The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees The suit filed in federal district court here builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D Jackson a former account executive for Microsoft Mr Jacksons complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs Mr Jackson said today at a news conference here that he had raised his concerns with Microsoft before filing his suit but that he received little response We really didnt want to have to be here today he said The plaintiffs are four former employees from Microsofts office in the District of Columbia and two former and one current employee at its headquarters in Redmond Wash The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who presided over the governments antitrust case against Microsoft and ordered the company to be split into two parts Microsoft which is appealing has argued that Judge Jackson committed substantive errors in the antitrust case Deborah Willingham vice president for human resources at Microsoft said the company was percent committed to diversity She declined to comment on the specific

Sandra nron Paul CT Linda NRON Peggy ES Maureen nron cc Steven J nron Richard nron James D nron Subject California Power Failure Please see attached editorial which ran in yesterdays New York Times and is in todays Houston Chronicle We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy SF team Please distribute to all legislators trade and industry organizations etc Linda Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington Maureen Please distribute to the internal GA team Thanks kd Editorial Desk Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington Maureen Please distribute to the internal GA team Thanks kd Editorial Desk Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

This is the note I want you to distribute You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard Forwarded by Terence H ThornENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Terence H Thorn AM To Maureen ES cc Subject Maureen would you distribute this note Friday morning to everyone who participates in the Friday call ThanksT Again I find myself in a time zone Korea that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual only an email address that floats in space its a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year This certainly isnt inclusive for the global affairs group Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of activities from throughout the world in which the group participates At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas Although we continue to make the rounds to both gauge reactions to and promote our comments the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months The MITI schedule is November file comments December the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITIguidelines are official December submitted comments are made public December can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities Probably not until the Spring January The electric utilities publish their tariffs March the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing Still we dont expect many if any changes My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official dont do seminars do business Until we can actually test the system with a transaction were spinning our wheels Wrobels people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then its up to Hirl Nick and I to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations Thats when all of the obstacles the utilities throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible Were in for a long incremental battle I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences weve seen in Europe Prior to Tokyo I was asked to be at APECs energy working group meeting in Wellington The APEC Energy Ministers established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval The Ministers also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years to represent the US Energy industry We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation basically telling PTT there is life after death privatizationliberalization She did great and has the temperate Knowledge and style to get our meessage across Unfortunately to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence Barry Leay the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese Mexicans and Chinese We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work lost a little on the consultative process DOE was no help with a little more EWG controlinterference and kept energy services alive at least through Spring Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December to go over developments and plan for The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories You just assume energy is included The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period That was as of Wednesday Again Joe will know how it ended up The side meetings were excellent with Eisenstat the gaza project the Bolivia conservation planhes on the OPIC board and Suttons ABAC nomination Secretary Daly South America and Mack McLarty Mark Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay Mack did talk to Clinton about Blairs swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blairs key advisors Al will talk to him about his departure from the third way Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so Im sure he knocked them dead Kelly handled all the interviews and Ill look forward to hearing from her how it went Whats alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization Trade is no longer an economic issue its a social issue Eisenstat said it best We have five tasks as a governmment and industry an education effort about trade and it benefits we cant be defensive demystify the WTO it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enrons international success Well need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block weve got Chinas WTO agrement with the US After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues No one has any answers yet I continue to work with Shell and the NGOs to set up the US Trust fund for the million dollar Bolivian conservation plan The Associon de Hecht has cleared its legal review Its not going to happen until January We have also had an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno Meet with them find out if were really at fault and fix it I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone based in Bolivia She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone I will meet with Jim Broad way in December our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like well get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation If the holds its a great vistory that took a year to accomplish I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy Im on the SKEnron board and a new bid for some of KEPCOs genration They have just told us they want everyone to bid again Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes It looks like weve the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPGs from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true We got caught in a political p contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we dont start generating income well have to shut down or at least cut back Merrill Grimes and Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls Sue has everyones comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems With all the work we have done over the years weve never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for On the commercialside well start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale An internal trading system is inevitable We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen Weve created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houstons ozone problem Our next get together will be around the th I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israelis and others to move the project along Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt When I travelled with Daly last month I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza hoepfully to our projects Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at Flat Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion The suit which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington DC seeks classaction status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond Wash software giant The plaintiffs a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees The suit asks for at least billion of compensatory and punitive damages They have a plantationtype mentality when it comes to the treatment of AfricanAmerican employees at the company said Willie Gary the highprofile plaintiffs attorney bringing the suit who also is involved in a similar case against CocaCola Co It borders on corporate slavery Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he couldnt comment on the specifics of the suit but said We have a fairly strong track record of not tolerating discrimination in any of our employment practices The page complaint takes issue with otherwise ordinary interactions among Microsoft employees in contrast with some recent discrimination suits against other big corporations that featured accusations of abusive language toward black employees and of racist office displays including nooses and swastikas The suit alleges that some of the most widely replicated aspects of a New Economy workplace flat corporate hierarchies where workers can bypass managers and merit pay that isnt tied to an employees seniority allowed Microsoft to systematically discriminate against its AfricanAmerican employees The suit amends an existing action filed on behalf of Rahn Jackson an eightyear veteran of Microsofts Washington DC office who had led a team of employees selling software to the US military Mr Jackson claims that despite receiving solid scores on performance reviews he repeatedly was passed over for promotions that went to white employees Mr Jackson has since left Microsoft and now handles corporate sales for one of the companys biggest competitors Sun Microsystems Inc of Palo Alto Calif The case could foreshadow a wave of similar claims against other hightechnology companies especially if the sector sheds thousands of workers amid the slowing economy John C Fox who heads the employmentlaw practice at Palo Altos Fenwick West said his law firm has spent weeks readying layoff plans for Silicon Valley companies which are preparing for a major round of cuts slated for Monday He declined to name the companies But whenever there are layoffs lawsuits inevitably follow Mr Fox said There will be a lot of discrimination claims You can bet your bottom dollar on that he said He predicted though that because there are relatively few minorities working in Silicon Valley most discrimination claims will come from white male workers more than years old who are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Jackson suit against Microsoft focuses on the fact that at many companies including Microsoft managers are asked to grade their employees with the scores used in awarding promotions stock options and pay raises Many younger employees cherish such systems which allow skilled but relatively inexperienced workers to get paid more and rise faster than they would have under a traditional seniority system The subjective nature of such evaluations however could permit managers to discriminate against employees because of their race or age or sex as the plaintiffs in the Microsoft case allege Indeed Mr Jackson said in an interview that he and other black employees were being paid less than a third as much as comparably situated white employees and received fewer stock options Microsoft denies black employees were routinely paid less than their white counterparts though it refused to specifically address the suit saying personnel matters are confidential The suit also highlights the potential for controversy that exists when companies enact flat hierarchies designed to allow junior employees to freely interact with senior managers as a way to increase productivity and tear down barriers between workers Mr Jacksons suit for instance accuses Microsoft of fostering a hostile work environment by allowing a junior white employee to publicly challenge and defy him and to bypass him in the offices formal chain of command Microsofts Mr Ballmer however insisted his company has worked very hard to promote minority and women employees despite having to contend with a general shortage of engineering talent in the software industry Microsoft has invested more than million in initiatives to stimulate interest in science and technology among women and minorities he noted Rebecca Buckman contributed to this article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C TECHNOLOGY New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft By The New York Times The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees The suit filed in federal district court here builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D Jackson a former account executive for Microsoft Mr Jacksons complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs Mr Jackson said today at a news conference here that he had raised his concerns with Microsoft before filing his suit but that he received little response We really didnt want to have to be here today he said The plaintiffs are four former employees from Microsofts office in the District of Columbia and two former and one current employee at its headquarters in Redmond Wash The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who presided over the governments antitrust case against Microsoft and ordered the company to be split into two parts Microsoft which is appealing has argued that Judge Jackson committed substantive errors in the antitrust case Deborah Willingham vice president for human resources at Microsoft said the company was percent committed to diversity She declined to comment on the specific complaint because she had not reviewed it Willie E Gary a lawyer for the plaintiffs said at the news conference that Microsoft discriminated against black employees in evaluations compensation promotions and termination There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft he said Mr Gary who won a bias lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company last year also represents four plaintiffs in a pending discrimination suit against the CocaCola Company Mr Gary presented employment figures that he said supported the complaint In percent of the companys employees were black Mr Gary said and of the companys managers just percent were black Mr Gary said that he gathered the figures by speaking to Microsoft employees and from internal company documents Ms Willingham said that Microsoft has a zerotolerance policy toward discrimination in the workplace She added that We take any allegations of discrimination very seriously and immediately investigate any concern that is raised A company spokeswoman said that percent of Microsofts domestic work force of was black and that in the last three years there had been an percent increase in the number of black employees The percentage of all minority employees at the company has risen from percent in to about percent of the domestic work force today she said This is not the only lawsuit contending racial bias at Microsoft In October Monique Donaldson a former program manager for Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the company claiming racial and gender bias that lawsuit is pending in federal district court in Seattle And Peter Browne who had been Microsofts highestranking black executive before leaving the company in September filed a discrimination lawsuit shortly after his departure Photo Rahn

Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington Maureen Please distribute to the internal GA team Thanks kd Editorial Desk Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

Economy European Notebook Gas Liberalization Turns Volatile For German Utility By Philip Shishkin Staff Reporter The Wall Street Journal Europe Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Two years ago the municipal utility in Heidelberg Germany decided to do something very unusual for European utilities It went shopping for natural gas For more than years the utility Stadtwerke Heidelberg didnt have a choice in suppliers As with other large industrial buyers of natural gas in Europe it was locked into longterm supply contracts in its case with Ruhrgas AG and two other regional pipeline operators which own most of the natural gas pipelines in Germany and are regulated by German authorities But in the European Union moved to deregulate Europes natural gas market freeing factories utilities and other large industrial gas purchasers to forgo their traditional suppliers and look elsewhere The directive took effect in August So when Stadtwerke Heidelbergs latest contract expired it went shopping for gas one of the first German utilities to do so We wanted to show that its possible to get gas from another supplier said Peter Erb the utilitys manager of energy trading All the big players in the German market were saying its not possible As for his traditional suppliers Mr Erb said They were very angry In the end Stadtwerke Heidelberg succeeded in finding an alternative supplier but the utilitys troubles in the open market show just how difficult the process can be The utility and its new supplier Enron Corp of the US had to negotiate with Ruhrgas and the two other natural gas providers for six months before they could get access to transmission pipelines They also had to navigate through a confusing thicket of tariffs rules and technical requirements Although the EUs gas directive required pipeline owners to provide nondiscriminatory access to their system it didnt make clear how that would be done As many wouldbe gas suppliers quickly learned negotiating such access can be very tough The rules differ in different European nations and the pipeline owners can use the confusing regulations to their advantage to frustrate competitors So far there isnt the degree of competition that the industrial gas users expect from a liberalized market said Francesco Balocco energy issues manager at the European operations of Dow Chemical Co Energy consulting firm DriWefa recently surveyed large industrial gas buyers and found that while have sought new gas contracts only have switched suppliers The survey identified new entrants into the gassupply market including incumbent national players expanding in other EU countries and also large energytrading firms such as Enron Stadtwerke Heidelberg started its effort to diversify its naturalgas purchasing in December when it had just months remaining on its year contract Mr Erb picked up the phone and started calling potential suppliers and found the most interest at Enrons German headquarters The Houston Texasbased natural gas giant had grown explosively at home by competing for business against monopoly gas providers and it was looking to do the same abroad It took the two companies six months to secure access to pipelines in Germany Its absolutely natural for a network operator that is also competing in the supply market to try to keep us off the network said Paul Hennemeyer Enrons director of regulatory affairs Enrons officials ran into constant delays were asked to supply more and more information and sometimes even had a hard time reaching the right people at the companies they were negotiating with Mr Hennemeyer said Ruhrgas says it was trying to be helpful but argues that lengthy negotiations were inevitable because it was tackling many access issues for the first time We made every contribution to provide for fair and easy access network access said a Ruhrgas spokeswoman In the beginning the system needed some time to develop Shortly after a deal was reached the German government spelled out new rules on pipeline access which will make future negotiations easier In Oct Enron began to deliver gas to Stadtwerke Heidelberg and to another German municipal utility which followed a similar negotiating path Stadtwerke Heidelberg moved cautiously it bought of its natural gas from Enron with the remainder from its traditional suppliers Enron and Stadtwerke Heidelberg wont discuss the details of their contract though both say Enron offered a cheaper price than Stadtwerke Heidelbergs other suppliers But the German utility quickly absorbed the costsaving lessons of a deregulated market Starting in October the utility will drop Enron in favor of another company Wingas which has built a new pipeline to Heidelberg The reason a combination of a better price and the convenience of a new supply route We obviously didnt break out the Champagne Enrons Mr Hennemeyer recalls But he says Enron welcomes such switching of suppliers in general as a sign of the free market

breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nations power grid then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand they want to remove what they contend is a wire curtain around the South That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new federally supervised regional authority The monopoly is the wires and thats where the battles occur said Jeffrey K Skilling who was chief executive of Houstons Enron Corp the largest of the power merchants until he resigned last week The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation In with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid Congress opted for a competitive market The plan was to dismantle longstanding utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand Now these new merchants of power along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world have become strong advocates for a freeflowing national electricity market But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation they are running into resistance from traditional utilities exemplified by Atlantas Southern Co now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities At issue is how fast the federal government in the wake of the California electricity crisis should push for yet more changes Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC recently stocked with President Bushs promarket appointees ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities Those authorities in turn will build new transmission lines do away with bottlenecks set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all Next month the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South according to executives at Southern Co whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia Alabama Mississippi and north Florida Southern Co Chairman H Allen Franklin said in a recent interview will not go blindly into the system proposed by FERC Although unfettered access to Southerns miles of lines might help longdistance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron company officials say it could mean congestion power outages and higher prices for their million retail customers When California was restructured it was thought there would be massive savings Franklin said Well there havent been Building the Power Trade If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity a visit to Houston dispels them In the citys energy alley Enron Corp with annual sales of more than billion last year double those of Texaco is finishing a new floor office building adjacent to its story tower Enrons competitors Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy are a few blocks away Duke Energy North American merchant arm of Charlottebased Duke Power has settled in as well And Calpine Corp plans to take over floors of a new story building near Enron These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market which now handles about a quarter of US electricity output But it is still a work in progress fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market the Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas Many did Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast which had long endured high power costs To spur competition California and some northeastern states went further requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers Many states went further still ending their utilities long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity Enron formed in by the merger of two big gaspipeline companies was quick to seize the opportunities Its chairman Kenneth Lay a former official at the Federal Power Commission FERCs precursor during the Nixon administration had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the s As the electricity market began to develop in the early s Lay and Skilling a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets Enron signed its first longterm power contract in Skilling recalls Independent companies that wanted to install gasfired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under longterm contract then sell the electricity back to Enron We started creating forward and futures markets using a lot more financial engineering than was required in other commodity businesses Skilling said By the late s Enron was buying the output of generating plants days weeks months and even years before it was produced using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold During the past five years Enron has been one of the nations fastestgrowing companies Its net income rose percent in the second quarter of this year although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its high of mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity Investors pushed the price still lower after Skillings departure last week Southern Inhospitality Like other merchants Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition But the Southeast remained lessfriendly territory Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation Florida goes so far as to ban outofstate companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas The web of power lines tied to the utilities coal nuclear and gasfired generating plants reaches across states via kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles For Southern Co its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride In it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report Clustered around its borders are Entergy another huge holding company that serves Louisiana Arkansas and parts of Mississippi and Texas Florida Power Light Carolina Power Light Duke Power and the federal governments centralized power giant the Tennessee Valley Authority Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices Prices run percent or more below the national average thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the hightension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels FERC in a series of orders from to required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time The message a former official said was they couldnt use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed planttocustomer systems A November FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the regions utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region FERC investigators cited Southern Cos refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc connect to its transmission lines in Alabama Southern said the added load would cause an areawide stability problem for electric supply In that case FERC denied SkyGens request for relief Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that dayahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southerns territory have become possible But he said Enron has trouble getting longterm transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly Also he said Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southerns grid If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co to Jacksonville Electric thered be zero available Presto said Of the overall situation in the Southeast he said that the utilities give you to percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load retail customers So you have a huge highway thats supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isnt available to the wholesalers Southern Co Chairman Franklin dismissed as unfounded the complaints of the merchants and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Cos lines say they generally have been treated well Robert Johnston president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia MEAG which supplies power to towns took issue with the notion of a wire curtain The market is growing in Georgia he said MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers It also has its own generators producing power at four sites though Southern Co has an interest in all of them Theres not a grassroots interest driving the reforms Franklin said Its the wholesale players While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast though Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year Mirant Corp Southern Cos marketing subsidiary competed in California the Midwest and the North supplementing leaner profits from Southern Cos regulated units Southerns strategy has been clear Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home said Allen Mosher director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association Well Connected for Battle The next move is up to the federal government Next month Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission so that vested interests will not be able to manipulate the use of the transmission system to benefit their own plants Bingamans office said In the House key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa whose state is home to Southern Cos western neighbor Entergy and Rep Joe Barton RTex chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee who has had close ties to the huge coaldependent Texas utility TXU Last week Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L Hebert Jr a Mississippi proteacutegeacute of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott RMiss to handle regulatory and government affairs Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K Armey RTex as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie Associates Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTex the hometown Houston congressman though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay an enthusiast for electricity deregulation can bring to bear Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closeddoor meetings that DeLay sponsored but did not attend could not reach consensus on electricity As a result the energy bill passed by the House on Aug skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability Bushs election and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants Bushs first two appointees to FERC Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck Wood had worked with Enron during a sixyear effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas where Wood headed the states public utility commission Brownell a former Pennsylvania utility regulator won praise from Enron in when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market On July with a majority in tow Wood Brownell and William L Massey a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition tossed out proposals by Southern Co and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations or RTOs It was about time a bomb was dropped Wood said But FERCs action may only have been what power associations Mosher calls the beginning of a long movie Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of highvoltage power lines western propertyrights advocates and state utility regulators Politically wellconnected groups not now regulated by FERC including the TVA rural electric coops and municipal power systems are also wary of new federal powers There are big questions about FERCs role who will determine transmissionline charges should there be federal authority to site power lines should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability said Rep Richard Burr RNC vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners noted that her states three investorowned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines without our approval Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon Smith noted that percent of the states power comes from hydroelectric dams Thats public property she said In Alabama James Sullivan a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Cos affiliate said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding Im opposed to any changes to our electric system in Alabama until I know its going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us he said In the view of Southern Co Chairman Franklin it is still an open question whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires Nonetheless the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to put the genie back in the bottle according to a former FERC official The power merchants readily concur Everybodys paying too much because youve got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities Enrons Presto said Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section A Relentless Search for Growth Humbles a Mutual Fund Star By PATRICK McGEEHAN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company James D McCall was one of Wall Streets best stock pickers in the late s his hand so hot that Merrill Lynch eager to revive sales of its mutual funds paid a ransom to his previous employer to win his services Starting early last year Merrills brokers collected more than billion from their clients for Mr McCall to invest But in a breathtaking reversal of fortune Mr McCall has compiled one of the worst investment records of the new century with that money All but about million has been lost leaving shares that cost many Merrill customers more than each worth slightly more than As of Tuesday Mr McCalls main fund Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty held the rare distinction of ranking in the bottom percent among funds of its kind for the previous day week month quarter and year according to Morningstar Inc a company that analyzes mutual funds Though Mr McCall is free to invest anywhere in the stock market he has stuck to a growthseeking strategy that kept the fund invested primarily in technology stocks throughout that sectors long steep decline Down almost percent in the last year the funds performance has been significantly worse than that of the average technology fund let alone its peer group of more diversified funds It did however register aggressive gains in two market rallies Lately the Focus Twenty fund seemingly went from bad to cursed as some of Mr McCalls favorite stocks were laid even lower by a series of unfortunate surprises His bigger holdings include Enron whose shares fell percent after its chief executive suddenly resigned and Ciena which dropped percent in a day on disappointing earnings It has been a miserable week Mr McCall allowed in an interview on Tuesday Its not easy managing a portfolio like this in this type of an environment Mr McCalls rapid rise and fall demonstrates how fleeting stockpicking stardom can be said John C Bogle founder of the Vanguard Group mutual fund company Too often Mr Bogle said investors chase after the past returns of the fund manager of the moment only to find out they were pursuing a comet Investors in Vanguards own aggressive growth fund Vanguard Growth Equity have had their shares drop percent in value from their peak months ago Still Vanguard is known for its index funds the antithesis of Mr McCalls stockpicking discipline and Mr Bogle is indexings most outspoken champion In speeches around the country he has repeatedly and coyly avoiding any mention of Merrills name cited the giant brokerage firms creation of Focus Twenty and another fund in March as an example of racing to cash in on the latest market fad In roughly five weeks Merrills brokers gathered a total of more than billion for Focus Twenty and the Internet Strategies fund Almost immediately those funds collapsed along with the Internet and technology stocks they owned Internet Strategies which Mr McCall does not manage never recovered and has now lost more than percent of its value Merrill plans to merge it with another of its stock funds But Mr McCall said his fund did not face a similar fate Indeed he said Robert Doll the chief investment officer for Merrills funds recently told the firms brokers that Merrill was committed to Focus Twenty and its aggressive concentrated style Mr Doll was not available for comment but Merrill confirmed Mr McCalls account We are committed to having a full range of investment styles aggressive growth being one of them said a spokesman Erik Hendrickson Funds seeking to rack up marketbeating returns by making big bets on as few as stocks proliferated in the late s in part because of Mr McCalls success managing the PBHG Large Cap fund for Pilgrim Baxter a fund company in Wayne Pa In the two and a half years Mr McCall ran it the PBHG fund ranked first among its peer group funds that buy stocks of large companies whose earnings are expected to grow quickly with average annual returns of more than percent It was those knockout numbers that brought Merrill calling in its search for proven growthfund managers to broaden the firms valueoriented lineup of funds After Mr McCall accepted Merrills job offer Pilgrim Baxter sued to stop him from breaking his employment contract Mr McCall countersued and Merrill later agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the litigation In court papers Pilgrim Baxter disclosed that Mr McCall had earned as much as million annually there Mr McCall and Merrill officials have repeatedly declined to reveal how much the firm paid Pilgrim Baxter or any details of Mr McCalls compensation at Merrill Often however investment returns affect the pay of fund managers Like Focus Twenty most of the concentrated funds sank last year with the collapse of technology stocks The managers of some of those funds including Marsico Focus have shifted money out of volatile technology and telecommunications stocks and into more mature companies like Citigroup and Omnicom which owns ad agencies Mr McCall sniffed at some of those choices saying that the fund managers were not staying true to their mission of aggressive growth investing Im not going to own an Omnicom he said or a Sony or a Viacom or General Dynamics because theyre growing in the single digits Thomas Marsico the manager of Marsico Focus and one of the original concentratedfund managers did not return a call seeking comment Mr McCall said he would continue to try to identify the companies that have the best chance of increasing their profits at extraordinary rates regardless of what value other investors are assigning to those prospects at any given time Valuation is not one of the factors that enters into our methodology Mr McCall said About percent of Focus Twentys assets are in technology stocks according to Morningstar But the funds biggest holding now is Idec Pharmaceuticals a drug maker Kunal Kapoor a Morningstar analyst who tracks Merrills funds calls Mr McCall a momentum investor who seeks growth at any price Mr McCall may be the best investor of that stripe Mr Kapoor said but the strategy is so risky that he questions whether it was ever appropriate for so many of Merrill customers I was really surprised by the amount of funds they were able to raise for a fund like that in such a short time Mr Kapoor said The question is Do you really need a fund like this Reading a prepared statement Mr Hendrickson said Merrill Lynch considered concentrated funds to be an appropriate option for some investors because they maximize the impact of professional stockpicking over the long term and additionally may serve as an alternative to individual stock holdings He pointed out that Merrill managed another concentrated fund Merrill Lynch Focus Value that had performed well this year gaining more than percent As for Mr McCalls returns Mr Kapoor said he could not fault Focus Twenty because it had performed as would be expected for a fund of its composition It rang up some of the biggest gains of any fund in two brief periods when the market picked up the third quarter of and April of this year and some of the biggest losses when the market was down Rather he said he was more disappointed with the other fund Mr McCall manages the Merrill Lynch Premier Growth fund which is supposed to be less volatile because it holds about stocks That fund is down more than percent this year and has shrunk to less than million in assets Mr McCall said that he had warned Merrills brokers all along just how volatile his returns could be and that Focus Twenty was no place for investors to put money they might need any time soon But he said he thinks that now more than ever is the time to take a chance on the fund with its shares selling for about I dont think a share is a lot to risk the indomitable fund manager said We could go down from here certainly but over the long term there is more potential on the upside than on the downside Photo Before James D McCall came to Merrill Lynch he was at Pilgrim Baxter where he successfully managed the PBHG Large Cap fund Ethan Hillpg C Chart Losing Big Since March clients of Merrill Lynch have poured more than billion into the main fund managed by James D McCall As

and sometimes impossible Utilities operate their own contained systems and advise traders when and if they have ATC available transmission capacity Electricity trading is a commodity business not

Prayas has not yet received the sheaf of documents from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB concerning the Dabhol power project DPC which it had asked for The MERC had passed an order on July asking the MSEB to furnish the financial documents relating to some contracts signed by Enron for the project The MSEB is learnt to be now examining the legality of making these documents public after a stern letter from the Dabhol Power Company pointing out that the board might be liable for damages and legal action if the contractors take offence to making the documents public Enron wrote to the MSEB a few days after the order contending that most of these documents had confidentiality clauses which would make it actionable Asked about this sources at DPC said that suppliers would be upset if their terms and conditions were made public since Enrons is only one of the plants sourcing business from them For instance Enrons LNG fuel supply contract with an Oman company has a confidentiality clause and would fear exposing its contract terms to the public in view of the fact that over per cent of its supply is concentrated in Japan Taiwan and Korea It would be damaging for its business if

Indias reform drive Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited ANALYSISPoor governance hobbles Indias reform drive By Alan Wheatley Asian Economics Correspondent NEW DELHI Aug Reuters After six months of political stalemate the rave reviews for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinhas reforming budget have given way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps India embraces change only in a crisis In which case a new wave of reforms might not be far away For unless growth picks up substantially from last years percent pace policy experts said India would face a further deterioration in its public finances and rising unemployment that could put the worlds largest democracy under serious strain We cant go on without further reforms for very long because we wont be able to grow even by five percent said Shashanka Bhide chief economist of the National Council of Applied Economic Research So the crisis is already there If were not going to get six percentplus growth rates then its a political problem There is a broad consensus on paper on the need for a second wave of reforms to build on groundbreaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a balanceofpayments crisis in Because its economy is fairly closed India has weathered the current global downturn much better than most of its Asian neighbours who would be delighted with five percent growth Still output has slowed for two years in a row as postreform momentum has petered out And crucially five percent growth falls far short of the percent average needed over the next decade to achieve Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayees goal of doubling per capita income currently around a year Eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed which means there will be greater social unrest said P Chidambaram a former finance minister A five percent growth rate while statistically acceptable is simply politically unacceptable and socially unacceptable COMPETITIVE POLITICS It was to raise the economys speed limit that Sinha unveiled in his February budget a raft of farreaching structural reforms making it easier to fire workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for small and mediumsized firms The reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in India but they soon became mired in what the Planning Commission aptly calls the compulsion of competitive politics On a charitable view the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kaleidoscope that is Indias multiparty democracy This is not a country this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in the political domain the social domain and the economic domain said Amit Mitra secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry Less charitably the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfeebled Vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy party coalition and force ministers to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests opposed to change Arjun Sengupta a professor at the Centre for Policy Research said the absence of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its own furrow resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly needed investment This is the main problem we have today we do not have a coherent unified policy framework Sengupta said He said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult because Indias most populous and backward states were falling farther and farther behind the betteroff ones If the Centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the states we are facing major problems which can become explosive Sengupta a former ambassador and IMF official said Peering through the gloom optimists point to the precedent of legislation passed without the pressure of a crisis in to open up Indias insurance market to foreign firms They hope two equally controversial reform bills to liberalise the crisisridden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms will also eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week ending months of wrangling Anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasnt looked at figures on poverty very closely said Planning Commission member NK Singh He said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to percent from percent REFORM PRIORITIES The list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy Because of its pivotal role in the economy the power sector is many experts number one priority The wellcatalogued troubles that foreign firms such as Enron Corp have encountered dealing with Indias allbutbankrupt state power boards have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors Domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twice as much as they would in China for electricity Nevertheless attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political rocks how to end overmanning at the power boards estimated at percent and how to charge users mainly farmers market rates for stolen or heavily subsidised power DK Srivastava a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be assured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek reelection two or three years later Any government under any minister will say to you How can I survive unless I can show my voters jobs Srivastava said This is one of the basic constraints on power sector reform TK Bhaumik a senior adviser at the Confederation of Indian Industry agreed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the case for change to Indias mass poor We did not articulate the economic reform process to the people Bhaumik said On privatisation for instance policymakers did not spell out the consequences for jobs I dont think we really understood the issues properly We simply followed the Washington consensus and that didnt go down well with the people he said As Divestment Minister Arun Shourie knows only too well The privatisation programme he oversees a litmus test of Indias reform will is stalled because of what Shourie calls fractured politics and noise generated by corporate interests Shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt Indias politicians into putting the countrys interests first Were on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and I feel the real circumstances in which India is placed will force the political class to do the right thing he said Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Bias Suit Against Microsoft Aims at Flat Workplace Hierarchies By Yochi J Dreazen and Jess Bravin Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc The lawyers pursuing a racial discrimination lawsuit against Microsoft Corp are gearing up to put merit pay and other cherished tenets of the New Economy workplace on trial before both a jury and the court of public opinion The suit which was filed yesterday in federal court in Washington DC seeks classaction status on behalf of hundreds of current and former black employees of the Redmond Wash software giant The plaintiffs a group of seven current and former Microsoft employees accuse the company of racial discrimination with regard to promotions and compensation and also allege that Microsoft wrongfully terminated some of its black employees The suit asks for at least billion of compensatory and punitive damages They have a plantationtype mentality when it comes to the treatment of AfricanAmerican employees at the company said Willie Gary the highprofile plaintiffs attorney bringing the suit who also is involved in a similar case against CocaCola Co It borders on corporate slavery Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he couldnt comment on the specifics of the suit but said We have a fairly strong track record of not tolerating discrimination in any of our employment practices The page complaint takes issue with otherwise ordinary interactions among Microsoft employees in contrast with some recent discrimination suits against other big corporations that featured accusations of abusive language toward black employees and of racist office displays including nooses and swastikas The suit alleges that some of the most widely replicated aspects of a New Economy workplace flat corporate hierarchies where workers can bypass managers and merit pay that isnt tied to an employees seniority allowed Microsoft to systematically discriminate against its AfricanAmerican employees The suit amends an existing action filed on behalf of Rahn Jackson an eightyear veteran of Microsofts Washington DC office who had led a team of employees selling software to the US military Mr Jackson claims that despite receiving solid scores on performance reviews he repeatedly was passed over for promotions that went to white employees Mr Jackson has since left Microsoft and now handles corporate sales for one of the companys biggest competitors Sun Microsystems Inc of Palo Alto Calif The case could foreshadow a wave of similar claims against other hightechnology companies especially if the sector sheds thousands of workers amid the slowing economy John C Fox who heads the employmentlaw practice at Palo Altos Fenwick West said his law firm has spent weeks readying layoff plans for Silicon Valley companies which are preparing for a major round of cuts slated for Monday He declined to name the companies But whenever there are layoffs lawsuits inevitably follow Mr Fox said There will be a lot of discrimination claims You can bet your bottom dollar on that he said He predicted though that because there are relatively few minorities working in Silicon Valley most discrimination claims will come from white male workers more than years old who are protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act The Jackson suit against Microsoft focuses on the fact that at many companies including Microsoft managers are asked to grade their employees with the scores used in awarding promotions stock options and pay raises Many younger employees cherish such systems which allow skilled but relatively inexperienced workers to get paid more and rise faster than they would have under a traditional seniority system The subjective nature of such evaluations however could permit managers to discriminate against employees because of their race or age or sex as the plaintiffs in the Microsoft case allege Indeed Mr Jackson said in an interview that he and other black employees were being paid less than a third as much as comparably situated white employees and received fewer stock options Microsoft denies black employees were routinely paid less than their white counterparts though it refused to specifically address the suit saying personnel matters are confidential The suit also highlights the potential for controversy that exists when companies enact flat hierarchies designed to allow junior employees to freely interact with senior managers as a way to increase productivity and tear down barriers between workers Mr Jacksons suit for instance accuses Microsoft of fostering a hostile work environment by allowing a junior white employee to publicly challenge and defy him and to bypass him in the offices formal chain of command Microsofts Mr Ballmer however insisted his company has worked very hard to promote minority and women employees despite having to contend with a general shortage of engineering talent in the software industry Microsoft has invested more than million in initiatives to stimulate interest in science and technology among women and minorities he noted Rebecca Buckman contributed to this article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BusinessFinancial Desk Section C TECHNOLOGY New Bias Lawsuit Is Filed Against Microsoft By The New York Times The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Seven former and current employees of the Microsoft Corporation filed a lawsuit today contending that the company had engaged in racial discrimination in its employment practices and seeking certification as a class action on behalf of all former and current black Microsoft employees The suit filed in federal district court here builds on a discrimination suit brought in June by Rahn D Jackson a former account executive for Microsoft Mr Jacksons complaint was refiled today to include the six other plaiontiffs Mr Jackson said today at a news conference here that he had raised his concerns with Microsoft before filing his suit but that he received little response We really didnt want to have to be here today he said The plaintiffs are four former employees from Microsofts office in the District of Columbia and two former and one current employee at its headquarters in Redmond Wash The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson who presided over the governments antitrust case against Microsoft and ordered the company to be split into two parts Microsoft which is appealing has argued that Judge Jackson committed substantive errors in the antitrust case Deborah Willingham vice president for human resources at Microsoft said the company was percent committed to diversity She declined to comment on the specific complaint because she had not reviewed it Willie E Gary a lawyer for the plaintiffs said at the news conference that Microsoft discriminated against black employees in evaluations compensation promotions and termination There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft he said Mr Gary who won a bias lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company last year also represents four plaintiffs in a pending discrimination suit against the CocaCola Company Mr Gary presented employment figures that he said supported the complaint In percent of the companys employees were black Mr Gary said and of the companys managers just percent were black Mr Gary said that he gathered the figures by speaking to Microsoft employees and from internal company documents Ms Willingham said that Microsoft has a zerotolerance policy toward discrimination in the workplace She added that We take any allegations of discrimination very seriously and immediately investigate any concern that is raised A company spokeswoman said that percent of Microsofts domestic work force of was black and that in the last three years there had been an percent increase in the number of black employees The percentage of all minority employees at the company has risen from percent in to about percent of the domestic work force today she said This is not the only lawsuit contending racial bias at Microsoft In October Monique Donaldson a former program manager for Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the company claiming racial and gender bias that lawsuit is pending in federal district court in Seattle And Peter Browne who had been Microsofts highestranking black executive before leaving the company in September filed a discrimination lawsuit shortly after his departure Photo Rahn

Subject This is the note I want you to distribute You may have gotten by mistake a shorter version which you can discard Forwarded by Terence H ThornENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Terence H Thorn AM To Maureen ES cc Subject Maureen would you distribute this note Friday morning to everyone who participates in the Friday call ThanksT Again I find myself in a time zone Korea that will prevent me from participate in the weekly call Although I realize that this will do nothing to dispel the rumor that Thorn has become virtual only an email address that floats in space its a good time of year to update you on key activities that I am handling or involved in personally that will carry over to next year This certainly isnt inclusive for the global affairs group Hopefully each week Mike or Gia has ben giving you a good run down of the broad range of activities from throughout the world in which the group participates At the top of the list is Japan where I spent Thanksgiving week with Joe and Nicholas Although we continue to make the rounds to both gauge reactions to and promote our comments the most important time was spent internally putting together a market entry plan and objectives for the next few months The MITI schedule is November file comments December the Joint Working Group meets to submit guidelines to MITIguidelines are official December submitted comments are made public December can we get the Japan Fair Trade Commission the monopoly laws changed to cover utilities Probably not until the Spring January The electric utilities publish their tariffs March the market opens under the published tariff schedule Feed back indicates that our comments to MITI were well received and they may take the extraordinary step of responding in writing Still we dont expect many if any changes My read is simple and reflects the advice we received from one Japanese official dont do seminars do business Until we can actually test the system with a transaction were spinning our wheels Wrobels people hope to lock up some generation from a steel company by the end of the year and then its up to Hirl Nick and I to help them do a back to back PPA and navigate the new regulations Thats when all of the obstacles the utilities throw up come out of the wood work and we see if the rates make a sale possible Were in for a long incremental battle I met with the MITI person in New York in Seattle and Edith covered bases with USTR In January Hirl and I will go to London to work through the European experience and see how the Japanese structure mimics or allows the types of experiences weve seen in Europe Prior to Tokyo I was asked to be at APECs energy working group meeting in Wellington The APEC Energy Ministers established an energy working group that develops programs and projects for their approval The Ministers also wanted to have strong business involvement so the Energy Business Network was created this past year with two business men representing each economy I along with Ken Thompson from ARCO was appointed by DOE for two years to represent the US Energy industry We have produced such things as the IPP best practices manual and most importantly the Natural Gas Initiative which provided a complete compendium of the things Asia economies would have to do attract foreign investment to develop much needed gas infrastructure This was followed by approval of a consultative process where economies invite teams in from the business communities to address gas or electric issues We just finished a very successful visit to Thailand where I used Nancy Gardiner as a key speaker on pipeline deregulation basically telling PTT there is life after death privatizationliberalization She did great and has the temperate Knowledge and style to get our meessage across Unfortunately to some economies such strong business involvement is an anathema to their protected worlds and do everything to eliminate or reduce the EBN influence Barry Leay the Chair of the EBN asked me to be at his side to defend against attacks by the Japanese Mexicans and Chinese We argued and won a strong endorsement of the EBN and its work lost a little on the consultative process DOE was no help with a little more EWG controlinterference and kept energy services alive at least through Spring Ken and I will met with US energy companies in Houston on December to go over developments and plan for The US group is split with the majors opposing a strong deregulation agenda and an energy services initiative which they interpret as open access for some reason This type of involvement keeps us face to face with the ministers and energy ministers of Asian economies and allows us to push through an official government organization a liberalization agenda Joe Hillings will provide you a complete update on the WTO Seattle Ministerial this week Any typos in this note can be blamed on the residual effects of tear gas It seemed odd to me to be on this side of a police line Everyone is aware of the outstanding job Joe Hllings has done in forming the Energy Services Coalition in less than a year Our major goal is Seattle was to get energy services on the negotiating agenda It looks like all services will be included but not broken out by categories You just assume energy is included The only thing that worries me is that a three year period has been designated to study the issue with no milestones or deadlines during the period That was as of Wednesday Again Joe will know how it ended up The side meetings were excellent with Eisenstat the gaza project the Bolivia conservation planhes on the OPIC board and Suttons ABAC nomination Secretary Daly South America and Mack McLarty Mark Following on a conversation and suggestion with Ken Lay Mack did talk to Clinton about Blairs swing to the left and the energy tax policy and both of us in separate meetings talked to Al From who is a close friend of one of Blairs key advisors Al will talk to him about his departure from the third way Ken Lay had a keynote address Thursday and lots of interviews so Im sure he knocked them dead Kelly handled all the interviews and Ill look forward to hearing from her how it went Whats alarming about Seattle is the backlash against the WTO which has become a symbol for globalization Trade is no longer an economic issue its a social issue Eisenstat said it best We have five tasks as a governmment and industry an education effort about trade and it benefits we cant be defensive demystify the WTO it is a powerful instrument to make countres abide by the trade rules clarify the US trade agenda give the less developed nations a sense of equity and participation open up the WTO system to be more inclusive to these groups who feel shut out Open markets are critical to Enrons international success Well need to decide next year what role we want to play in this debate and right out of the block weve got Chinas WTO agrement with the US After my DLC presentation I talked to reps from the unions and from the environmental groups about opening a dialogue and what would be a good forum to discuss the WTO and related trade issues No one has any answers yet I continue to work with Shell and the NGOs to set up the US Trust fund for the million dollar Bolivian conservation plan The Associon de Hecht has cleared its legal review Its not going to happen until January We have also had an open letter to the president of Bolivia criticizing us for violating our agreements with the indigenous peoples Dennis Vegas is working on this as is Abe Moreno Meet with them find out if were really at fault and fix it I have found the person I want to hire for a environmental liaison for the southern cone based in Bolivia She will also be our main rep working on the conservation plan and with the indigenous communities In the end Rachel can be a trouble shooter for the southern cone I will meet with Jim Broad way in December our consultant on setting of the Environmental Management System for the Blivian project for a debrief and lessons learned Mike Dahlke has an optimistic report on our Korean tax issue and it looks like well get the percentage reductions we want for the threshold for holding company participation If the holds its a great vistory that took a year to accomplish I am in Korea now working on next years final budget and strategy Im on the SKEnron board and a new bid for some of KEPCOs genration They have just told us they want everyone to bid again Sounds lke Mexico and Vietnam We had a long discussion over our formal Korean dinner tonight on the best way to collect and prepare mosquito eyes It looks like weve the Bangdalesh Power Development Board blink and agree that electricity form our proposed plant could be exported to India as long as LPGs from the gas go to Nepal and Bhutan Jim Steffes dream of going to Bangdalesh may come true We got caught in a political p contest between the two major political factions in Columbia over our legislation to allow exports of Columbiaa Gas through an Enron pipeline to central America We also had quite an internal debate on open access pipelines Things are progressing and Amr is doing a great job We have reached a critical junction in Thailand and if we dont start generating income well have to shut down or at least cut back Merrill Grimes and Jane and myself will be participating in an all hands strategy session with the Thailand team in December to flesh out priorities and real opportunities and hopefullt make some tough calls Sue has everyones comments in on the new enviromental due diligence hand book and module We can now begin working on the costs tables where we can provide real cost data on different clean up problems With all the work we have done over the years weve never kept organized records of actual costs which could provide much better estimates when we bid on a project in the future Palmisano Whalley and I have agreed on a commercial plan for the carbon trading business for On the commercialside well start pusuing projects that generate credits for sale as well as continue discussions with other companies about participating in an Enron carbon fund We conducting an inventory internally our carbon position are we long or short and which projects will generate credits for sale An internal trading system is inevitable We are developing contract language for all deals so that any project any Enron company is involved in can capture credits of they are developed The GHG data base will be carried over to an entire inventory of Enron emissions When in New Zealand I visited two projects from which we could buy and market credits one of which looks like the best sequestraton project i have ever seen Weve created an internal working group to assist the GHP on Houstons ozone problem Our next get together will be around the th I hooked up with Andrew Makk on the Gaza project and we agreed on a work plan for the rest of December with the Israelis and others to move the project along Key now will be a future gas supply and I will be working with El Paso who made the short list on the piplene from Egypt When I travelled with Daly last month I met all of teh cabinet members in Israeli Egypt and Jordan and had private side meetings withteh energy ministers and infrastructure ministers There is a real cahnce Egyptian or Jordian gas will move to Israel and Gaza hoepfully to our projects Mosquitos eyes have a slightly nutty flavor and when cooked properly are crunchy

and is in todays Houston Chronicle We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy SF team Please distribute to all legislators trade and industry organizations etc Linda Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington Maureen Please distribute to the internal GA team Thanks kd Editorial Desk Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in

Sandra nron Paul CT Linda NRON Peggy ES Maureen nron cc Steven J nron Richard nron James D nron Subject California Power Failure Please see attached editorial which ran in yesterdays New York Times and is in todays Houston Chronicle We are distributing to all key media who have been covering California energy SF team Please distribute to all legislators trade and industry organizations etc Linda Please forward to Quinn Gillespie to distribute in Washington Maureen Please distribute to the internal GA team Thanks kd Editorial Desk Section A Essay California Power Failure By WILLIAM SAFIRE The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES In the past decade California has become the most Democratic state in the nation It has a Democratic governor two liberal Democratic senators and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast Then why Californians now ask themselves is their state the most troubled in the nation Bad enough that Hollywoods writers are preparing to strike worse that speculators in Silicon Valley startups are watching their stack of chips dwindle worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the states hair stand on end The price of electricity is soaring yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy Whos to blame The chosen villain deregulation As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work cry liberal voices those heartless capitalists drove up prices Bring back the cool calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control But in fact the first villain is botched deregulation not as bad as in Russia but tis enough twill do Californias politicians deregulated halfway which is the worst way wholesale prices were freed from controls but retail prices were not Consumers remained seemingly protected but the utility companies which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever were enabled to buy on the spot market Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade longterm contracts which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand The good times of the s sharply increased demand for electric power But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power Result upward pressure on prices calls for rationing utilities going broke government intervention that frightens off private investment and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for percent of the nations product The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is nimby the real villain in the current supply crisis that says not in my backyard to power plants In San Jose epicenter of the computer industrys drain on electric power New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in years Contrary to popular belief electricity does not come from the socket in the wall The steady flow of lowcost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop airconditioners wheeze and computers beep Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines nothing comes out of the wall Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power now a safe and clean source of electricity or the use of cleanedup coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable but cleanair extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricitys household convenience The answer is not reregulation nor more halfwayism nor federal bailout When Gov Gray Davis of California raced to Washington DC to ask for wholesale price controls he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate Clintonappointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives with photo op to follow Daviss panicked proposal to build stateowned plants in Nevada On the moon and his threat to seize the assets of price gougers may please some new breed of dotcommunists But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist After shortterm action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present politicalindustrial blindness our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls They never work in
