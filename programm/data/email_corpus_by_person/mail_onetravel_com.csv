your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip How to get the most miles out of your flying Identify your likes and dislikes and pick a carrieralliance to meet those needs Once you have a carrier they will do their best to keep you through various promotions and coupons Stick with that carrieralliance even though you might find that another airline beats them by This can become a penny wise pound foolish situation if you are trying to achieve elite status which brings with it additional free miles Join any discount programs for which you qualify or programs like NWAcom Club for further discounts Consider alternative airports served by your alliance whenever you can This can save you hundreds of dollars for a drive of just an hour or so Since you are working with an alliance check the other airline partners That is if you see Continental flights on Onetravelcom they may actually be flights operated by Northwest You buy a ticket on Continental from Onetravelcom and end up flying on your primary carrier Northwest This practice is called code sharing Consider open jaw and circle routes instead of two oneway or two roundtrip tickets Use rail travel on the open portions of these types of tickets if you can and remember that you can earn miles on a few rail routes depending on your carrier If you do fly four to six roundtrips per year on your carrieralliance it is quite possible to achieve elite status which brings with it additional miles and that wonder of wonders the first class upgrade But most of all in order to get the most benefit from leisure travel and the best price as well be flexible when you travel Next week tips for picking your hotel and rental car partners wisely Happy Contrails Bob Mr Maximiler Jones QUESTIONS

SMART TRAVELERS CORNER This week columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON THREE Flexibility Timewhat a concept Truly the one thing we have no control over It can be on your side or your timing couldnt be worse Flexibility is very important in ensuring you obtain the best value possible in your travels While many view planning and flexibility as mutually exclusive terms planning is very important in maximizing savings while the flexibility aspect ensures readiness to take advantage of an offer when it appears More on planning next week Not only is flexibility important for finding value it is also important for your travel mental health Delays are quite common for fights rail cruises and in the lines formed for security checks and rental cars As leisure travelers we have the ability to build in time for the unexpected This inherent flexibility goes a long way in allowing a modicum of sanity Flexibility even lends itself to destinations Lets say you are traveling from New York to Disneyland in California You get to the airport and find out that your flight has been canceled and the remaining flights into Los Angeles International are full for the rest of the day Now understand that many times counter agents are harried during such times and may additionally be geographically challenged The agent may not suggest going into Santa Ana and even you might not think of it but clearly SNA is an excellent alternative airport to LAX when traveling to the area Truth is there are three others to pick from as well So be flexible in destination airports A twohour drive can save you a days wait for a flight Flexibility can mean perks like free tickets and travel vouchers Unless I am traveling in conjunction with an airhotel package I make it a point to take advantage of over filled flights To do this I will book myself on an earlier flight in the day or even travel the evening before I check in advance to see how full the flight is and whether or not it makes sense to volunteer for a later flight Over the years this flexibility has earned my family of four well over in vouchers It is important to remember that we are not typical leisure travelers since we fly between and miles per year The thing is that volunteering can be profitable Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers

wwwspecialsSalescfmhotel SMART TRAVELERS CORNER This week columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON FOUR Planning Sometime between Christmas and New Years I determine where and approximately when I want to travel during the coming year I have two recurring annual trips that are pretty much in stone but the remaining travels are based on what I think will be good values and opportunities in the coming year The destinations selected are generic That is I will look at locations with similar attributes for a general time frame and not lock myself into a specific place As an example Costa del Sol in southern Spain is lovely in late winter and even though Morocco is located in Africa it has a similar climate and may even undercut European prices So while I plan a geographical area I remain flexible in the exact location Regional destination selected it is time to begin watching for specials These specials happen very quickly and require some effort to ensure availability The initial activity is to simply inform your travel agent if you use one of your general requirements and let them do the searching for you Tell them your travel window general location and your budget limit It is also important to advise them if your total budget includes meals An allinclusive package at Club Med may be just as good a deal or better than an on your own package where you choose the chow If you are planning trips on your own via the Internet identify sites like th Hour Vacations to begin your search Be sure to check back often as this site specializes in last minute deals that come and go quickly Check the major carriers themselves as they offer vacation packages at extremely good prices Prices overall will remain low for some time as providers work hard to get folks back into the travel mode Airlines cruise lines hotels and other industry components are working hard to fill seats berths and beds Even now most travel sales extend well into the spring of which is a definite asset in planning Keep your eyes open and you too can have a very affordable vacation this year See you on a flight soon Bob ADDITIONAL STEALS AND DEALS

press release I had been expecting Northwest Airlines today announced that it is eliminating blackout dates for WorldPerks award travel Wow thats not what it is supposed to say it is supposed to say Take advantage of your last chance to book Northwest Continental Airlines OffPeak Rewards Beginning June this reward will no longer be available After all this is what Continental had said the week before and what I was expecting from Northwest was to be the same announcement simply because as partners Continental and Northwests programs are mirror images of each other What I found disturbing is what each carrier didnt say in their release The missing words were left to be said by the other partner That is since the programs mirror each other shouldnt the releases have been the same and not parsed in such a manner as to require reading of both releases to get a truer picture For the complete story and what you can do visit advisorARAirlineNewsArticlecfmArticleID See you on a flight soon

best travel deal TRAVEL Lesson Five Hidden airfare savings Many times travelers will access a site and ask for a specific carrier instead of just allowing the central reservation system to do what it does best find the best price for your flight What many travelers dont realize is that the flights returned to your desktop may be code share flights These flights are ticketed on one carrier but flown on another As a general rule these flights are between partner or alliance members but occasionally you will find a code share between pure competitors such as Northwest and American Eagle in the Northeast The code share agreements may be left over from previous contracts between carriers but in any case it is possible to save some money by looking at the fine print Case in point I am writing this on a Northwest en route Seattle from Grand Rapids MI When I initially shopped for tickets the best I could do specifying Northwest flights was about on a day advance purchase While this was a good price it was not great Resetting the parameters to any carrier I found Continental had a flight for What would be strange to the untrained eye is that the time of departure and arrival were exactly the same as Northwest flight Hmmmm flight flight Thats right same airplane different flight numbers By spending less I was able to fly on a Northwest flight using a Continental ticket and flight number Granted I lost some frequent flyer bonus miles in doing so but in this case the money saved on the ticket was substantially more than the lost bonus miles Okay so why couldnt I find the fare on Northwest There are lots of imponderables in air travel First why does a roundtrip ticket cost less than a one way I get this question a lot and frankly have never found a satisfactory answer for reply It is right up there with riddle of the Sphinx and why does a one liter bottle of Coke cost more than a two liter bottle But back to code sharing What has probably occurred in this case is simply that Northwest sold out their allotment of seats in this particular fare basis while Continental did not Therefore armed with knowledge of how code shares worked I was able to save Something I so enjoy doing So when you are looking for flights compare flight numbers and times There is a good chance you can save a few dollars by picking the code share over the real carrier itself See you on

features upto theminute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip Blackout dates a thing of the past A few weeks back Northwest eliminated black out dates for award travel Of course they raised the number of miles required for award travel because they believed travelers found it difficult to understand the nuances of peak and off peak awards Puleeeeeez Anyhow not long after the NWA announcement their partners came on board followed by United American Delta and others So are you going to be able to save some cash and book normally expensive holiday trips using miles I doubt it Heres why All frequent flyer seats are released on a not to interfere with revenue basis Airlines know historically what seats they will sell and which they will not The ones they do not sell are released to awards Since the airlines sell virtually every seat on December rd and th along with seats on the th through the th dont expect to find any seats availableat least not now The same holds true for the period around the th of July Put simply award seats are allotted to days and flights the airlines believe they can not fill with revenue passengers So while there are no black out dates per se they really do exist since seats will not be available on peak travel dates But wait there is hope Yield Management the practice of pricing and repricing seats every few seconds to get maximum revenue is also working for the frequent flyer with miles to spend Recently it has been possible to redeem miles at the last minute as airlines release seats that remain unsold While this method is not for the faint of heart you can get seats to good destinations Flexibility in travel dates is important and creativity in routing may also be necessary as getting from A to B may require a visit of C and D along the way Remember too that your best chances are with carriers with multiple partners like Alaska Airlines Using an Alaska award you can get from Houston to Seattle on Continental American or Northwest A simple form on their site sslpartnerPartnerFormasp will get you started and they will check all their partners for you At Northwest you can book awards online and their system checks partners automatically Visit cgibinatrredircgi for more information Patience can pay See you on a flight soon Bob QUESTIONS COMMENTS Wed

columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON EIGHT Hotels whats your choice Truly the hardest part of any journey is where do we stay With the exception of package deals that include air and hotel or car and hotel you are pretty much on your own You can choose from BB type accommodations membership clubs mostly in Europe hostels pensions and small country inns to hotels and resorts Even within a category accommodations can vary from basic to luxurious As a leisure traveler who travels a couple of times a year for a total of two to three weeks does it make sense to stick with one brand Well maybe but for those who travel less taking advantage of offers and selecting airline miles over hotel rewards may make more sense For this lesson lets look at some basic saving strategies Just as with flights hotel rooms are priced depending on time Season day of the week and so forth determine what hotels charge A subtle point is that many hotels also charge by their type and location That is a business hotel located in an industrial area may charge top dollar during the week as business travelers work within a mile or so of the hotel On the weekend that rate can plummet as the hotelier works to fill the rooms Obversely the tourist hotel located within walking distance of a Bunch O Flags theme park and pizza haven or on the strip in Las Vegas will charge their highest rates on the weekend doubling or even trebling the Sunday through Thursday night rate Taking advantage of these pricing anomalies can save you substantially if you book your rooms properly A feature found on indexcfmactionhomepage allows you to look at a specific time frame for several properties at once and view the per night room rate A quick look at Las Vegas will show rates for a sevennight stay at Circus Circus from Sunday through Thursday to for that same room Friday and Saturday night Is it possible to get that rate down Sure just remember that many tourist destinations including Las Vegas have been experiencing lower occupancy So armed with the reservation number from your online booking call the property and ask for the reservation manager Simply tell them that you have booked a week at their hotel and would be a happier guest if the rate didnt go up on the weekend Chances are that you will receive some sort of adjustment just by asking Your

provides tips on getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON SEVEN Travel Clubs a good idea There are several travel clubs now purporting to offer exceptional savings to their members The first type offers very low cost or even free airfare if you simply book your hotel with them Many have a one week minimum stay requirement and charge rates which far exceed what the smart traveler can find using free online services or a mainline agency for both the cost of air and hotel A second membership program says they will save you off published hotel rates They will but that is of the highest rate Its easy to find discounts aplenty just using credit cards AAA AARP or other memberships The third type requires you join just to see the deals However the restrictions once viewed may be too many to be of any advantage Before I pay I want the full story so I want to get full disclosure Ask to visit Members Only areas If they will not provide full disclosure or a free tour then remember your Latin Caveat Emptor Here is a club deal example A site is touting New York to European destinations for Only Wow What a deal I emailed the company to get details and total price This site charges a membership fee but before I pay I want to make sure that what I see is what I pay Problem is that so far I have not received a reply and doubt seriously if I will Why Well you dont get the total price until you join and unless I am wrong taxes customs and immigration fees security costs and segment taxes are not included in the Nowhere in the hype on the main page or the description does it mention a thing about taxes or fees other than the fuel and charges that may be additional So what are the taxes and fees to Europe from New York About The total cost for this deal membership fee A good deal Sure if you didnt look at other sites where you will find prices right around Now if you travel to Europe more than twice a year joining might pay off But overall you will probably do better without a membership I believe it is better to rely on newsletters such as this and SideStepcoms to really find the deals See you on a flight soon Bob ADDITIONAL STEALS AND DEALS FROM Onetravelcom nights in St

getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON Nine Rental CarsA thousand prices a single car Ah the rental car Easiest part of the trip For many this spoils an entire vacation At first glance one would think Rental Cars would be the simplest aspect of travel Talk about prices varying The airlines have nothing on the car folks As far as I am concerned the only positive aspect or car rental is that a reservation is not a commitment One or two companies tried to charge for reservations that were not kept but amid outcry they stole quietly into the night Advance purchase pretends to exist but some discount coupons can actually add or more to the cost of a car At times The best deal can happen at the counter without or in spite of a reservation If you are uninformed the counter agent can convince you that your credit card wont cover your loss many cards do but check with the institution to be sure and will proceed to sell you insurance you dont need Next the agent tells you the compact you reserved is not available and the agent manages to upgrade you to what remains a full size car The per day compact car you reserved is now a full size car Add the additional in insurance and the fueling option for even though you told the agent you needed the car for one day and were going downtown to a meeting and then back the next day and we have a total cost for the special of plus tax and a Concession Recovery Fee Now we have a car that should have cost you to tot al with taxes fees and the fuel you put in to top it off You should have been upgraded at no charge due to nonavailability of the compact but you paid a whopping or more Wow what happened Do your homework First join one or two rental car companies frequent renter programs Dont pay the initiation fee they require Simply call the customer service number at the agency headquarters and tell they you want to make their company your company and ask for a free membership Next always know what your own insurance and credit cards will cover and do not allow yourself to be beaten up by some counter agent who gets to pocket part of the insurance premium and upgrade they sell you Finally with thousands of various prices for the same car always ask for the best deal and remember when you get to the airport and see signs that say Cars Available that really means Lets Deal Your reading assignment is

Travel We will resume the frugal travel course next week Detroits new terminal opens Part Two The New Continued from last week For the complete story click on link below Up at the crack of dawn I checked in at Indy and spoke with other travelers about the new digs in Detroit All had horror stories about the old terminal and one recounted the days prior to the moving walkways when a trip from the ticket counter to the C concourse was indeed minutes for the hale and hearty Enough talk about the old terminal on to the new We arrived a little early at Detroits NWA World Gate Way and there was some confusion getting to the gate but I suspect that was just first day jitters as ground controllers learned how to move aircraft in a corridor free environment The main stream press reported how Richard Anderson CEO of Northwest was on hand to greet the first few flights He didnt greet ours when it arrived at AM must have seen my name on the manifest Our arrival gate A was near the center of the terminal and my connecting flight was out of A literally over a half mile away However the elevated tram that runs the length of the terminal was just a few feet away allowing the journey from A to A to be accomplished in under five minutes This alone sold me I intentionally planned the trip to allow three hours to really get to know the new facility I had been invited on a press tour but knew we would be shown what they wanted us to see and report aboutthe five Ws of course I wanted to see what travelers saw after all thats who it was built for wasnt it Remember my arrival was on a Sunday an off travel day but things went very smoothly Not all the shops were open but it was easy to see that one could buy just about anything they had forgotten to pack including a Brooks Brothers suit Heck if you were really late and couldnt pack you could buy and fill a bag right there Restrooms were everywhere It was impossible to not see at least two for each gender simultaneously Newsstands were every paces and a food court at the north end of the terminal covers you from soup to nuts Mid terminal the main entry and exit point for travelers beginning or ending their journey in Detroit contains a huge wate r sculpture This should make an ideal meeting place if people dont decide to use it all at once For the complete story click on the link below

Travel Students We will resume the frugal travel course in two weeks Detroits new terminal opens Part One The Old Sometimes as I sit and read articles in news papers and other publications I just wonder why my fellow writers extol things like the cost of a terminal number of gates whether or not you can buy a suit of clothes or the number of seats set aside for caf dining You get the dimensions who built it what it replaced and why along with all sorts of other facts and figures Which by the way are virtually useless to travelers Last year the airport code DTW appeared on my boarding passes times Once every days I was in the old Detroit terminal going from one flight to another Usually hauling kids and their toys along the way Coming into the International Terminal and connecting out of C was an exercise in frustration Believe me an hour from international to domestic was often not enough I listened as the pilots came on the intercom to tell us that It will be just a minute folks before we push back from the gate because of traffic in the corridor behind us Usually the minute was ten and capable of stretching to or Bathrooms in the old terminal were few and far between I honestly dont recall a time I didnt see a line at the womans bathroom during peak hours so I would have to wait with my six yearold daughter since she was past the age of using the mens room Things like these and more were areas of concern to me the real traveler not how high the roof i s or what supports it or how many tiles were used in the ceiling So how does the new terminal stack up Phenomenally To really do the comparison I flew from Grand Rapids to Indianapolis the evening of the rd Of course we arrived early in Detroit for the connection and had to wait for a gate Passing through the old terminal I noticed business as usual heavy crowds even on a Saturday afternoon Things were in boxes behind the podiums ready to be moved and a sense of anticipation was afoot As I passed the entrance to the elevator that took NWA pilots and flight attendants to down to their lounge many remarked that this would be their last trip to the dungeon I boarded my flight to Indianapolis we had to wait for traffic behind us to clear the corridor Ten minutes later we were on our way Next week the New Terminal See you on a Detroit flight soon Bob ADDITIONAL STEALS AND DEALS

upto theminute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip The Sale that would not die Each week I tell myself that the airfare sales will endbut they just dont Its kind of like watching a Halloween movie Jason will pop out The strangest part of these sales now is that most are unadvertised There once was a time when an airline would float a fare to see if other carriers would match it and if others did not the price would be pulled in a few minutes Note Airlines have staff assigned whose only job is to watch pricing at other airlines Times have changed in this regard as carriers are going their own way in spite of some joint marketing outlets which sell excess or distressed inventory Their own yield management computers are making decisions and probably suggesting sales and promotions Again many times these sales are transparent to the consumer as they are not truly advertised and people just stumble on themlike yesterday My wife has to take a Government business trip to Kansas City in April I had booked her ticket for a not unreasonable price of Early the next day she called me to tell me she would have to stay an extra day Since the reservation was less than hours old a change or cancellation would be easy When I looked at the fare online it had dropped some and the trip she was taking the following week had dropped Talk about found money I immediately called the airline changed the one reservation and requested an MCO a voucher for future travel for the fare difference The one reservation less than hours old was simply reissued and the difference in price was credited back to my credit card In the past I have made it a point to check prices on reservations I hold every Friday morning This is largely due to sales that hit the streets overnight on Thursday But the point here and one to be well taken is simply this Had I not changed the reservation the following day the envelope I keep vouchers in would be shorter Moral of the story Check your reservations at least once a day And the sales Well most are extended for travel through August st on domestic flights

MR MAXIMILER Our column from OneTravelcoms own Frugalist Bob Jones features upto theminute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip Mr Max has the answer Whats that I hear Sonny and Cher singing The Beat Goes On Is it a new week new sale or just a new incarnation of last weeks sale Who knows But here is what I think is driving it and what you need to do to take advantage Over the past three weeks my family and I flew a combined segments as we winged our way to Grandmas house in Florida and then off to Rome for New Years Eve We traveled on the th th th and st of December with less than a handful of seats available on any of the flights including the two TransAtlantic legs So if the planes are so full why are the sales continuing you ask Well the way I see it is this While flights over the next two to three weeks are fairly full the long range loading for seats a month or more out is extremely low Travelers seem to be waiting for the next sale to come along before they purchase While this wait for the next Billy Goat may have seemingly worked for the troll in about two months we will be entering a period when folks will be planning their summer vacations and frankly the sales will dry up Remember too that the airlines have cut capacity by some through reduced flights or smaller equipment So friends the bottom line is thisThe time to hesitate is through no time to wallow in the mire time to really start looking at your late spring and early summer travel plans with the sole intent of getting your tickets The current sales will be gone in the next three to five weeks Here are the deals US Airways has cut prices on seven day advance purchase tickets through of January The fares are good for

week columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal TRAVEL LESSON TWO Timing Without a doubt the simplest way to save on travel is through timing Virtually all destinations worldwide have high or peak low and possibly shoulder seasons Timing is important for airfares cruises hotel stays rental cars and rail passes Even when you take your meals can mean a difference in price as many hotels and other restaurants offer early bird specials Airlines will save you money when you travel on specific days during the week Many carriers have reduced fares even in the same fare basis Tuesday through Thursday and all day Saturday The famous Saturday night stay required is also a clue to savings Even time of day can be an important factor as many fares will state that travel after noon on Monday or before AM on Friday gives a lower fare The airlines know when their planes are full and when they need to be filled and they price accordingly Airline seats prices are not like fine wine they do not get better with age so be sure to understand advance purchase requirements Many carriers control their seats so closely with computers programmed to recognize such things as no show rate and historical loading that they can add or remove a fare basis for those seats minute by minute So as mentioned before follow up to ensure you are getting the best price Hotels also tend to price by day of the week A weekend stay at a business hotel like a Marriott in downtown Dallas will be substantially less costly than the same room mid week On the other hand you will find rates at properties that cater to tourists to be higher on the weekend than midweek The rule of thumb here is if occupancy is lower so will be prices as supply far outweighs demand Cruisers can save one half or more if they are willing to sail at the last minute OR book well in advance Rental cars go for much less on the weekend generally Thursday afternoon until Monday noon Finally over the past few years rail passes have been cheaper in the off season as well In addition to the savings you can enjoy with off peak travel you will also find fewer tourists and more travelers such as yourself Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers Corner advisorSTMenucfmTokenNULL chapters titled Timing is Everything and under the Hotels section read How To Get

different day As the old DJs used to say The hits just keep on coming I am beginning to run out of superlatives for the sales we see with the hotels and airlines The packages are unbelievable with prices I didnt think would ever be reached Visitor Bureaus are joining with Chamber of Commerce and are working to get people traveling again Even Mickey has loosened up and is offering deals that dont make you feel like you have walked into the worlds biggest human trap built by a rodent Just kidding Mick We love you Okay here is the lowdown on what is happening Most of the current airline sales end the th or the th of January Travel dates vary but most of the best deals require travel in January and up until mid February There are excellent values beyond this cutoff and well into spring but again the best are for the next days International travel is just as good or better I saw a United fare from JFK New York to Heathrow London UK for throw in the approximately for taxes and fees and you are right around round trip Can you imagine an Asian roundtrip for between and depending on where you live The very first time I flew to Tokyo was in from Seattle The cost then was nearly today it is almost half Hotels are still offering buy one night get a weekend night free Some are doing the pay for three and get the fourth free Prices are down around over the same period last year Some Marriott properties have prices beginning at per night Now understand that this will not get you the Marriott Marquis on Times Square but even this hotel is much cheaper than last year The only travel segment that is not advertising deeply discounted specials is rental cars But even here when you approach the counter negotiate the rate If they stand firm talk upgrade or try the next counter

Choices While this may seem like a strange place to start saving money it can be the most important part of traveling better and more affordably In order to be successful in obtaining reduced fares and rates through discount coupons and special offers you must give special consideration when selecting a travel providers frequency program These programs can offer you valuable travel discounts such as free flights hotel stays and rental car promotions There are several factors in determining which travel partners you choose First examine your travel patterns plans and goals Since most vacations include at least some air travel select an airline alliance that best meets your needs Next you will want a hotel plan that works with the airline plan and optimizes your pointmile earning potential It is important to remember that affinity cards associated with an airline or hotel chain can easily double your miles and points Often times a travel partner will specify offers linked to a specific credit card Consider your telecommunication services in the planning stage as this too can amass points quickly In this group we find local service long distance cell and Internet service Finally rental cars still give points but not as they used to Fifty miles a day is the norm for most agencies so while they dont add up as quickly as other points they will provide some clout as a member of their frequent renter program Now if I were a neophyte I would look long and hard at Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan Their program has some unique features that actually caused me to recommend their plan to a traveler in Miami Why Well their plan allows miles earned on over ten airlines to be deposited into your Mileage Plan account and as an added bonus you can even earn elite status on Alaska without ever having set foot on the fleet with the Aleut on the tail Elite status brings special offers and even reduced award redemption in many cases In addition to airlines you can earn miles by staying at over hotel brands from Best Western to Westmark seven car rental companies and a dozen miscellaneous partners which include Amtrak Sprint and FTDcom make this my best to join program for Full terms conditions and information can be found at click on Mileage Plan at the top of the page Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers Corner

News Click to advisorARAirlineNewsArticlecfmArticleID for the full story MR MAXIMILER Our newest column from OneTravelcoms own Frugalist Bob Jones features uptotheminute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip How to get the most miles out of your flying Identify your likes and dislikes and pick a carrieralliance to meet those needs Once you have a carrier they will do their best to keep you through various promotions and coupons Stick with that carrieralliance even though you might find that another airline beats them by This can become a penny wise pound foolish situation if you are trying to achieve elite status which brings with it additional free miles Join any discount programs for which you qualify or programs like NWAcom Club for further discounts Consider alternative airports served by your alliance whenever you can This can save you hundreds of dollars for a drive of just an hour or so Since you are working with an alliance check the other airline partners That is if you see Continental flights on Onetravelcom they may actually be flights operated by Northwest You buy a ticket on Continental from Onetravelcom and end up flying on your primary carrier Northwest This practice is called code sharing Consider open jaw and circle routes instead of two oneway or two roundtrip tickets Use rail travel on the open portions of these types of tickets if you can and remember that you can earn miles on a few rail routes depending on your carrier If you do fly four to six roundtrips per year on your carrieralliance it is quite possible to achieve elite status which brings with it additional miles and that wonder of wonders the first class upgrade But most of all in order to get the most benefit from leisure travel and the best price as well be flexible when you travel Next week tips for picking your hotel and rental car partners wisely Happy Contrails Bob Mr Maximiler Jones QUESTIONS

your air miles and save you travel cash Read on for this weeks Mr Maximiler tip How to get the most miles out of your flying Identify your likes and dislikes and pick a carrieralliance to meet those needs Once you have a carrier they will do their best to keep you through various promotions and coupons Stick with that carrieralliance even though you might find that another airline beats them by This can become a penny wise pound foolish situation if you are trying to achieve elite status which brings with it additional free miles Join any discount programs for which you qualify or programs like NWAcom Club for further discounts Consider alternative airports served by your alliance whenever you can This can save you hundreds of dollars for a drive of just an hour or so Since you are working with an alliance check the other airline partners That is if you see Continental flights on Onetravelcom they may actually be flights operated by Northwest You buy a ticket on Continental from Onetravelcom and end up flying on your primary carrier Northwest This practice is called code sharing Consider open jaw and circle routes instead of two oneway or two roundtrip tickets Use rail travel on the open portions of these types of tickets if you can and remember that you can earn miles on a few rail routes depending on your carrier If you do fly four to six roundtrips per year on your carrieralliance it is quite possible to achieve elite status which brings with it additional miles and that wonder of wonders the first class upgrade But most of all in order to get the most benefit from leisure travel and the best price as well be flexible when you travel Next week tips for picking your hotel and rental car partners wisely Happy Contrails Bob Mr Maximiler Jones QUESTIONS
