Polish lawyers would like me to forward to them some information as to the critria Enron use to decide who can and cant trade online I guess that they are wanting to know whether the criteria are basically objective ie based on credit ratings etc or whether they are more subjective In practice what sort of companies do Enron refuse online trading access to Thanks Rachel Original Message From

HansenHOUECT on PM Leslie Hansen AM To Murton Rachel ENRON cc Dave CT Subject Re Enron gameDocument link Leslie Hansen Rachel I dont think were going to be interested in reimbursing for connection costs so I think we should just keep France in the lists of not approved With regard to the data protection issue I have actually sent Justin an email on this various issue to determine if our current legal privacy language is sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules I will forward you that email If you go into the Registration Screen of the demo game you will see that individual participants will be required to enter their name email address and telephone number I look forward to your comments on this issue Leslie Murton Rachel rachel inkl aterscom AM To cc Didizian Marly Subject Enron game Dear Leslie France I have now read through the French advice The DGCCRF lottery regulators have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet communication This means that the game probably does fall foul of French lottery legislation One way round this might be to offer to reimburse connection costs If this is done then there are still a couple of indirect contribution issues to sort out these relate to being seen not to promote Enron and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions although French law on these matters is generally stricter There is also a possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed to adjudicate in the case of disupute but I get the impression from the French advice that this could probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible if it isnt then there is presumably little point in tidying up the indirect contribution and bailiff issues The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded ie there must be an expectation of profitgain Hence in theory not awarding the prize to a French resident should allow the game to be played in France The French lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically I am not sure I understand their concerns and have asked them for clarification I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies together with employees of other Enron Customers for example UK companies who happen to reside in France I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification that such exclusions would suffice and will forward you the essence of their replies I set out below a list of countries where the game would be lawful providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country Netherlands Belgium Sweden France subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns Italy As mentioned in my previous email some of these countries may move into the approved list anyway I have not received express advice on this particular issue from Norway but there advice implies that not awarding prizes would be ok and if the tax issue scan be sorted out Norway may move to the approved list anyway I will however ask them to confirm the not awarding prizes point for completeness I have not received advice on this point from Spain You may recall that for the Euro game colleagues in Belgium were concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents then this needs to be made very clear from an early stage so that Enron are not misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be awarded a prize if they are not going to be If ineligbility for prizes is placed prominently in the rules and partcipants have to read the rules before playing then I guess that this covers this issue Although none of the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point I think it would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an online registration process are Spain based on previous Euro advice Italy Netherlands Denmark Sweden Belgium but note the comments made re Euro that there is a very slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential difficulties ie Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium participants had been properly advised of their ineligibility Belgium law requires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers Rules I have not had chance to review the rules in detail One issue that may be important from a European point of view is data protection ie protection of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to trnsfer data I will look into this and let you know As mentioned above the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need to be included in the eligibility section Miscellaneous One issue which was touched upon in a previous email was whether the word Olympic could be used in a disclaimer I will look into this further and get back to you on this matter next week As requested I will summarize the Olympic advice for you also Regards Rachel This message is confidential It may also be privileged or otherwise protected by work product immunity or other legal rules If you have
