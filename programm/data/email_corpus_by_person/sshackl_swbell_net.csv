INDICATE YOUR PREFERRED METHOD OF PAYMENT Unless you tell us otherwise we will charge the credit card number you have on file with us as of the close of the auction If you have changed your credit card since please let us know If you would prefer to send a check or use a wire transfer please see the procedure for doing so below IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of wine from winebidcom please make a copy of your proof of age and mail it to winebidcom PO Box Napa CA with your shipping authorization FAX THE PRINTED CONFIRMATION TO or mail it to winebidcom PO Box Napa CA AS WE MUST PAY OUR SELLERS IN A TIMELY MANNER IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION WITHIN DAYS OF THE AUCTION CLOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE WILL BE CHARGED HOWEVER WE CAN NOT SHIP YOUR WINE UNTIL WE RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION AND PROOF OF AGE Once weve received your faxed confirmation we will charge your credit card for the hammer price of the wine the premium sales tax if applicable and shipping insurance We will charge the shipping and handling when the wine is actually shipped If you have purchased wine from both our West Coast and Midwest storage and service facilities we will transfer the wine to the facility closest to your shipping address by temperaturecontrolled truck to consolidate your shipment Following are answers to some common questions regarding our service and our procedures after the auction has closed HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SHIP MY WINE Because of the complexity in sorting individual bottles from hundreds of consignors for shipment to thousands of different customers as well as the time it takes to transfer wine between our facilities please allow two to three weeks after we receive your faxed confirmation before expecting shipment If you have an urgent need for the wine please drop us an email at and well attempt to accommodate your request Please also see the information on weather below WHAT ABOUT TEMPERATURE ISSUES Prior to shipping any wine winebidcoms customer service staff checks the weather forecast at our shipping facility and at your delivery zip code If the forecast is too warm or too cold we will hold the shipment until the weather is more favorable We only ship second day air shipments during the first half of the week so your wine wont sit in the shippers warehouse over the weekend For older vintages or very high value wines we recommend that you arrange to pick up the wine at one of our facilities or use a ground carrier with temperaturecontrolled trucks to minimize the risk of damage Older corks have a tendency to fail during air shipments HOW IS MY WINE SHIPPED We recommend the use of twoday service to ship your wines to minimize the time the wine is exposed to temperature extremes on a truck or in a warehouse If you would like to use next day service or standard ground service please let us know and well provide a revised estimate of shipping charges All international shipments are sent by air IS THE WINE INSURED Yes Winebidcom has found that UPS FedEx and other shippers frequently do not honor claims for damaged wine shipments so we have purchased and arranged for outside insurance coverage and provide it to all of our customers at a rate of of the hammer price of the wine This insurance is mandatory and is administrated by winebidcom If your shipment suffers loss damage or breakage please contact our customer service department to make a claim Our insurance does not cover claims of spoilage or damage from heat or cold during shipment HOW CAN I SAVE MONEY ON FREIGHT CHARGES We strongly recommend that fine and rare wines be shipped by air Given the weight of wine this can be expensive If you would like us to use less expensive ground shipment let us know Also if your purchase from this auction is for less than a full case consider allowing us to store your wine until it can be combined with purchases from future auctions to make a single larger shipment Sending multiple shipments of one or two bottles at a time is far less efficient than shipping full case lots INVOICE Michael McKeogh Daytime Tel Fax Number Email Billing Michael McKeogh Poydras Suite New Orleans LA

WHICH YOU HAVE WINNING BIDS Below you will find an invoice for the lots you won in this auction along with the estimated charges for shipping packaging and insurance Follow these steps to expedite your order PRINT OUT THIS EMAIL VERIFY THAT YOUR BILLING AND SHIPPING ADDRESSES ARE SHOWN CORRECTLY or make any necessary changes to them Choose your shipping address carefully although we use our

INDICATE YOUR PREFERRED METHOD OF PAYMENT Unless you tell us otherwise we will charge the credit card number you have on file with us as of the close of the auction If you have changed your credit card since please let us know If you would prefer to send a check or use a wire transfer please see the procedure for doing so below IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of wine from winebidcom please make a copy of your proof of age and mail it to winebidcom PO Box Napa CA with your shipping authorization FAX THE PRINTED CONFIRMATION TO or mail it to winebidcom PO Box Napa CA AS WE MUST PAY OUR SELLERS IN A TIMELY MANNER IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION WITHIN DAYS OF THE AUCTION CLOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE WILL BE CHARGED HOWEVER WE CAN NOT SHIP YOUR WINE UNTIL WE RECEIVE YOUR SIGNED CONFIRMATION AND PROOF OF AGE Once weve received your faxed confirmation we will charge your credit card for the hammer price of the wine the premium sales tax if applicable and shipping insurance We will charge the shipping and handling when the wine is actually shipped If you have purchased wine from both our West Coast and Midwest storage and service facilities we will transfer the wine to the facility closest to your shipping address by temperaturecontrolled truck to consolidate your shipment Following are answers to some common questions regarding our service and our procedures after the auction has closed HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO SHIP MY WINE Because of the complexity in sorting individual bottles from hundreds of consignors for shipment to thousands of different customers as well as the time it takes to transfer wine between our facilities please allow two to three weeks after we receive your faxed confirmation before expecting shipment If you have an urgent need for the wine please drop us an email at and well attempt to accommodate your request Please also see the information on weather below WHAT ABOUT TEMPERATURE ISSUES Prior to shipping any wine winebidcoms customer service staff checks the weather forecast at our shipping facility and at your delivery zip code If the forecast is too warm or too cold we will hold the shipment until the weather is more favorable We only ship second day air shipments during the first half of the week so your wine wont sit in the shippers warehouse over the weekend For older vintages or very high value wines we recommend that you arrange to pick up the wine at one of our facilities or use a ground carrier with temperaturecontrolled trucks to minimize the risk of damage Older corks have a tendency to fail during air shipments HOW IS MY WINE SHIPPED We recommend the use of twoday service to ship your wines to minimize the time the wine is exposed to temperature extremes on a truck or in a warehouse If you would like to use next day service or standard ground service please let us know and well provide a revised estimate of shipping charges All international shipments are sent by air IS THE WINE INSURED Yes Winebidcom has found that UPS FedEx and other shippers frequently do not honor claims for damaged wine shipments so we have purchased and arranged for outside insurance coverage and provide it to all of our customers at a rate of of the hammer price of the wine This insurance is mandatory and is administrated by winebidcom If your shipment suffers loss damage or breakage please contact our customer service department to make a claim Our insurance does not cover claims of spoilage or damage from heat or cold during shipment HOW CAN I SAVE MONEY ON FREIGHT CHARGES We strongly recommend that fine and rare wines be shipped by air Given the weight of wine this can be expensive If you would like us to use less expensive ground shipment let us know Also if your purchase from this auction is for less than a full case consider allowing us to store your wine until it can be combined with purchases from future auctions to make a single larger shipment Sending multiple
