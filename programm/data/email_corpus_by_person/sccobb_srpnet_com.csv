<9684209.1075840021496.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sccobb@srpnet.com,2002-01-31 01:05:15,RE ISAS Meeting Agenda appreciate your input The OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective We need to do our best to satisfy their request Our goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can ISAS has always had voting members These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Subcommittees reporting to the OC An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from hisher company In at least one case in the WSCC an individual company has two OC members One member represents the transmissionreliability side and one member represents the merchant side Diverse opinions often lead to the best decisions The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions Nonvoting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views However the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting However these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction The Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces The proposed revision is attached Thanks Original Message From Winn Robert mailto Sent Wednesday January PM To ISAS Correspondents Subject RE ISAS Meeting Agenda Steve We have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member As you know in PNMs case and others we have only one WSCC membership Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks issues insights and etc Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other We are concerned that by limiting discussions to only the voting member much insight will be lost We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums ESC GISB NAERO NAESB and etc where a company represented in WSCC would have votingdiscussion privileges for representatives from each business sector In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability andor a Merchant repif applicable even if the company holds only one WSCC membership I do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities I have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees Work Groups And Task Forces which you indicated was being revised I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on the WSCC web sitecould you provide a name As you know this document has not been modified since We would like to make sure the revisions reflect the needs of all the industry as we know it today We have some thoughts and concerns which we would like considered in the revision process Thanks Bob Winn PNM Original Message From mailto Sent Friday January PM To ISAS Correspondents Subject ISAS Meeting Agenda ISAS Members and Guests Attached is the agenda package for the February meeting The hotel has extended the room availability through Thanks WSCC Meeting pdf ISAS February Meeting

<10697954.1075840021445.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,sccobb@srpnet.com,2002-02-03 20:22:26,ETag Spec Concernsand Interested Parties Last week Raymond Vojdani raised some very valid concerns about the ETag Specification SRP found some time to research these issues Our comments are attached Raymond Thanks for bringing these issues to the WSCCs attention Original Message From RAYMOND VOJDANI mailto Sent Monday January PM To Interchange Scheduling Accounting Subcommittee ISAS Subject Re ETag Test Procedure Hi Steve As we approach the impending implementation of ETag we have begun reviewing and studying the new features of the Tag Services interface as explained at the NERC Workshops and as developed by our vendor OATI The implementation of the ETag Specifications has raised some questions On the section of the tag where the PSE creates the Physical Path for the transaction there are required fields for the Generating Control Area the Load Control Area and the intermediate Transmission Providers There is not a requirement to document the intermediate Control Areas there is a location to include them as Scheduling Entities but those fields are optional This would seem to be a significant obstacle to providing all Control Areas the information they need to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring Control Areas Also in WSCC where certain Control Areas are responsible for managing constrained paths this would be an obstacle in determining scheduled flows across the constrained paths It is possible even likely to create tags where the Control Area would not see the tag because the transmission used is owned by Transmission Providers other than the Control Area Was it the intent of the NERC ETag Specification to remove intermediate Control Areas from visibility and approval of the tags Once an ETag has been approved and has achieved the Implement state it appears to have immortality Even when the final hour of the current version of the tag has passed the tag does not appear to be inactive it is available for the creating PSE to access and extend by an Adjust request This feature could potentially bog our system down with numerous tags that are presently inactive but always available for adjusting Did the NERC specifications intend for an Implemented tag to eventually become inactive and unavailable for adjustment A related concern to tag Adjustment Requests under ETag a PSE may now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the Extension of the tag by adjusting oh boy account number scheduling has returned At the NERC ETag Training Workshop the Timing Requirement for Profile Changes WSCC is minutes to evaluate any early notice This could be a significant business change the PSE can accomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions minutes evaluation time rather than creating new tags hour evaluation time The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and Real Time schedules is being lost Perhaps the evaluation time of an any Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time of that change request similar to the timing requirements for submission and evaluation of New Tag Requests Considering the above shortcomings especially item it is impossible for us to move toward implementation of ETag for we will not be able to check out the net interchange with our neighboring control areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control area Please give me a call should you have any question or if you want to discuss this further Thanks Raymond Raymond R Vojdani PE Transmission Scheduling and Security Manager Rocky Mountain Region Western Area Power Administration PM ISAS Members Attached is a draft test procedure for ETag It was created and approved by a small swat team of ISAS members and WSCC Staff Please review this draft procedure and provide any comments you may have by MST Tuesday January Thanks ETag Functionality Test Ver doc
