in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are welcomed Problem There is uncertainty about EESs ability to pursue what had been perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power AEP and Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves These changes reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns regarding load following and imbalances Proposed Solution Negotiate a power swap with AEP andor Cinergy How the Proposal Works Under the proposal EESI would enter into a contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit thereby offering savings to the customer EESI would then enter into a contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it currently does similar to the market support generation concept EESI could agree to pay AEP a modest sum a few milskwh for example as an incentive to do the deal EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to procure on peak and off peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer minus a percentage or millage which would be EESIs profit on the deal ENA would contract with AEP to provide the onpeak and offpeak power in the same quantities as AEP is providing to EESI customers The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO adequately addresses load following whichever comes first The amount of the capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up to the amound required to get AEP to its Why AEP Might Consider the Deal Currently there is no customer switching in the AEP service territory Under SB if less than of the customers switch by the end of then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to address why The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek If no switching continues to be the issue the Commission could take action sooner Also under SB if of customers switch anytime after mid any party including the utility can petition the Commission to go to market based rates and end the market development transition period It is my belief that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as possible for two reasons First they have very little stranded generation assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in Their Regulatory Asset Charge which is where all there stranded costs really are is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the Market Development Period ends The most compelling reason for AEP to consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low rates This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return Finally the swap leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder EESI could add to the deal is just extra profit for them Benefits to EESI EESI gets to do its deals make a profit and get a strong foothold in the Ohio market EESI also gets a competitive edge over other marketers by securing physical capability Third by moving AEP more quickly to market based rates this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron thrives on Fourth once AEP goes to marketbased rates they are required to conduct a competitive bid for default service This could potentially accelerate by as much as two and a half years the opportuntity for an EESI play as the default service provider Benefit to ENA This provides ENA a large longterm wholesale transaction ENAs profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA as described above and the price at which it procures the power Benefit to Customers The customers get the benefit of lower rates and savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and the price negotiated with EESI They are indifferent as to the source of the power Next Steps Assuming this looks like an idea that can work I would set up a lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski Senior VP who negotiated the settlements to explore this concept with him Rich is very practical and very bottomline oriented If he thinks this is good for AEP he might be willing to carry the water internally on this Judging from several years of negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere I think there is a reasonable chance he would be receptive I could also arrange a similar meeting with Jim Gainer VP legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements I have a good relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward If he thinks this has merit he will take it up with Jim Turner president of Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company who I also have a good relationship with although not as close Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions Thank you Janine

out Additional thoughts that may not have been fully articulated in my first email and which Mike Roan and I discussed this morning To get CSP up to the mark we could do a preemptive default service deal whereby we negotiate to take enough of CSPs customers to get them to the within a customer class The deal could be with commercial or residential customers I dont think we could do much with industrials because the shopping credit is fairly low The shopping credits are as follows Residential Nonheat Total Residential Commercial for GS GS GS GS respectively Industrial The customer load by class in CSPs service territory for as estimated in AEPs Longterm Forecast Report is as follows Residential MWH x MWH Commercial MWH x MWH Industrial MWH x MWH The numbers multipled by the switch is

shopping credit for the southern utilities I think this increases are leverage going in to meetings with AEP I would also recommend that we move on Cinergy and strike while the iron is hot On the other hand if we hold off we could get higher shopping credits However the utilities will argue to recover the amount of the increase through the Regulatory Asset Charge Although the stipulations in the cases to the best of my recollection do not provide for this my sense is that they would recover the cost Schribers comments on POLR are also interesting in light of the statute that requires competitive bidding at the end of the Market Development Period I think this summer would be a good time to meet with Schriber to discuss our views on the POLR issue and would welcome feedback from any of you as to what we want to say My inclination for starters is to require separate bids by utility by customer class so that we do not have to mix residential with commercial Also I would argue that that the winning bidder automatically become the POLR and that the utility not be in a position to usurp this role by matching the winning bidders price Other thoughts on how the POLR rate should be structured ie is it based on a market index plus or a fixed price need to be discussed in terms of how you compare bids Also please note the comments on transmission Janine Forwarded by Janine MigdenNAEnron on AM Kerry Stroup AM To Janine nron cc Barbara A nron Subject Schriber testiimony Chairman Schriber testified to the House Public Utilities Committee on May After a very brief overview of his history with SB he focused on the fact not much progress had been made in the southern half of Ohio where customer switching rates were low He stated that inducing shopping will be a major effort of the Commission this coming year although he acknowledged that the effort was likepushing on a string and he expressly stated that the Commission will order higher shopping credits next year Several staff members I spoke to in the afternoon were surprised he had spoken definitively on that issue He also highlighted the MSG controversy before the Commission stating that it was a no win situation for the PUCO Predictably he commented on the differences between California and Ohio pointing out there had been no divestiture in Ohio contrasting bilateral contracts with the Cal PX noting that California limited purchasing to the day ahead and spot markets and claiming that our transmission system was more robust Despite these assurances he expressed a concern over the potential situation at the end of the transition periods when wholesale prices could still be higher than the current capped rate The PUCO he claimed is thinking hard over who will be the provider of last resort and at what price and stated that there will be a need for the POLR to manage their risk by entering into long term arrangements for procuring power Schriber stated that the potential for problems when the market development period ends may be mitigated by the size of the market and the state of the transmission system and asserted the need to push FERC on these issues He expressed comfort about the new generating capacity coming on line in Ohio MW having been added since At the same time he was cautious about the fact that this was gas fired generation On the subject of natural gas Schriber noted that forward prices for gas had fallen to the for next winter He stated that the PUO is contemplating a limited pilot program for next year that would provide opportunities for utilities to hedge their purchases Several legislators asked questions at the end of the presentation The concerns reflected were Commission management of the POLRs market price after the end of the market development Alan had no specific answer other than the fact the PUCO was thinking about this issue Federal plan to utilize eminent domain to bolster the electric transmission system Alan responded by noting Ohios strong transmission siting authority which he believed was preferable to federal exercise of authority On the other hand he noted that some states like Indiana dont have a strong state siting law and in those cases federal exercise of jurisdiction may be necessary He said that if the federal government exercises authority in the manner that Ohio does that would be appropriate Representative Sites was concerned about the sapping of our power supplies by other states and asked what we could do to prevent it Alan responded that we cannot embargo our generating facilities Representative Driehaus asked whether the reluctance of CGE customers to switch was a result of what happened in the gas market in Cincinnati Schriber responded by saying that unlike the gas situation competitive electricity providers were required to be certified by the PUCO

IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE November Enron Continues to Implode Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed By Will McNamara Director Electric Indus try Analysis News item from Reuters Enron Corp NYSE ENE shares fel l sharply in opening trade on Nov after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by next week million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week The shares were down or percent t o just over in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange Th e stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the secondmost acti ve stock on the NYSE As of early morning trading on Nov Enron shares were priced at reportedly their lowest level in nearly years A nalysis To paraphrase Shakespeare Oh what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to Wait I better stop When speaking about Enron I am not prepared to finish that sentence at least at this point Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks but at this junctu re an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigation has ye t to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the pa rt of the Houston trader Enron itself has admitted that its financial reco rds from through the first half of should not be relied upon N evertheless perception is reality and the perception currently in the indu stry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following year s of skirting the truth While negative perception continues to cause damag e to Enrons stock perhaps of more current interest are the developments t hat are more grounded in reality We know Enron has just lowered its third quarter earnings faces a stiff payment of million due within a week in fact and has cast doubt over its Q earnings potential The question o f the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a material a dverse change in the eyes of Dynegy which still aims to buy Enron but wis ely included an exit clause in its purchase contract The other question is what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar A termin ated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enrons al readyweak credit standing and it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputation As has been the case since the firs t of October the ongoing fall of Enron story is changing by the day For background on Dynegys proposed acquisition of Enron and Enrons financia l problems that precipitated the proposal please see my IssueAler t available at wwwscientechcomrci In the interest of time let me s ummarize what is happening at this moment Dynegy rode in as Enrons white knight and plopped down a billion offer a share to buy the company which at the time represented a steal of a price considering that Enron w as priced at almost a share little more than a year ago To some extent this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga In other words the company had gone through a tumultuous year hit its rock bottom but stil l planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy Inc its muchsmal ler rival The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nuptials between the two companies For star ters on Monday Nov Enron submitted its Q report to the SEC whic h was five days late by the way In the report Enron dropped what have t urned out to be several bombshells First Enron disclosed that due to rec ent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moodys Standard Poors and Fitch it has to pay off or refinance by Nov debt it owes t o a third party with which it has a partnership or face nearly billion in additional payments Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt Enron would not disclose who owns the note but we know that the limited partnership includes holdings in CEG Rio a Brazil ian natural gascompany that Enron had planned to sell to raise about million in cash Note that just last week various credit services lowered Enrons senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned tha t further downgrades may occur which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment Reportedly if Enron does not make the million payment b y Nov investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating t he asset for an amount equal to the note payable Enron is presently scramb ling to establish a mutually acceptable amendment with lenders to avoid h aving to issue payment on the debt Along with the acknowledgement of the i mminent payment of million Enron said that any further drop in its cr edit rating might necessitate further payments of billion to other par tnerships the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water T rust Also in the new SEC filing Enron increased its Q loss by cents a share to cents Enron originally reported a Q loss of mill ion but has now raised that figure to million As a minor bright side Enron did increase reported earnings for the first nine months of by a penny to cents a share attributed to adjustments made after the quar ters end However looking forward Enron warned that continuing credit wo rries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings Enron also claims that even still the n umbers contained in the Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen the companys external auditor Thus further revision of the numbers could take place Interestingly there does not seem to be a big question about whether or not Enron can pay the million debt obligation Enron apparently has secured an additional billion in loans from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week In fact within the current SEC filing Enron says that is has billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and net collections Thus some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the million payment if it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders According to the SEC filing Enron also intends to sell off bi llion in noncore businesses that are performing below acceptable rates a nd would use the proceeds to pay off debts although this money would proba bly not be immediately available Again however there is a perception e lement to this development that should be noted Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the co mpanys balance sheets Apparently this nondisclosure was done so that En ron could grow quickly without adding too much debt to its own books or dil uting the value of its stock As has been well documented Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC investigation regarding potential conflict ofissues involving its former CFO News about other financial deals that m ay not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nerv ous about Enrons stock As I said the question of the hour is whether or not Enrons new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer As usual the answer all depends on who you ask Dynegy is remaining mum and r eferring all questions about Enrons financial status to Enron Investors a re rather mixed on the question Some say that the facts disclosed in the Q report do not dramatically change Enrons position from what it was whe n Dynegy launched its acquisition and that the current drop in Enrons stoc k is just a kneejerk response to the media hype surrounding the story Fur ther those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liq uid company and has money coming in from various sources Thus it should h ave no trouble making the million payment From a broad perspective s o one theory goes Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price and the acquisition remains valuable to Dy negy as it will position the combined company as North Americas biggest ma rketer and trader of natural gas and electricity In contrast other inve stors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed Enron s stock has fallen an additional percent which weakens the original acquisition agreement In addition if Enron follows through with the million payment next week or secures additional financing to front this cos t both options alter the companys financial position from when Dynegy mad e its original offer which could be construed as a material adverse chang e Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to purchase New reports indicate many ener gy trading companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enro n for fear about the companys credit concerns Such companies are now part icularly reticent to sell power to Enron for nextday delivery What this m eans in practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enro ns market share which could diminish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place In addition Enrons onc estellar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse alto gether Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this t ime to help Enron out of its financial mess Of course under the acquisiti on agreement Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate billio n assetbacked equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its curr ent financial woes which will be followed by an additional infusion of billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco which owns percent of Dynegy However some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has n ot done anything about Enrons diminishing ability to secure power on the o pen market Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sell ers on the behalf of Enron in a strategy known as sleeving The fact tha t Dynegy has not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some ob servers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron In addition Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov in state court i n Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening The petition re portedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by ag reeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consider ation of other alternatives Enron said it will defend its decision in cour t Moreover Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisiti on agreement The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron i f any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC inve stigation possible litigation against Enron balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enrons Q filing with the SEC impact the companys balance sheet strengths and e arnings forecasts so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds t o terminate the acquisition Clearly this pending deal hinges on the devel opments that will take place over the next few weeks Dynegy ultimately wil l have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and de termine if the oncegolden company still represents a great deal or if pur suing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth An

Janine Kingerski Harry philo gregory MServinvensyscom Cc Landwehr Susan M Hueter Barbara A Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains Article October ComEd seeks rate hike for biz Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators Crains October By Steve Daniels mailto Commonwealth Edison Co is pressing for another big hike in its charges for delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers The Chicago utilitys Aug filing with federal regulators to nearly double transmission rates for carrying electricity over its longhaul highvoltage lines for these customers has triggered opposition from state regulators That request followed a June proposal for a increase in distribution charges for moving power through the utilitys more local lowervoltage wires Crains June That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC If approved the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and distribution costs by about for business customers that leave the utility for competing power suppliers Perhaps more important the new rates would clear the way for delivery charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicagoarea power users in three years when a freeze on ComEds rates expires Transmission and distribution rates account for to of a typical business customers total power bill so a typical bill could rise as much as with these increases Apart from the bottomline hit to businesses ComEd competitors and local government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from offering savings from the utilitys bundled rate AES NewEnergy Inc the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more than customers says of its customers will see their bills increase if both proposals are approved What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the point where bundled utility service is cheaper or its so close that they wouldnt bother choosing an alternative provider says Philip OConnor president of AES NewEnergys Chicago office You cannot have competition being viable when your base of potential customers is so small Arlene Juracek ComEd vicepresident of regulatory and strategic services counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a corresponding decrease in transition fees paid to the utility when customers use another supplier The Aug transmission rate proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEds account methodology in which the utility would wipe off its books more than million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask ratepayers to shoulder that investment again Unjust and unreasonable In its filing with FERC the ICC said the proposed change would result in artificially high transmission rates and an unjust and unreasonable windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers Theyre essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the game says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill ComEd responds that FERC itself in an order last year pushing utilities to combine their transmission assets into large regional networks said utilities could consider changing the accounting method ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of parent company Exelon Corp to receive compensation in accordance with what is permissible by law says Steven T Naumann ComEd vicepresident in charge of transmission services The commission will determine if this is what they meant in their order or if it is not what they meant Meanwhile the city of Chicago frustrated by ComEds resistance to sharing detailed financial data is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an outside audit of ComEds books for The state attorney generals office and the Cook County states attorneys office are joining the city in the petition which could be filed as early as Monday sources say The audit which ComEd opposes would be aimed at separating ordinary maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took in and to beef up its distribution system after acknowledging it had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades The behindthescenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government officials are taking the regulatory proceedings While the new rates affect only those customers in the competitive market theyll be the benchmark used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in when the utilitys bundled rates are no longer frozen Setting the rules The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future are getting set now says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment Basically the next months are going to set an awful lot of the fees for the future Mr Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure ComEd into opening its books but says it wouldnt be necessary if the company agreed to do so voluntarily A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a blanket confidentiality agreement which intervenors in the case including the city arent likely to sign Ms Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs associated with its billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate base But she allows that most of those are minimal treetrimming expenses Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers as well as contractor expenses are included in the rates Theres no free lunch here she says Says Mr Abolt Now its time to sort that all out So lets sort it out David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe North LaSalle Street Suite Chicago Illinois phone fax email The

in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are welcomed Problem There is uncertainty about EESs ability to pursue what had been perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power AEP and Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves These changes reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns regarding load following and imbalances Proposed Solution Negotiate a power swap with AEP andor Cinergy How the Proposal Works Under the proposal EESI would enter into a contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit thereby offering savings to the customer EESI would then enter into a contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it currently does similar to the market support generation concept EESI could agree to pay AEP a modest sum a few milskwh for example as an incentive to do the deal EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to procure on peak and off peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer minus a percentage or millage which would be EESIs profit on the deal ENA would contract with AEP to provide the onpeak and offpeak power in the same quantities as AEP is providing to EESI customers The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO adequately addresses load following whichever comes first The amount of the capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up to the amound required to get AEP to its Why AEP Might Consider the Deal Currently there is no customer switching in the AEP service territory Under SB if less than of the customers switch by the end of then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to address why The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek If no switching continues to be the issue the Commission could take action sooner Also under SB if of customers switch anytime after mid any party including the utility can petition the Commission to go to market based rates and end the market development transition period It is my belief that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as possible for two reasons First they have very little stranded generation assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in Their Regulatory Asset Charge which is where all there stranded costs really are is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the Market Development Period ends The most compelling reason for AEP to consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low rates This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return Finally the swap leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder EESI could add to the deal is just extra profit for them Benefits to EESI EESI gets to do its deals make a profit and get a strong foothold in the Ohio market EESI also gets a competitive edge over other marketers by securing physical capability Third by moving AEP more quickly to market based rates this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron thrives on Fourth once AEP goes to marketbased rates they are required to conduct a competitive bid for default service This could potentially accelerate by as much as two and a half years the opportuntity for an EESI play as the default service provider Benefit to ENA This provides ENA a large longterm wholesale transaction ENAs profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA as described above and the price at which it procures the power Benefit to Customers The customers get the benefit of lower rates and savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and the price negotiated with EESI They are indifferent as to the source of the power Next Steps Assuming this looks like an idea that can work I would set up a lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski Senior VP who negotiated the settlements to explore this concept with him Rich is very practical and very bottomline oriented If he thinks this is good for AEP he might be willing to carry the water internally on this Judging from several years of negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere I think there is a reasonable chance he would be receptive I could also arrange a similar meeting with Jim Gainer VP legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements I have a good relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward If he thinks this has merit he will take it up with Jim Turner president of Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company who I also have a good relationship with although not as close Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions Thank you Janine

shopping credit for the southern utilities I think this increases are leverage going in to meetings with AEP I would also recommend that we move on Cinergy and strike while the iron is hot On the other hand if we hold off we could get higher shopping credits However the utilities will argue to recover the amount of the increase through the Regulatory Asset Charge Although the stipulations in the cases to the best of my recollection do not provide for this my sense is that they would recover the cost Schribers comments on POLR are also interesting in light of the statute that requires competitive bidding at the end of the Market Development Period I think this summer would be a good time to meet with Schriber to discuss our views on the POLR issue and would welcome feedback from any of you as to what we want to say My inclination for starters is to require separate bids by utility by customer class so that we do not have to mix residential with commercial Also I would argue that that the winning bidder automatically become the POLR and that the utility not be in a position to usurp this role by matching the winning bidders price Other thoughts on how the POLR rate should be structured ie is it based on a market index plus or a fixed price need to be discussed in terms of how you compare bids Also please note the comments on transmission Janine Forwarded by Janine MigdenNAEnron on AM Kerry Stroup AM To Janine nron cc Barbara A nron Subject Schriber testiimony Chairman Schriber testified to the House Public Utilities Committee on May After a very brief overview of his history with SB he focused on the fact not much progress had been made in the southern half of Ohio where customer switching rates were low He stated that inducing shopping will be a major effort of the Commission this coming year although he acknowledged that the effort was likepushing on a string and he expressly stated that the Commission will order higher shopping credits next year Several staff members I spoke to in the afternoon were surprised he had spoken definitively on that issue He also highlighted the MSG controversy before the Commission stating that it was a no win situation for the PUCO Predictably he commented on the differences between California and Ohio pointing out there had been no divestiture in Ohio contrasting bilateral contracts with the Cal PX noting that California limited purchasing to the day ahead and spot markets and claiming that our transmission system was more robust Despite these assurances he expressed a concern over the potential situation at the end of the transition periods when wholesale prices could still be higher than the current capped rate The PUCO he claimed is thinking hard over who will be the provider of last resort and at what price and stated that there will be a need for the POLR to manage their risk by entering into long term arrangements for procuring power Schriber stated that the potential for problems when the market development period ends may be mitigated by the size of the market and the state of the transmission system and asserted the need to push FERC on these issues He expressed comfort about the new generating capacity coming on line in Ohio MW having been added since At the same time he was cautious about the fact that this was gas fired generation On the subject of natural gas Schriber noted that forward prices for gas had fallen to the for next winter He stated that the PUO is contemplating a limited pilot program for next year that would provide opportunities for utilities to hedge their purchases Several legislators asked questions at the end of the presentation The concerns reflected were Commission management of the POLRs market price after the end of the market development Alan had no specific answer other than the fact the PUCO was thinking about this issue Federal plan to utilize eminent domain to bolster the electric transmission system Alan responded by noting Ohios strong transmission siting authority which he believed was preferable to federal exercise of authority On the other hand he noted that some states like Indiana dont have a strong state siting law and in those cases federal exercise of jurisdiction may be necessary He said that if the federal government exercises authority in the manner that Ohio does that would be appropriate Representative Sites was concerned about the sapping of our power supplies by other states and asked what we could do to prevent it Alan responded that we cannot embargo our generating facilities Representative Driehaus asked whether the reluctance of CGE customers to switch was a result of what happened in the gas market in Cincinnati Schriber responded by saying that unlike the gas situation competitive electricity providers were required to be certified by the PUCO

shopping credit for the southern utilities I think this increases are leverage going in to meetings with AEP I would also recommend that we move on Cinergy and strike while the iron is hot On the other hand if we hold off we could get higher shopping credits However the utilities will argue to recover the amount of the increase through the Regulatory Asset Charge Although the stipulations in the cases to the best of my recollection do not provide for this my sense is that they would recover the cost Schribers comments on POLR are also interesting in light of the statute that requires competitive bidding at the end of the Market Development Period I think this summer would be a good time to meet with Schriber to discuss our views on the POLR issue and would welcome feedback from any of you as to what we want to say My inclination for starters is to require separate bids by utility by customer class so that we do not have to mix residential with commercial Also I would argue that that the winning bidder automatically become the POLR and that the utility not be in a position to usurp this role by matching the winning bidders price Other thoughts on how the POLR rate should be structured ie is it based on a market index plus or a fixed price need to be discussed in terms of how you compare bids Also please note the comments on transmission Janine Forwarded by Janine MigdenNAEnron on AM Kerry Stroup AM To Janine nron cc Barbara A nron Subject Schriber testiimony Chairman Schriber testified to the House Public Utilities Committee on May After a very brief overview of his history with SB he focused on the fact not much progress had been made in the southern half of Ohio where customer switching rates were low He stated that inducing shopping will be a major effort of the Commission this coming year although he acknowledged that the effort was likepushing on a string and he expressly stated that the Commission will order higher shopping credits next year Several staff members I spoke to in the afternoon were surprised he had spoken definitively on that issue He also highlighted the MSG controversy before the Commission stating that it was a no win situation for the PUCO Predictably he commented on the differences between California and Ohio pointing out there had been no divestiture in Ohio contrasting bilateral contracts with the Cal PX noting that California limited purchasing to the day ahead and spot markets and claiming that our transmission system was more robust Despite these assurances he expressed a concern over the potential situation at the end of the transition periods when wholesale prices could still be higher than the current capped rate The PUCO he claimed is thinking hard over who will be the provider of last resort and at what price and stated that there will be a need for the POLR to manage their risk by entering into long term arrangements for procuring power Schriber stated that the potential for problems when the market development period ends may be mitigated by the size of the market and the state of the transmission system and asserted the need to push FERC on these issues He expressed comfort about the new generating capacity coming on line in Ohio MW having been added since At the same time he was cautious about the fact that this was gas fired generation On the subject of natural gas Schriber noted that forward prices for gas had fallen to the for next winter He stated that the PUO is contemplating a limited pilot program for next year that would provide opportunities for utilities to hedge their purchases Several legislators asked questions at the end of the presentation The concerns reflected were Commission management of the POLRs market price after the end of the market development Alan had no specific answer other than the fact the PUCO was thinking about this issue Federal plan to utilize eminent domain to bolster the electric transmission system Alan responded by noting Ohios strong transmission siting authority which he believed was preferable to federal exercise of authority On the other hand he noted that some states like Indiana dont have a strong state siting law and in those cases federal exercise of jurisdiction may be necessary He said that if the federal government exercises authority in the manner that Ohio does that would be appropriate Representative Sites was concerned about the sapping of our power supplies by other states and asked what we could do to prevent it Alan responded that we cannot embargo our generating facilities Representative Driehaus asked whether the reluctance of CGE customers to switch was a result of what happened in the gas market in Cincinnati Schriber responded by saying that unlike the gas situation competitive electricity providers were required to be certified by the PUCO

out Additional thoughts that may not have been fully articulated in my first email and which Mike Roan and I discussed this morning To get CSP up to the mark we could do a preemptive default service deal whereby we negotiate to take enough of CSPs customers to get them to the within a customer class The deal could be with commercial or residential customers I dont think we could do much with industrials because the shopping credit is fairly low The shopping credits are as follows Residential Nonheat Total Residential Commercial for GS GS GS GS respectively Industrial The customer load by class in CSPs service territory for as estimated in AEPs Longterm Forecast Report is as follows Residential MWH x MWH Commercial MWH x MWH Industrial MWH x MWH The numbers multipled by the switch is the approximation of load that would have to switch to an alternative supplier to freeup CSPs generation and get it to market based rates Please feel free to provide comments and suggestions Janine

Subject AEP Brainstorming Below is a concept to perhaps solve the problem confronting EES and the Ohio market It is a work in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are welcomed Problem There is uncertainty about EESs ability to pursue what had been perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power AEP and Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves These changes reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns regarding load following and imbalances Proposed Solution Negotiate a power swap with AEP andor Cinergy How the Proposal Works Under the proposal EESI would enter into a contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit thereby offering savings to the customer EESI would then enter into a contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it currently does similar to the market support generation concept EESI could agree to pay AEP a modest sum a few milskwh for example as an incentive to do the deal EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to procure on peak and off peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer minus a percentage or millage which would be EESIs profit on the deal ENA would contract with AEP to provide the onpeak and offpeak power in the same quantities as AEP is providing to EESI customers The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO adequately addresses load following whichever comes first The amount of the capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up to the amound required to get AEP to its Why AEP Might Consider the Deal Currently there is no customer switching in the AEP service territory Under SB if less than of the customers switch by the end of then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to address why The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek If no switching continues to be the issue the Commission could take action sooner Also under SB if of customers switch anytime after mid any party including the utility can petition the Commission to go to market based rates and end the market development transition period It is my belief that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as possible for two reasons First they have very little stranded generation assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in Their Regulatory Asset Charge which is where all there stranded costs really are is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the Market Development Period ends The most compelling reason for AEP to consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low rates This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return Finally the swap leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder EESI could add to the deal is just extra profit for them Benefits to EESI EESI gets to do its deals make a profit and get a strong foothold in the Ohio market EESI also gets a competitive edge over other marketers by securing physical capability Third by moving AEP more quickly to market based rates this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron thrives on Fourth once AEP goes to marketbased rates they are required to conduct a competitive bid for default service This could potentially accelerate by as much as two and a half years the opportuntity for an EESI play as the default service provider Benefit to ENA This provides ENA a large longterm wholesale transaction ENAs profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA as described above and the price at which it procures the power Benefit to Customers The customers get the benefit of lower rates and savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and the price negotiated with EESI They are indifferent as to the source of the power Next Steps Assuming this looks like an idea that can work I would set up a lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski Senior VP who negotiated the settlements to explore this concept with him Rich is very practical and very bottomline oriented If he thinks this is good for AEP he might be willing to carry the water internally on this Judging from several years of negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere I think there is a reasonable chance he would be receptive I could also arrange a similar meeting with Jim Gainer VP legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements I have a good relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward If he thinks this has merit he will take it up with Jim Turner president of Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company who I also have a good relationship with although not as close Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions Thank you Janine

Janine Kingerski Harry philo gregory MServinvensyscom Cc Landwehr Susan M Hueter Barbara A Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains Article October ComEd seeks rate hike for biz Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators Crains October By Steve Daniels mailto Commonwealth Edison Co is pressing for another big hike in its charges for delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers The Chicago utilitys Aug filing with federal regulators to nearly double transmission rates for carrying electricity over its longhaul highvoltage lines for these customers has triggered opposition from state regulators That request followed a June proposal for a increase in distribution charges for moving power through the utilitys more local lowervoltage wires Crains June That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC If approved the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and distribution costs by about for business customers that leave the utility for competing power suppliers Perhaps more important the new rates would clear the way for delivery charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicagoarea power users in three years when a freeze on ComEds rates expires Transmission and distribution rates account for to of a typical business customers total power bill so a typical bill could rise as much as with these increases Apart from the bottomline hit to businesses ComEd competitors and local government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from offering savings from the utilitys bundled rate AES NewEnergy Inc the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more than customers says of its customers will see their bills increase if both proposals are approved What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the point where bundled utility service is cheaper or its so close that they wouldnt bother choosing an alternative provider says Philip OConnor president of AES NewEnergys Chicago office You cannot have competition being viable when your base of potential customers is so small Arlene Juracek ComEd vicepresident of regulatory and strategic services counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a corresponding decrease in transition fees paid to the utility when customers use another supplier The Aug transmission rate proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEds account methodology in which the utility would wipe off its books more than million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask ratepayers to shoulder that investment again Unjust and unreasonable In its filing with FERC the ICC said the proposed change would result in artificially high transmission rates and an unjust and unreasonable windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers Theyre essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the game says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill ComEd responds that FERC itself in an order last year pushing utilities to combine their transmission assets into large regional networks said utilities could consider changing the accounting method ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of parent company Exelon Corp to receive compensation in accordance with what is permissible by law says Steven T Naumann ComEd vicepresident in charge of transmission services The commission will determine if this is what they meant in their order or if it is not what they meant Meanwhile the city of Chicago frustrated by ComEds resistance to sharing detailed financial data is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an outside audit of ComEds books for The state attorney generals office and the Cook County states attorneys office are joining the city in the petition which could be filed as early as Monday sources say The audit which ComEd opposes would be aimed at separating ordinary maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took in and to beef up its distribution system after acknowledging it had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades The behindthescenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government officials are taking the regulatory proceedings While the new rates affect only those customers in the competitive market theyll be the benchmark used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in when the utilitys bundled rates are no longer frozen Setting the rules The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future are getting set now says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment Basically the next months are going to set an awful lot of the fees for the future Mr Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure ComEd into opening its books but says it wouldnt be necessary if the company agreed to do so voluntarily A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a blanket confidentiality agreement which intervenors in the case including the city arent likely to sign Ms Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs associated with its billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate base But she allows that most of those are minimal treetrimming expenses Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers as well as contractor expenses are included in the rates Theres no free lunch here she says Says Mr Abolt Now its time to sort that all out So lets sort it out David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe North LaSalle Street Suite Chicago Illinois phone fax email The

To Migden Janine Cc Fein David I CHI Subject Imbalance Issues Janine As you might recall from the memo summarizing the Edison DST proceeding the Illinois Commerce Commission essentially punted on the imbalance issue instead deferring to FERC Attached is the section from our memo that discussed the imbalance issue It is my recollection that the issue of establishing subaccounts was not addressed We will try to confirm this tomorrow As lawyers please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of any further assistance Christopher J Townsend Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle Street Chicago IL direct line direct fax Energy Imbalances Jurisdictional Issues The ARES Coalition Alliant and IIEC argued that the Commission should address energy imbalances in the proceeding Enron and NewEnergy abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly addressed within Edisons OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition the Commission would not address the propriety of FERCs asserted authority over energy imbalance issues The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at some future time Factual Policy Issues Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers containing the following provisions Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hours imbalances For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is or less or MW or less settlement is made at of outofpocket costs OPC regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed of their own individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of of OPC Adjustments are made to avoid doublecounting of adders and discounts applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount below These imbalance charges will be phasedin as follows From October through December No adder will apply under this provision From January through March adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Starting April adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs If the hourly imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load excluding PPO load is within the MW bandwidth no RES except those whose imbalance exceeds as noted below will be subject to an adder or discount PPO load will in aggregate be subject to the same terms and conditions as above but imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a MW deadband separately from all RES load Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish before applying a charge for energy imbalance According to Edison this feature will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging overscheduled megawatthours for underscheduled megawatthours in the same hour All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at of Edisons OPC Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the opening of the trading window The net retail energy imbalance in excess of MW will be charged an adder or discount of This charge will be allocated among RESs who are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds their individual deadband The allocation will be based on the ratioshare of the amount by which these individual RESs imbalances exceed their individual deadbands Any such adderdiscount will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Likewise any adderdiscount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with seasonal adjustments Edison will not require the installation of interval demand recorders for customers of less than kW at this time Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth ie no addersdiscounts when the imbalances are due to Edison interruptions and restorations or customer force majeure events that are in each case material to the RESs schedule and of which the RES could not reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC The IIEC opposed Edisons proposal and requested that the Commission require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution level Blackhawk also opposed Edisons proposal and supported the IIEC proposal Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy imbalance service at the distribution level MidAmerican opposed any effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances The Commission failed to weighin on the energy imbalance issue consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for such issues The

start As you recall I sent out a request for information last week to a few of you in the field asking for the following a summary of the stakeholders who are raising concerns with the FERC RTO model an outline of their argumentscriticismsconcerns and a list of priority issues that need addressing The feedback was tremendous and it included useful comments in regard to how we might better improve the delivery of our RTO message Due to the increasing concerns and waivering support among Members of Congress Governors state utility commissions legislators and other stakeholder groups in regard to the FERC RTO model it is imperative that we develop a sound strategy and strong arguments around the RTO issue Toward that end I have summarized your comments and am coordinating with our friends at Tabors Caramanis and Frontier Economics on the development of materials that can be used in your upcoming meetings with stakeholders The first set of documents will address the following issues A sidebyside graphic of the FERC RTO model v the utility RTOs accompanied by an explanation of power flows that builds on Tabors Caramanis work on natural markets which support the FERC model Reliability Document this document will start with a brief history of the NY blackouts the states inability to deal with reliability and how and why the federal government became involved the role of NERC The synopsis will finally address the red herrings associated with reliability issues and the benefits to reliability as a result of implementing the FERC model It will also briefly address control issues for states and realtime reliability Economics This summary will show examples of historical cost savings of aggregation it will highlight cost savings potential and also identify peculiar leftover costs of how certain systems grew and the costs were never eradicated The Hit List This document will address issues such as environmental arguments eminent domain implementation issues cost shifts to people during transitions infrastructuresoftware concerns and other issues that are raised as a reasons not to implment the FERC RTO The welldesigned RTO Using specific analogies we will outline how other similar interstate issues work the shortterm and longterm issues to planning reasons to avoid balkanization and we will identify the key elements of a welldesigned RTO Governance Issues Here we will address the issue of independent boards not beholden to commission interests well show how the state isnt really losing control that in fact there will be a diminished role for commissions and legislators well attempt to distinguish between regional led organizations v institutional using water issuesplanning in the Northwest as an example Well draw from history and look at NE and PJM and how organizations like NECPUC were formed Environmental Issues Were first going to develop an outline to see whether a document is necessary But some of the issues to be addressed are air quality benefits and NIMBY issues Understand that the above is a simplified and very narrow list of issues It is not an exhaustive list of what we need to address its only a start based on your comments I will coordinate with TC and FE on timeframe for delivery but I am expecting a draft set of documents by September th I will identify approximately people from our RTO Team to review the draft documents and weigh in with comments I will provide everyone with a set of final documents by midSeptember AS PART OF OUR RTO ADVOCACY EFFORT I WILL BE ASSIGNING WEEKLY DELIVERABLES
