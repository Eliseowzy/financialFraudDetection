trying to determine the timeframe in which you want to respond to Steve From Cynthia Sandherr PM To Cindy NRON cc Gwendolyn NRON Subject Career Advancement Dear Cindy It occurred to me that I should share some addition thoughts and concerns with you regarding my situation First and foremost as I tried to make clear during our recent meeting with Steve Kean it is my desire to stay with the company I have invested over years with Enron and feel that I have made substantial contributions to its success However I continue to be frustrated over the fact that I have been demoted and that there has been no response to or acknowledgement of my application for Joe Hillings position If I am in fact not going to be considered for the position I believe I am owed the courtesy of knowing that I would also argue that I have made significant progress in addressing the communication issues that have of recent concern to Steve I have had a number of productive sessions with Jocelyne Gessner PhD of Personnel Decisions International on successful executive relations and management and she informs me that in her view my deficiencies as perceived by Steve in that area may have been overstated Dr Gessner has made numerous attempts to call Steve to discuss my progress in a tripartite conversation and he has not been responsive While I recognize that Steve is extremely busy it seems to me that if he as he stated during our meeting really wants me to stay with the company he would make it a point to determine if the issues of his concern were being addressed If he is not interested in garnering feedback about my sessions one could reasonably conclude that the perceived communications problem is merely a pretext It also continues to concern me that the restructuring of the Washington office has been done without any written changes to my job description Many people within Enron with whom I have had a longstanding relationship continue to ask me for lobbying assistance on various issues because they have been satisfied with the results that I have obtained for them in the past Because some of those issues are now not my primary or secondary area of responsibility per the new organizational chart I have been compelled to refer those inquiries and requests to others In doing so I fear that this could create a misperception that I am unwilling to provide customer service to others in the company I am sure that you would agree this could in the long run hurt my chances for increased compensation and advancement The present legislative activity on a number of highprofile Enron legislative issues including the companys top priority of electricity restructuring has precluded me from formally responding to Steves separation offer While I recognize that it was made in good faith and that it provides a basis for further discussions I would like to respond after the House and Senate markups of the electricity bill take place In the meantime I would welcome
