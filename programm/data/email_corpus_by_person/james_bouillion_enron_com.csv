claims made basis As noted in my earlier comments I find no retroactive date in the policy If i renews with different underwriters the retroactive date should remain the same If renewal is with the same underwriters the date normally stays the same If they decide not to renew for whatever reason they should at a minimum provide a runoff period or tail for the reporting of claims as a result of wrongful acts committed while the coverage was in effect I will leave the contractual commitment to renew to Mr Lay and his attorneys As mentioned in my voice mail the carriers are acceptable security We were not provided enough information on i to comment on the adequacy of the limit We did note that Enrons program could apply as excess insurance if Mr Lay is serving at the request of Enron The indemnity provided by an organisation to their Ds and Os is normally found in the Company bylaws If sued the director or officer would first seek protection from the Companys indemnity If the indemnity does not respond the claim is made directly against the insurance subject to the policy terms and conditions Most DO matters are covered by the companys indemnity and the claim is subject to the deductible under the Corporate reimbursement section of the DO policy Normally the direct coverage has no deductible The contractual matter should be handled by counsel It is normal in this type policy for the application to form a part of the policy Polling the Ds and Os at renewal will at least ensure that all claims are reported See comment above Employees are covered only when they are sued along with a director or officer except for the Employment Practices Coverage where employees are covered along with directors and officers Please call if you or Mr Baird wish to discuss further James Derrick ENRON PM To James L CT cc Subject i Technologies FYI Forwarded by James DerrickCorpEnron on PM Baird Bob on PM To Derrick James Enron HARRIS STEPHANIE J Email cc Backus Marcia Subject i Technologies Jim Here are our comments on the i Technologies insurance policy This is a combination of my comments and Marcia Backus comments and in fact Marcia gets the vast bulk of the credit I found out that she has considerable experience in this area This is a claims made policy Apparently they are all this way Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on the board We didnt attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are adequate in light of the companys business or whether the carriers are solid I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than we do See item E on page of It appears that the effect of the language is that the deductible applies if theres any case where the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some reason other than insolvency it does not indemnify Ken This appears to be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company doesnt say to Ken Hey youll be fine and well come out ahead if you agree that we wont indemnify you you can just collect from the insurance company with no deductible and well be better off because if we indemnify you well have a deductible This provision may make sense from an insurance policy standpoint but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted by law Please note exclusion on page of This provision is designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from the insurance company Again this points up that Ken needs a contractual commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted by law The application for the policy is part of the policy which apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the policy itself may be void not only against the Company that applied for the policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and directors which dilutes the coverage somewhat Generally this appears to us to be an ok policy I would be very interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment Robert S Baird Vinson Elkins LLP One American Center Congress Austin Texas Telephone When
