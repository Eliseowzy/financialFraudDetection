other emails are not addressed to me indeed a major concern of mine which clearly slowed down the execution of this package of agreements was that I was not included in conversations about the status

turned the agreements over to me at pm on Friday the th and I began at that time a legal review of the agreements Moreover no one represented to me at that time that this agreement had to be done first and right away I just learned that last week from the business people when I reported that the Morgan agreements were ready for execution I had completed my review of the other two Enron Credit

other emails are not addressed to me indeed a major concern of mine which clearly slowed down the execution of this package of agreements was that I was not included in conversations about the status and any change in deadlines etc Perhaps in part that is because for the bulk of the time period in which we worked on Enron Credit Inc you took responsibility for the Bear Stearns agreements until you turned the agreements over to me at pm on Friday the th and I began at that time a legal review of the agreements Moreover no one represented to me at that time that this agreement had to be done first and right away I just learned that last week from the business people when I reported that the Morgan agreements were ready for execution I had completed my review of the other two Enron Credit
