after all The xrays and CAT scan show no signs of a fracture even though all symptoms indicated such a break His pain is gone and this morning he was able to stand up in the hospital room Later today they are going to do an MRI and a Bone Scan on him to see what might have caused the pain and lack of movement in his leg Please continue to keep Gordon Martin in your prayers and Praise God that his hip is not broken bert Promises by Dr Bill Bright September His Word Remains Forever Scripture Matthew biblelanguageenglishversionNIVpassageMatth ew Heaven and earth will disappear but my words remain forever Therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come Commentary In a day of change and turmoil the promise is made that the word of God will stand forever The significance of that guarantee is monumental incredible It is not just that a book shall remain in print rather it is that the multitudinous truths contained in that book likewise will remain in effect steadfast and true Long after heaven and earth have passed away Gods holy Word will continue to endure That should mean much to you and me in our daily walk Gods promise All things work together for good to the believer is just as true today as it was when it was written centuries ago In fact every one of the promises in the Word of God including the referred to in this daily devotional is bona fide guaranteed by the God of the universe the Creator of all things That alone should strengthen our faith to know that we can trust him supremely with our lives and everything concerned with them When all else fails when hope is almost gone we can come back to the Word of God which is quick and powerful and sharper than a twoedged sword It will have the answer for every problem every burden every need we face Prayer The hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth O God the author of peace to know You is eternal life and to serve You is perfect freedom Defend us Your humble servants in all assaults of our enemies that we trusting in Your defense may not fear the power of any adversaries through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord We celebrate our creation preservation and all the blessings of this life but above all for Your immeasurable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ for the means of grace and for the hope of glory And we pray give us such an awareness of Your mercies that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth Your praise not only with our lips but in our lives by giving up our selves to Your service and by walking before You in holiness and righteousness all our days through Jesus Christ our Lord to whom with You and the Holy Spirit be honor and glory throughout all ages Amen TODAYS ACTION POINT I will place my complete confidence in Gods unchanging Word and will rest upon His faithful promises to all believers for supernatural living Praise Report and Prayer

church worship service on Sunday Dear Lord Were still hoping well wake up Were still hoping well open a sleepy eye and think What a horrible dream But we wont will we Father What we saw was not a dream Planes did gouge towers Flames did consume our fortress People did perish It was no dream and dear Father we are sad There is a ballet dancer who will no longer dance and a doctor who will no longer heal A church has lost her priest a classroom is minus a teacher Cora ran a food pantry Paige was a counselor and Dana dearest Father Dana was only three years old Who held her in those final moments We are sad Father For as the innocent are buried our innocence is buried as well We thought we were safe Perhaps we should have known better But we didnt And so we come to you We dont ask you for help we beg you for it We dont request it we implore it We know what you can do Weve read the accounts Weve pondered the stories and now we plead Do it again Lord Do it again Remember Joseph You rescued him from the pit You can do the same for us Do it again Lord Remember the Hebrews in Egypt You protected their children from the angel of death We have children too Lord Do it again And Sarah Remember her prayers You heard them Joshua Remember his fears You inspired him The women at the tomb You resurrected their hope The doubts of Thomas You took them away Do it again Lord Do it again You changed Daniel from a captive into a kings counselor You took Peter the fisherman and made him Peter an apostle Because of you David went from leading sheep to leading armies Do it again Lord for we need counselors today Lord We need apostles We need leaders Do it again dear Lord Most of all do again what you did at Calvary What we saw here last Tuesday you saw there that Friday Innocence slaughtered Goodness murdered Mothers weeping Evil dancing Just as the smoke eclipsed our morning so the darkness fell on your Son Just as our towers were shattered the very Tower of Eternity was pierced And by dusk heavens sweetest song was silent buried behind a rock But you did not waver O Lord You did not waver After three days in a dark hole you rolled the rock and rumbled the earth and turned the darkest Friday into the brightest Sunday Do it again Lord Grant us a September Easter We thank you dear Father for these hours of unity Christians are praying with Jews Republicans are standing with Democrats Skin colors have been covered by the ash of burning buildings We thank you for these hours of unity And we thank you for these hours of prayer The Enemy sought to bring us to our knees and succeeded He had no idea however that we would kneel before you And he has no idea what you can do Let your mercy be upon our President Vice President and their families Grant to those who lead us wisdom beyond their years and experience Have mercy upon the souls who have departed and the wounded who remain Give us grace that we might forgive and faith that we might believe And look kindly upon your church For two thousand years youve used her to heal a hurting world Do it again Lord Do it again Through Christ Amen thanks bert r martin publications production manager office alpha
