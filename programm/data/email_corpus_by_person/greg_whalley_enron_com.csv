public yesterday at Chicagos LDC Forum A representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from competitors and from the audience who criticized the system as giving Enron the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over competitors Scott Coleman an official at Altra Energy Technologies said proprietary systems like EnronOnline and systems being developed

operators About of its marketing and trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system Critics charged that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of the

over its competitors With each trade Enron gains a little bit more information about its competitors positions in the market Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself said Altras Coleman But in the short term I think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply providing a service for our customers particularly a bid and ask But I dont think Enron has the ability to move markets We are just putting a bid and ask out there and if people want to buy at our prices then fine If people want to sell at our prices fine then sell it I dont think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect We are not bigger than the marketplace When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation sort of the Big Brother of the energy marketplace The historical information is not available EnronOnlines Shults admitted We just started calculating the indices and price reports We are now providing that information to the market so everyone else has that information as well He said Enron does not retain information about those who use its system Shults did however warn that the system will make the US energy market much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future With increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide commodities on EnronOnline for example market activity in Africa and the Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc Shults also predicted
