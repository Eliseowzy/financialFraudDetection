fiber build and inhouse counsel for EBS in Houston I hope it will provide you with a better idea of the current status of this project However I will need to fill in some blanks I understand that this has been a crazy week for you but I really do need to speak with you as soon as possible about this deal The commercial folks are moving forward rapidly as you can see from the correspondence and I need to ensure that the deal is ok from a regulatory perspective I will be in the office on Wednesday late morning or early afternoon if you are available to speak then or feel free to call me on my cell phone at if you are still in the office Thank you Lara Forwarded by Lara LeibmanHOUEES on PM Patterson Robert London on PM To cc Bradford Brian Enron Subject FW FW Pole attachment contract Michelle Attached is the latest draft of the pole attachment agreement which Debora Klinger at Elektro sent over yesterday It will probably not mean much to you given that it is in Portuguese Unfortunately Debora has not marked all the changes nor has she taken into account amendments suggested by local counsel Mundie e Advogados which does not help the review process I have discussed with Brian the most efficient way of finalising the contract My suggestion from a cost as well as a speed perspective is that it be handled on the ground by Eduardo Zobaran at Mundie He has reviewed and commented upon an earlier draft of the contract and is obviously better equipped than I am on the drafting front I will let him have the latest draft as well as details of the new commercial issues and ask him to liaise directly with Brian as well as keeping me in the loop I will also ask him to resolve outstanding issues directly with Debora Klinger Brian agreed that this was probably the best way to proceed As I mentioned in my voicemail message to you earlier I will put together a bullet point summary of the contract on a clause by clause basis and you will have this by Monday morning your time I will base it on the latest draft provided by Debora Klinger and it will obviously be subject to change once the final points are resolved I will also be asking Eduardo to sign off on it Regards Rob Original Message From Debora Klinger mailto Sent June To Cc Subject Re FW Pole attachment contract Rob As agreed please find attached hereto the current version of the PAC duly marked with changes not under discussion below Please notice that that we maintained the requirement for ANEELs prior approval since we are talking about an affiliated company Best Regards Dbora Rob I apologize for not getting back to you earlier Just today I had the opportunity to review the attached draft and to discuss it with Alexandre Inneco It seems that we are pretty close to come to a document acceptable for both parties Please find below our comments on the proposed changes i Clause and Paragraph As establish under item ix of article of Joint Resolution Resolution Elektro shall have the right to forbid any sublease of the infrastructure or use of same for purposes other than those provided for in the Pole Attachment Contract PAC without Elektros prior consent Such requirement is being included in all PAC drafts in order to allow Elektro to exercise the necessary control over the agents andor the use of the infrastructure mainly for security purposes Please keep in mind that Elektro may not oppose any reasonable request except for the reasons set forth in the Resolution Although we are aware that the Resolution wont apply in this case we dont see any justification that would allow us to make an exception on Enrons case Be as it may our suggestion is to have this clause redrafted and also Clause so as to establish that Enron may sublease or sell any or all fibers to third parties as long as Enrons remain liable before Elektro for all the obligations assumed under the PAC Do you think this would meet your expectations ii Paragraph of Clause As we see it this clause would allow Enron to negotiate the use of its cables among the agents We included this clause in all PAC drafts based on the principle set forth in article of the Resolution Do you think this could be construed as an abusive condition iii Sole Paragraph of Clause We deem it convenient to explain that in addition to the penalty set forth Enron shall be liable for all the costs related to the removal of the cables and equipments that may have being attached in the infrastructure during the days period iv Paragraph of Clause All PAC drafts establish that payment will be due within days counted from the presentation of relevant invoice We dont see any grounds that would justify an exception in Enrons case v Clause and Paragraphs This clause has being discussed from the very beginning and it seems that we have not being unable to reach an agreement on it as of yet Please explain the reason why you want to modify it in the proposed draft vi Paragraph of Clause We dont agree with the concept of this clause It seems to us that in such case Elektro shall have no liability on the losses suffered by Enron Thus Enron should turn to ANEEL to claim proper indemnification vii Clause We are redrafting this clause in order to add that any dispute arising from this agreement shall be solved by ICC in accordance with Enrons policy viii Clause As mentioned above we may redraft this clause so as to establish that Enron may sublease any or all fibers to third parties as long as Enrons remain liable before Elektro for all the obligations assumed under the PAC This will not apply for any transfer of the agreement in case of which Elektros prior consent will be required Ill be finishing to redraft the PAC duly incorporated with the changes above and hope to send it to you until tomorrow together with some minor changes of technical nature we had to add to the original version Please feel free to call me if you want to discuss this matter Best regards Dbora Patterson Robert London am Debora Please find attached a copy of Elektros draft pole attachment contract as amended by Eduardo Zobaran at Mundie e Advogados I also attach a copy of his memo to me which explains the changes The changes have been made on the basis that the Enron company which enters into the contract will not be the holder of an ANATEL licence and most of the suggested changes reflect the fact that the Joint Resolution will therefore not apply Very few of the comments are commercial in nature and so I hope we can finalise the agreement as soon as possible We may need some further technical review however Could you review the document and let me know whether the changes are acceptable With regard to ANEEL approval the advice we have received is that approval under the Joint Resolution is not needed since the Joint Resolution does not apply However approval under the terms of ANEELs concession will be required Once we have agreed the terms of the contract is it possible to obtain approval in advance ie before signature on the basis that the contract will be entered into on the terms submitted to ANEEL If so I suggest that we follow this approach That way we can begin the

clients apprised of whats going on h e said But we are not engaged in any business with Enron It was and remains merely exploratory Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enrons business model because of possible legal issues and the novelty of the concept But they acknowledge that eventually Enron s approach will become commonplace In theory its great but the practice is more difficult

transacted seven times the amount of bandwidth than it had in the previous quarter the unit of energy giant Enron Corp announced Tuesday The subsidiary showed a loss of million in the quarter on

much in the same manner as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago We think that date could be late or early By Ted Jackson April Excerpts Enrons vice president and broadband trader Paul Racicot says Enron alone could enter into trades this year but some analysts dont expect volumes to reach much more than that in the entire market And while liquidity on such major routes as Los AngelesNew York and New YorkMiami will improve substantially will likely be remembered as the year progress was made on issues whose resolution was critical to the longterm health of the market Probably the bestknown proposal to promote network connectivity in the context of the emerging broadband trading market is Enrons pooling points initiative Thes e pooling points or switching and interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and sellers can be established have become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans to add new points this year We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from to this ye ar says Paul Racicot vice president of bandwidth trading at Enron But well trade anywhere thou gh he added Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enrons pooling points is an effort to control the broadband market information flow Enrons goal is to promote connectivity not to use pooling points as means of gaining access to information about trading flows he says The purpose of pooling points is to improve market liquidity for broadband trading The importance of this cannot be overstated A very high degree of connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadbandtrading market to be established According to Racicot connectivity will develop rapidly this year spur red not just by Enron but also by thirdparty developers Click here to read full text By Brian Santo April Since the market is not becoming liquid quickly enough Enron is wheelin g and dealing to spark the growth of bandwidtheating applications That was a major impetus behind th e companys illfated deal with Blockbuster to provide videoondemand services and it is part o f the rationale behind a recent agreement with EBWorldcom the online subsidiary of computergame retailer Electronics Boutique Holdings EBWorldcom will soon deliver computer games ondemand from its Web site using streaming technology from Into Networks Enrons preferred vendor of streaming technology Were trying to drive growth of bandwidth to the home to increase overa ll bandwidth use says Michael Harris Enrons commercial manager of softwareondemand and video games Enrons activities put cable operators who offer broadband connectivity in the fortuitous and fortunate position of having someone else promoting a market for one of

Racicot says Enron alone could enter into trades this year but some analysts dont expect volumes to reach much more than that in the entire market And while liquidity on such major routes as Los AngelesNew York and New YorkMiami will improve substantially will likely be remembered as the year progress was made on issues whose resolution was critical to the longterm health of the market Probably the bestknown proposal to promote network connectivity in the context of the emerging broadband trading market is Enrons pooling points initiative Thes e pooling points or switching and interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and sellers can be established have become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans to add new points this year We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from to this ye ar says Paul Racicot vice president of bandwidth trading at Enron But well trade anywhere thou gh he added Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enrons pooling points is an effort to control the broadband market information flow Enrons goal is to promote connectivity not to use pooling points as means of gaining access to information about trading flows he says The purpose of pooling points is to improve market liquidity for broadband trading The importance of this cannot be overstated A very high degree of connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadbandtrading market to be established According to Racicot connectivity will develop rapidly this year spur red not just by Enron but also by thirdparty developers Click here to read full text By Brian Santo April Since the market is not becoming liquid quickly enough Enron is wheelin g and dealing to spark the growth of

Networks Enrons preferred vendor of streaming technology Were trying to drive growth of bandwidth to the home to increase overa ll bandwidth use says Michael Harris Enrons commercial manager of softwareondemand and video games Enrons activities put cable operators who offer broadband connectivity in the fortuitous and fortunate position of having someone else promoting a market for one of

Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with its plans to create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space In a recent letter to Starcoms clients CEO Renetta McCann said the Chicagobased media company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry we find Enrons plan intriguing McCann wrote Clearly Enron proposes breaking the rules of h ow media can be bought and sold Last year Enron Corp the billion financial risk management company previously associated with the energy industry created EMS to market pricerisk management pla ns to advertisers and mediaservice companies In addition Houstonbased Enron seeks to execute billion in media buys by years end though a representative declined to release information about any possible deals In this volatile economy marketers and media agencies could use Enrons ability to hedge the risk of media costs as far as five years ahead said Edward Ondarza a vp for EM S Up to this point the only way marketers could cushion risk is by buying forward via the upfront he added We want to create a yearround upfront by developing a media exchange between advertisers media agencies and networks he said Despite Enrons pitch Starcom has received little feedback to the letter from its clients said Kevin Gallagher vp and director of local investments for Starcom which claims billion in billings and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft Were always open to new ways of doing business and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of whats going on h e said But we are not engaged in any business with Enron It was and remains merely exploratory Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enrons business model because of possible legal issues and the novelty of the concept But they acknowledge that eventually Enron s approach will become commonplace In theory its great but the practice is more difficult said Jon Mandel MediaCom chief negotiating officer There are some big issues that need to be worked out Click here to see the article in Adweek Platts In the first quarter Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the amount of bandwidth than it had in the previous quarter the unit of energy giant Enron Corp announced Tuesday The subsidiary showed a loss of million in the quarter on revenues of million the results being attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed transactions in the quarter more than double the level of the previous quarter More impressive was the sevenfol d increase in transacted bandwidth this quarter Terabytes versus Terabytes in the fourth quarter Enron is making excellent progress in creating a commodity market Skilling said Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter for a total of Of that number of the customers are carriers or network service providers a spokeswoman told BMR adding that half of the deals done in the quarter were with that group Bandwidth intermediationtrading was the other key driver with transactions posted during the quarter a significant rampup from reported Q and for all of In our view we are way past the question Can bandwidth be commoditized and are enteri ng the period of rapid growth in commodity volumes which precedes the allimportant emergence of profitability In the energy commodity markets particularly natural gas and power in both the United States and Europe the commodity volume growth phase lasted years before profitability emerged We see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market which from a commodity perspective looks acts and feels like electricity and natural gas to perform any differe ntly from these commodities We are entering Year of the period of rapid volume growth The next catalyst in our view will be for Enron to announce a reasonably date certain for profitabilit y much in the same manner as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago We think that date could be late or early By Ted Jackson April Excerpts Enrons vice president and broadband trader Paul Racicot says Enron alone could enter into trades this year but some analysts dont expect volumes to reach much more than that in the entire market And while liquidity on such major routes as Los AngelesNew York and New YorkMiami will improve substantially will likely be remembered as the year progress was made on issues whose resolution was critical to the longterm health of the market Probably the bestknown proposal to promote network connectivity in the context of the emerging broadband trading market is Enrons pooling points initiative Thes e pooling points or switching and interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and sellers can be established have become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans to add new points this year We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from to this ye ar says Paul Racicot vice president of bandwidth trading at Enron But well trade anywhere thou gh he added Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enrons pooling points is an effort to control the broadband market information flow Enrons goal is to promote connectivity not to use pooling points as means of gaining access to information about trading flows he says The purpose of pooling points is to improve market liquidity for broadband trading The importance of this cannot be overstated A very high degree of connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadbandtrading market to be established According to Racicot connectivity will develop rapidly this year spur red not just by Enron but also by thirdparty developers Click here to read full text By Brian Santo April Since the market is not becoming liquid quickly enough Enron is wheelin g and dealing to spark the growth of bandwidtheating applications That was a major impetus behind th e companys illfated deal with Blockbuster to provide videoondemand services and it is part o f the rationale behind a recent agreement with EBWorldcom the online subsidiary of computergame retailer Electronics Boutique Holdings EBWorldcom will soon deliver computer games ondemand from its Web site using streaming technology from Into Networks Enrons preferred vendor of streaming technology Were trying to drive growth of bandwidth to the home to increase overa ll bandwidth use says Michael Harris Enrons commercial manager of softwareondemand and video games Enrons activities put cable operators who offer broadband connectivity in the fortuitous and fortunate position of having someone else promoting a market for one of their service s without doing anything to promote that market themselves Harris says Enron is talking with a number of broadband service provide rs under nondisclosure agreements Click here to read

streaming deal with EB By John Gaudiosi March Analysts still bullish on Enron broadband unit By C Bryson Hull Other Press Warner Home Video president Warren Lieberfarb said there is no reason not to look at the Enron service more seriously now that Blockbuster is out of the equation The reason they didnt get the movies was that there were too many participants with their finger in the distribution channel pie between the studio content provider and the consumer Lieberfarb said The license fees were unacceptable visavis other VOD delivery systems Daily Variety Industry Analysts Mary Joy Scafidi a senior analyst with IDC says it makes sense for Enron to want to have other avenues for securing content because Blockbuster most likely had access to a limited number of movie studios for online sales Even the cable companies are struggling to get the studios to buy into releasing content for these services Scafidi said Typically the studios will only release just so many of their films even for payperview Houston Chronicle and Associated Press Newswire In the currently tightening economy we do not expect things to change significantly over the near term but considering Enrons large investments in its Intelligent Network and EOD and the companys very deep pockets we dont expect it to remain lonely for long Zona Research Experts generally agreed that Enron gets the better end of the broken deal Enron will be better positioned to seek many more content providers to include in its videoondemand service offering ahead of the current fourcity trials completion said analyst Brownlee Thomas of Giga Information Group InternetWeek Click here to read more Financial Analysts Termination of agreement with Blockbuster is more bark than bite as delivery platform technically sound contentlight No change in estimates or fundamental outlook Lehman Brothers We view the termination of the EnronBlockbuster deal as a mild negative Enron will most likely be able to shop its technology around and ink another billion worth of contracts in In addition the content volumes anticipated under the year Blockbuster deal will most likely be picked up with another provider now that Enron can shop around Enron is the only player in the market optimizing its network capabilities to deliver digital content JP Morgan Securities Though this announcement is clearly a disappointment and diminishes its billion Broadband Services Content Services divisions year total contracting value TCV we have a great deal of confidence in the judgment of Enrons senior management including those leading Broadband Services and of the upside associated with this segment All things considered we believe Enron can still achieve its billion Content Services TCV goal over the next nine months Our valuation assumptions remain unchanged UBS Warburg While the separation from such a high profile name is disappointing we do not view this as negative In addition to having no impact on our EPS estimates this could in fact actually accelerate Enrons content delivery strategy Importantly Enron has proven its technical ability to deliver movies on demand Now ENE is free to pursue relationships

Data Bank By Ted Jackson March Enron Finds Retail Ally For Software Venture By Jeff Baumgartner March Rapid New Connections By Alan Stewart March FebruaryMarch Issue Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market commoditising this fastgrowing area for the first time It acted as a market maker purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks which was then sold on to Best Buy a retailer of electronics products Crucially both contracts were based on Enrons standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a selfmanage d and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network Enrons involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offerin g and imbedded optionality according to Ravi Thuraisingham a senior trader at Enron When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market t o buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later Tha t is unprecedented says Thuraisingham The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed t o firm delivery than the bandwidth market but these trades mark a significan t development Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases There is a premium in the price for firm delivery says Thuraisingham He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker In addition equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market says Thuraisingham FebruaryMarch Issue Roundtable Preview Marcello

Communications Dynegy Global Communications France Telecom and Telemonde Networks Following are his initial comments to Telecoms Capacity Marcello Romano is vice president bandwidth trading at Enron Broadband Services in London arguably one of the most important players in the commoditisation of the market The concept of firmness of delivery will encourage more participants in the long term What is important to realise is that firmness doesnt mean delivery tomorrow All it means is that if you commit to a date and then fa il to deliver on that date you must pay damages These are not punitive they are fair In the telecoms sector damages are usually payable in credits b ut its important that any damages go above what was originally paid in tha t contract Otherwise there is no contractual incentive for the carrier to deliver on time or at all The downturn in investors appetite to put money into telecoms companies will hasten a trading culture The carriers already trade capacity between themselves to allow them to sell services As investment for expansion declines these options will become more attractive But it generally still makes sense to build rather than buy where there is volume Pooling points are the logical conclusion to the problems of connectivity Metro platforms are a key feature of a number of carriers strategies be cause they help you get around a lot of local loop issues and offer increased access to buyers and sellers Carriers are currently trying to build to as many telehouses within a metro area as possible because noone wants to be tied The pooling point concept takes that to a logical conclusion It is more economical to create a hub that can then connect to all the telehouses through the networks of the carriers involved Its efficient and fairly cheap to connect The idea that people dont want to be involved with po oling points because its a link you cant control is nonsense Carriers co nnect with third parties such as CLECs all the time and rely on them to complete a route Its not a revolution its an evolution You can be a player without owning a network In Europe Enron has no fibre network and is involved in the buy and the sell side of the market That s a positive development which reinforces the model were trying to build A lot of players spend a lot of money finding and closing simple transactions We can help them do it cheaper and allow their sales force to concentrate on higher valueadded sales Whats wrong with that UPCOMING TRAINING Broadband Risk Management Advanced Course Date April days Time am pm CST

th e physical backbone and switching platform to support EBS emerging bandwidth and related trading operations Likewise EBS has developed a superior technical and commercial platform to digitally

Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with its plans to create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space In a recent letter to Starcoms clients CEO Renetta McCann said the Chicagobased media company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry we find Enrons plan intriguing McCann wrote Clearly Enron proposes breaking the rules of h ow media can be bought and sold Last year Enron Corp the billion financial risk management company previously associated with the energy industry created EMS to market pricerisk management pla ns to advertisers and mediaservice companies In addition Houstonbased Enron seeks to execute billion in media buys by years end though a representative declined to release information about any possible deals In this volatile economy marketers and media agencies could use Enrons ability to hedge the risk of media costs as far as five years ahead said Edward Ondarza a vp for EM S Up to this point the only way marketers could cushion risk is by buying forward via the upfront he added We want to create a yearround upfront by developing a media exchange between advertisers media agencies and networks he said Despite Enrons pitch Starcom has received little feedback to the letter from its clients said Kevin Gallagher vp and director of local investments for Starcom which claims billion in billings and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft Were always open to new ways of doing business and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of whats going on h e said But we are not engaged in any business with Enron It was and remains merely exploratory Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enrons business model because of possible legal issues and the novelty of the concept But they acknowledge that eventually Enron s approach will become commonplace In theory its great but the practice is more difficult said Jon Mandel MediaCom chief negotiating officer There are some big issues that need to be worked out Click here to see the article in Adweek Platts In the first quarter Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the amount of bandwidth than it had in the previous quarter the unit of energy giant Enron Corp announced Tuesday The subsidiary showed a loss of million in the quarter on revenues of million the results being attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed transactions in the quarter more than double the level of the previous quarter More impressive was the sevenfol d increase in transacted bandwidth this quarter Terabytes versus Terabytes in the fourth quarter Enron is making excellent progress in creating a commodity market Skilling said Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter for a total of Of that number of the customers are carriers or network service providers a spokeswoman told BMR adding that half of the deals done in the quarter were with that group Bandwidth intermediationtrading was the other key driver with transactions posted during the quarter a significant rampup from reported Q and for all of In our view we are way past the question Can bandwidth be commoditized and are enteri ng the period of rapid growth in commodity volumes which precedes the allimportant emergence of profitability In the energy commodity markets particularly natural gas and power in both the United States and Europe the commodity volume growth phase lasted years before profitability emerged We see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market which from a commodity perspective looks acts and feels like electricity and natural gas to perform any differe ntly from these commodities We are entering Year of the period of rapid volume growth The next catalyst in our view will be for Enron to announce a reasonably date certain for profitabilit y much in the same manner as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago We think that date could be late or early By Ted Jackson April Excerpts Enrons vice president and broadband trader Paul Racicot says Enron alone could enter into trades this year but some analysts dont expect volumes to reach much more than that in the entire market And while liquidity on such major routes as Los AngelesNew York and New YorkMiami will improve substantially will likely be remembered as the year progress was made on issues whose resolution was critical to the longterm health of the market Probably the bestknown proposal to promote network connectivity in the context of the emerging broadband trading market is Enrons pooling points initiative Thes e pooling points or switching and interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and sellers can be established have become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans to add new points this year We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from to this ye ar says Paul Racicot vice president of bandwidth trading at Enron But well trade anywhere thou gh he added Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enrons pooling points is an effort to control the broadband market information flow Enrons goal is to promote connectivity not to use pooling points as means of gaining access to information about trading flows he says The purpose of pooling points is to improve market liquidity for broadband trading The importance of this cannot be overstated A very high degree of connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadbandtrading market to be established According to Racicot connectivity will develop rapidly this year spur red not just by Enron but also by thirdparty developers Click here to read full text By Brian Santo April Since the market is not becoming liquid quickly enough Enron is wheelin g and dealing to spark the growth of bandwidtheating applications That was a major impetus behind th e companys illfated deal with Blockbuster to provide videoondemand services and it is part o f the rationale behind a recent agreement

Networks Enrons preferred vendor of streaming technology Were trying to drive growth of bandwidth to the home to increase overa ll bandwidth use says Michael Harris Enrons commercial manager of softwareondemand and video games Enrons activities put cable operators who offer broadband connectivity in the fortuitous and fortunate position of having someone else promoting a market for one of

deal with Blockbuster However the company can tak e solace in an agreement signed with Electronics Boutique to launch broadband video games News of the Blockbuster deal collapse on March unnerved investors and sen t Enrons shares plummeting from around to a monthly low of on March They had ye t to recover at press time Steve Elliott managing director of EBS Europe says the venture with Blockbuster which was only four months old failed because Blockbuster had not secured the quality and quantity of content Enron expected therefore the predicted demand had not materialised Jonathan Oxley a director at PricewaterhouseCoopers management consultancy believes that in the present economic climate services such as videoondemand are often the first to b e cancelled by consumers eager to make cuts in their household spending But Elliott is confident in the potential of broadband services The de mand is high though actual growth rates are not as high as we thought they would be The incumbents have made it difficult for DSL and regulation in Europe is particularly restricting We are looking at it in a marketbymarket situation especially in Eur ope he adds At the moment Enron is focused on the Nordic regions and France But the UK is not showin g signs of doing anything quickly so our strategies are more based around existing service offerings Oxley also believes the logistics of videoondemand are still technologically problematic Provisioning and interconnectivity are troublesome at the best of times especially with competition from digital cable and satellite he says The Electronics Boutique deal helps reassert Enrons content delivery ambitions From June EBWorldcom a subsidiary of Electronics Boutique will stream video games to broadband internet users Into Networks will supply the platform for realtime streaming to which EB S will lend its strategic and financial support Currently Into Networks platform has more than million broadband subscribers Elliot declines

Counterparties Numbers include Long Haul Local Loop IP Storage Advertising DRAM and Satellite for North America Europe and Asia April OPEN ACCESS TO POOLING POINTS EBS announced this week that it is providing open access to its global network of pooling points for buyers and sellers of bandwidth This approach enables qualified market participants to connect to Enrons pooling points and transact with all connected parties What were trying to do here at Enron is promote liquidity in the bandwidth intermediation market and a more efficient means of interconnection said Geoff Allen director of global bandwidth risk management for EBS Although the pooling points are private open access means that Enron supports the notion that counterparties have the freedom to transact through any pooling point system they choose Enron offers interconnection at its pooling points for a monthly port fee of which will be waived for transactions in which the carrier is a counterparty There will be room for different entities supporting various goals and objectives continued Allen Companies will be able to access bandwidth services from a plethora of providers creating a hub for exchanging bandwidth

deal with Blockbuster However the company can tak e solace in an agreement signed with Electronics Boutique to launch broadband video games News of the Blockbuster deal collapse on March unnerved investors and sen t Enrons shares plummeting from around to a monthly low of on March They had ye t to recover at press time Steve Elliott managing director of EBS Europe says the venture with Blockbuster which was only four months old failed because Blockbuster had not secured the quality and quantity of content Enron expected therefore the predicted demand had not materialised Jonathan Oxley a director at PricewaterhouseCoopers management consultancy believes that in the present economic climate services such as videoondemand are often the first to b e cancelled by consumers eager to make cuts in their household spending But Elliott is confident in the potential of broadband services The de mand is high though actual growth rates are not as high as we thought they would be The incumbents have made it difficult for DSL and regulation in Europe is particularly restricting We are looking at it in a marketbymarket situation especially in Eur ope he adds At the moment Enron is focused on the Nordic regions and France But the UK is not showin g signs of doing anything quickly so our strategies are more based around existing service offerings Oxley also believes the logistics of videoondemand are still technologically problematic Provisioning and interconnectivity are troublesome at the best of times especially with competition from digital cable and satellite he says The Electronics Boutique deal helps reassert Enrons content delivery ambitions From June EBWorldcom a subsidiary of Electronics Boutique will stream video games to broadband internet users Into Networks will supply the platform for realtime streaming to which EB S will lend its strategic and financial support Currently Into Networks platform has more than million broadband subscribers Elliot declines to reveal the value of the revenuesharing agreement with Electronics Boutique but says that it was not intended to fill the gap left by the Blockbuster deal Enron has created a secure endtoend

Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with its plans to create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space In a recent letter to Starcoms clients CEO Renetta McCann said the Chicagobased media company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry we find Enrons plan intriguing McCann wrote Clearly Enron proposes breaking the rules of h ow media can be bought and sold Last year Enron Corp the billion financial risk management company previously associated with the energy industry created EMS to market pricerisk management pla ns to advertisers and mediaservice companies In addition Houstonbased Enron seeks to execute billion in media buys by years end though a representative declined to release information about any possible deals In this volatile economy marketers and media agencies could use Enrons ability to hedge the risk of media costs as far as five years ahead said Edward Ondarza a vp for EM S Up to this point the only way marketers could cushion risk is by buying forward via the upfront he added We want to create a yearround upfront by developing a media exchange between advertisers media agencies and networks he said Despite Enrons pitch Starcom has received little feedback to the letter from its clients said Kevin Gallagher vp and director of local investments for Starcom which claims billion in billings and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft Were always open to new ways of doing business and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of whats going on h e said But we are not engaged in any business with Enron It was and remains merely exploratory Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enrons business model because of possible legal issues and the novelty of the concept But they acknowledge that eventually Enron s approach will become commonplace In theory its great but the practice is more difficult said Jon Mandel MediaCom chief negotiating officer There are some big issues that need to be worked out Click here to see the article in Adweek Platts In the first quarter Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the amount of bandwidth than it had in the previous quarter the unit of energy giant Enron Corp announced Tuesday The subsidiary showed a loss of million in the quarter on revenues of million the results being attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed transactions in the quarter more than double the level of the previous quarter More impressive was the sevenfol d increase in transacted bandwidth this quarter Terabytes versus Terabytes in the fourth quarter Enron is making excellent progress in creating a commodity market Skilling said Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter for a total of Of that number of the customers are carriers or network service providers a spokeswoman told BMR adding that half of the deals done in the quarter were with that group Bandwidth intermediationtrading was the other key driver with transactions posted during the quarter a significant rampup from reported Q and for all of In our view we are way past the question Can bandwidth be commoditized and are enteri ng the period of rapid growth in commodity volumes which precedes the allimportant emergence of profitability In the energy commodity markets particularly natural gas and power in both the United States and Europe the commodity volume growth phase lasted years before profitability emerged We see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market which from a commodity perspective looks acts and feels like electricity and natural gas to perform any differe ntly from these commodities We are entering Year of the period of rapid volume growth The next catalyst in our view will be for Enron to announce a reasonably date certain for profitabilit y much in the same manner as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago We think that date could be late or early By Ted Jackson April Excerpts Enrons vice president and broadband trader Paul Racicot says Enron alone could enter into trades this year but some analysts dont expect volumes to reach much more than that in the entire market And while liquidity on such major routes as Los AngelesNew York and New YorkMiami will improve substantially will likely be remembered as the year progress was made on issues whose resolution was critical to the longterm health of the market Probably the bestknown proposal to promote network connectivity in the context of the emerging broadband trading market is Enrons pooling points initiative Thes e pooling points or switching and interconnection facilities through which connections between buyers and sellers can be established have become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans to add new points this year We plan on expanding the number of pooling points from to this ye ar says Paul Racicot vice president of bandwidth trading at Enron But well trade anywhere thou gh he added Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enrons pooling points is an effort to control the broadband market information flow Enrons goal is to promote connectivity not to use pooling points as means of gaining access to information about trading flows he says The purpose of pooling points is to improve market liquidity for broadband trading The importance of this cannot be overstated A very high degree of connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadbandtrading market to be established According to Racicot connectivity will develop rapidly this year spur red not just by Enron but also by thirdparty developers Click here to read full text By Brian Santo April Since the market is not becoming liquid quickly enough Enron is wheelin g and dealing to spark the growth of bandwidtheating applications That was a major impetus behind th e companys illfated deal with Blockbuster to provide videoondemand services and it is part o f the rationale behind a recent agreement with EBWorldcom the online subsidiary of computergame retailer Electronics Boutique Holdings EBWorldcom will soon deliver computer games ondemand from its Web site using streaming technology from Into Networks Enrons preferred vendor of streaming technology Were trying to drive growth of bandwidth to the home to increase overa ll bandwidth use says Michael Harris Enrons commercial manager of softwareondemand and video games Enrons activities put cable operators who offer broadband connectivity in the fortuitous and fortunate position of having someone else promoting a market for one of their service s without doing anything to promote that market themselves Harris says Enron is talking with a number of broadband service provide rs under nondisclosure agreements Click here to read

Data Bank By Ted Jackson March Enron Finds Retail Ally For Software Venture By Jeff Baumgartner March Rapid New Connections By Alan Stewart March FebruaryMarch Issue Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market commoditising this fastgrowing area for the first time It acted as a market maker purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks which was then sold on to Best Buy a retailer of electronics products Crucially both contracts were based on Enrons standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a selfmanage d and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network Enrons involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offerin g and imbedded optionality according to Ravi Thuraisingham a senior trader at Enron When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market t o buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later Tha t is unprecedented says Thuraisingham The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed t o firm delivery than the bandwidth market but these trades mark a significan t development Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases There is a premium in the price for firm delivery says Thuraisingham He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker In addition equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market says Thuraisingham FebruaryMarch Issue Roundtable Preview Marcello Romano EBS vicepresident bandwidth trading in London is participating in a roundtable on the development of the bandwidth trading market Other participants include TFS Telecom Division Williams Communications Dynegy Global Communications France Telecom and Telemonde Networks Following are his initial comments to Telecoms Capacity Marcello Romano is vice president bandwidth trading at Enron Broadband Services in London arguably one of the most important players in the commoditisation of the market The concept of firmness of delivery will encourage more participants in the long term What is important to realise is that firmness doesnt mean delivery tomorrow All it means is that if you commit to a date and then fa il to deliver on that date you must pay damages These are not punitive they are fair In the telecoms sector damages are usually payable in credits b ut its important that any damages go above what was originally paid in tha t contract Otherwise there is no contractual incentive for the carrier to deliver on time or at all The downturn in investors appetite to put money into telecoms companies will hasten a trading culture The carriers already trade capacity between themselves to allow them to sell services As investment for expansion declines these options will become more attractive But it generally still makes sense to build rather than buy where there is volume Pooling points are the logical conclusion to the problems of connectivity Metro platforms are a key feature of a number of carriers strategies be cause they help you get around a lot of local loop issues and offer increased access to buyers and sellers Carriers are currently trying to build to as many telehouses within a metro area as possible because noone wants to be tied The pooling point concept takes that to a logical conclusion It is more economical to create a hub that can then connect to all the telehouses through the networks of the carriers involved Its efficient and fairly cheap to connect The idea that people dont want to be involved with po oling points because its a link you cant control is nonsense Carriers co nnect with third parties such as CLECs all the time and rely on them to complete a route Its not a revolution its an evolution You can be a player without owning a network In Europe Enron has no fibre network and is involved in the buy and the sell side of the market That s a positive development which reinforces the model were trying to build A lot of players spend a lot of money finding and closing simple transactions We can help them do it cheaper and allow their sales force to concentrate on higher valueadded sales Whats wrong with that UPCOMING TRAINING Broadband Risk Management Advanced Course Date April days Time am pm CST

streaming deal with EB By John Gaudiosi March Analysts still bullish on Enron broadband unit By C Bryson Hull Other Press Warner Home Video president Warren Lieberfarb said there is no reason not to look at the Enron service more seriously now that Blockbuster is out of the equation The reason they didnt get the movies was that there were too many participants with their finger in the distribution channel pie between the studio content provider and the consumer Lieberfarb said The license fees were unacceptable visavis other VOD delivery systems Daily Variety Industry Analysts Mary Joy Scafidi a senior analyst with IDC says it makes sense for Enron to want to have other avenues for securing content because Blockbuster most likely had access to a limited number of movie studios for online sales Even the cable companies are struggling to get the studios to buy into releasing content for these services Scafidi said Typically the studios will only release just so many of their films even for payperview Houston Chronicle and Associated Press Newswire In the currently tightening economy we do not expect things to change significantly over the near term but considering Enrons large investments in its Intelligent Network and EOD and the companys very deep pockets we dont expect it to remain lonely for long Zona Research Experts generally agreed that Enron gets the better end of the broken deal Enron will be better positioned to seek many more content providers to include in its videoondemand service offering ahead of the current fourcity trials completion said analyst Brownlee Thomas of Giga Information Group InternetWeek Click here to read more Financial Analysts Termination of agreement with Blockbuster is more bark than bite as delivery platform technically sound contentlight No change in estimates or fundamental outlook Lehman Brothers We view the termination of the EnronBlockbuster deal as a mild negative Enron will most likely be able to shop its technology around and ink another billion worth of contracts in In addition the content volumes anticipated under the year Blockbuster deal will most likely be picked up with another provider now that Enron can shop around Enron is the only player in the market optimizing its network capabilities to deliver digital content JP Morgan Securities Though this announcement is clearly a disappointment and diminishes its billion Broadband Services Content Services divisions year total contracting value TCV we have a great deal of confidence in the judgment of Enrons senior management including those leading Broadband Services and of the upside associated with this segment All things considered we believe Enron can still achieve its billion Content Services TCV goal over the next nine months Our valuation assumptions remain unchanged UBS Warburg While the separation from such a high profile name is disappointing we do not view this as negative In addition to having no impact on our EPS estimates this could in fact actually accelerate Enrons content delivery strategy Importantly Enron has proven its technical ability to deliver movies on demand Now ENE is free to pursue relationships
