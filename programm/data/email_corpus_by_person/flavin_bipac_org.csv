S Broder Washington Post Staff Writer Monday August Page A LOS ANGELES Now that the hoopla of the Democratic National Convention is past its time for Michael Whouley and his team to go to work Whouley is the Gore campaign consultant supervising the Democratic Partys ground warthe man in charge of identifying voters who are likely to support the vice president and other Democratic candidates and getting them to the polls on Election Day With Democrats hoping forand anticipatinga close battle for the White House and both houses of Congress the margin of victory could they believe turn on the turnout operations run by the coordinated campaign teams Whouley and his partners have been recruiting in the last few weeks As if there were not enough motivation in arming for battle at every level from the legislatures up the Republicans have raised the stakes by announcing two weeks ago that they will funnel most of a million Victory Fund through their national and state parties into a similar operation targeted on ticketsplitters and weak partisans Democratic officials are not certain how seriously to take the threat and are skeptical Republicans can match them in manpowereven if they spend much more on the ground war than they have in the past But as Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Since we dont know what the test will be we are presuming it will be the toughest The job of getting people to the polls is harder than ever for both parties because of the shortage of highintensity issues in a time of general prosperity and the growing public cynicism about politics and elections But Republicans have an easier task For months more than percent of their selfidentified partisans have been telling pollsters they support Texas Gov George W Bush With those base voters highly motivated by the prospect of recapturing the White House Republicans plan to pour their resources into swing suburban areas find out which ticketsplitters are leaning to Bush and deluge them with mail and phone calls supporting the entire Republican ticket The counterpart Democratic effort or coordinated campaign will according to Andrew and Whouley focus more on turning out the urban base of the party with a secondary push in selected ticketsplitting suburbs in districts and states where key House and Senate races are likely to be decided Democrats have more experience than Republicans in running these turnout efforts for their whole ticket They have been using this model since when the late Paul Tully working at the DNC convinced statewide candidates and the unions supporting them in several key states that rather than working individually they should pool funds and hire staff to register and mobilize voters for all their races The Democrats have been expanding and improving their operation in every cycle since then and turnout programs employing targeted mailings phone calls and literature distribution as well as soft moneyfinanced issue ads all aimed at African American voters are credited with powering upset victories especially in gubernatorial races in Alabama Georgia and South Carolina But this year they face special challenges in the black and Latino constituencies and there is some nervousness about the pace of preparations for the battle ahead New Jersey Sen Robert G Torricelli chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said The coordinated campaign is late starting this year In we did a good ad program for our base during the summer and I havent seen anything like it so far Others including some labor officials who have been critical in the past of the youth and inexperience of the coordinated campaign directors dispatched from Washington to the states say that this year the DNC has a seasoned corps of people heading the field operations The three top DNC staffers for the coordinated campaigns Laurie Moskowitz John Giesser and Fred Humphreys all were working states in when Tully began setting up the model Andrew began prodding states to develop their game plans for this fall as soon as he became party chairman in March having been convinced of the value of direct voter contact during his previous job as Indiana Democratic chairman With Democrats and Republicans tied in the Indiana state House going into the election Andrew targeted districts for intensive voter contact work and won of them giving the Democrats control With that experience as his talking point Andrew has persuaded all state parties to submit their own coordinated campaign plans and budgets At the end of last week states had their coordinators chosenif not always in place Democrats declined to disclose their budget but Andrew said they will be outspent at least to if Republicans actually put million into Victory as they have advertised But Andrews figure does not include what labor unions supporting Gore and other Democrats spend from their own treasuries mobilizing members and their families And it is that union effort which Republicans say is their biggest worry After spending millions on issue ads in the campaign AFLCIO President John Sweeney decided to switch those resources to a voter contact program with dramatic results The union household share of the actual electorate rose from percent in to percent in according to exit polls Surveys taken for the AFLCIO found that percent of the workers who remembered receiving a flyer from their union supported the endorsed candidates those who had a conversation about the election with a union volunteer at the workplace or on the doorstep were percent in support of the union choices With control of the House as important a target as Gores victory the AFLCIO has mobilized local coordinators in targeted congressional districts Unions that are part of the labor federation now are dispatching staff members to coordinate the coordinators Sweeney for one argues that without the machinery and the people we can deploy the Republicans talk of a million ground campaign is really just a public relations ploy That may or may not prove to be true Meanwhile there were some complaints at the convention from African American and Latino elected officials and organizers about the planningor lack of planningfor turnout programs in their communities One key California labor official for example charged that a halfmilliondollar program targeted on Latino voters had been canceled after Tony Coelho a former California congressman left his post as chairman of the Gore campaign Despite the static Democrats are
