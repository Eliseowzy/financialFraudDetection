for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this letter and to consider Merchant Capital Inc as your Commodities Brokerage firm Sincerely Robert Wilson Sr Broker Remember at Merchant Capital Inc we work for you Dear Trader Have you ever wondered whats the difference between a successful commodities trader and a nonsuccessful trader The answer is not that difficult its knowledge Knowledge can be obtained several different ways One way is the school of hard knocks which many people have honorary degrees but no moneyIve been there in case you are wondering Another way a better way is to find someone who knows how to trade and have that person teach you This is certainly a better and less costly choice My name is David Duty and I started trading over five years ago after I got a brochure in the mail about trading commodities It seemed interesting and I got pretty excited about the possibilities I ordered a course that promised everything but delivered almost nothing I lost in less than days not to mention the I threw away on these courses I quickly found out that I did not know what I was doing Then I got mad not at the man who sold me the almost worthless courses but at myself for jumping into something without knowing what I was doing I ask myself Whats The Difference between someone who trades and consistently makes money and what I was doing I found the answer pretty simple Like I said its knowledge So I took a year off and studied and read everything I could lay my hands on During this time I found a lot of good material and some that was so bad that the person who wrote them should have been shot I started compiling information that I deemed to be reliable that had substance to it What I found was a common thread among them I started formulating a trading plan and put that plan into action This time it was completely different I was trading and making money and was only spending about an hour a day at it and some days as little as minutes I then had friends and relatives who saw what I was doing and they too wanted to learn how to trade So I started teaching some of them how to trade Then people they knew wanted to learn also so I
