Project Inservice dates were Bloomfield LaPlata A and Gallup Sempra protest delayed the issuance of certificate until HP was added at the Gallup Compressor Station coolers and not compression were constructed at Bloomfield and LaPlata which reduced the temperature of the gas flowing in the San Juan Lateral This reduction in temperature caused the lateral and associated down field compressors to operate more efficiently creating an incremental Mcf per day of firm capacity on the Blanco to Thoreau segment of the San Juan Lateral The project enabled Transwestern to maintain its mainline operating pressure from Thoreau west to California at psig at all times thereby accommodating shifts in market demand to the east without restricting delivery capacity to California As a result TW is able to once again operate its mainline west of Thoreau at its certificated capacity of Total final costs filed with FERC were million As stated in the original application the project was funded with internally generated funds Please talk to Drew regarding the rates The shipper data is correct All the contract terms are for five years with the exception of El Paso Energy at years and North Star Steel which expires on March As the Commission observed in the January Order ECS is not a jurisdictional company whereas the motor that they would own is a jurisdictional facility Transwestern was therefore instructed to restructure its relationship with ECS so that Transwestern would have sufficient control over the motor to assume regulatory responsibility for the motors operation

point had a delay Id like to know if and when it went into service if it was built under blanket authority or was it certificated if it indeed runs miles from Iowa to Illinois and if so what is the diameter how much did it cost million if it has a postage stamp rate and if so what is it who are the shippers and with whom does it compete If thats the case please provide the docket number For the other Transwestern Gallup Id like to know if it went into service Feb as planned how much compression was added at the Bloomfield and LaPlata A stations or anywhere else for this project if it added Mcfday bringing the mainline to Bcfday if it cost million as projected and if internal funds were used and what are the rates which FERC ordered the company to disclose We had the shippers listed as follows Duke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC Mcfday El Paso Energy Marketing Co Mcfday Southern Energy Inc Mcfday Sempra Energy Trading Mcfday Reliant Energy Services Inc Mcfday and North Star Steel
