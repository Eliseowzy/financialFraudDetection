<23304385.1075852908361.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gary.choquette@enron.com,2001-10-04 13:42:23,RE FW Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points Cc According to the copy of the contract I have under Exhibit A The Rebate A portion of CDECs demand charge associated with CDECs generation fixed costs shall be avoidable by ECS if Customer operates the Compressor such that ECS is able to avoid placing a load on CDECs system d uring certain CDEC coincidental peaks for any applicable month To calcula te the monthly rebate the actual demand charges as billed by CDEC will be subtracted from the Billing Demand Basis The Billing Demand Basis is the maximum demand charge on MW of peak demand assuming no peak avoidance d uring the applicable month Thus the Customers Rebate shall be a portion of the Billing Demand Basis that ECS is not billed by CDEC as actual deman d charges The way I interpret this wording we would be entitled to a demand charge r ebate even if we only slow down the unit during the peak period Ive only a copy of last Augusts bill but we used MW during TriStates CDEC s generation peak At kW generation demand this would entitle TW to a rebate of for the month of August alone To me it is unclear if TW is actually receiving this rebate Ive got Mark Walton looking int o the issue Note that there is an additional transmission demand of kW that is coincident with CDECs peak Currently we have no method o f predicting CDECs peak Apparently for the month of August CDECs and T riStates peaks did not occur at the same time although there is no speci fic information on the CDEC bill as to when their demand peak occurred as the TriState peak and CDEC peak demand charges are based on different load s Interpretation of the contract language would lead one to believe the r ebate would only apply to the demand associated generation and thus be val ued at kW Even so if we avoided CDECs peak it would be a saving to ECS and thus to Enron I understood from James Centilli that the econom ics were based on avoiding the peak demand of the time at kW or kW I dont know David you are correct we only have to avoid one peak in the month the pr oblem is predicting which peak is going to be the largest peak in the month You dont know for sure on the first day of the month if the load on tha t day will be higher than the load on the last of the month Below is a li st TriStates historical peaks in MW For January the peak was on the rd in it was on the The pr oblem is you dont know for certain which day of the month will have the pe ak The contract did not specify they would only have one peak that they w ere going to interrupt us on only that if we avoided their peak whenever it occurred we would save in demand charges Using the most conservative approach to avoid a demand peak you would not run at all on the first day of a month the first day is always a peak day in the month to date You would only run during the second day when the sy stem load is less than the peak we saw on the first day If the system loa d on the second day is higher than that of the first day this now becomes the new peak of the month to date You would repeat this approach for each subsequent day in the month shutting down or slowing down for each new pe ak in the month to date The approach I take is a little riskier in that it looks at last years load and budget loads to estimate a minimum expected monthly peak It than allows operation of the unit anytime the system load is less than the high er of the actual monthly peak to date and the minimum expected mon thly peak Thus my utility would let you run for the majority and possib ility all of the first day and would have fewer peaks during the month tha n the conservative approach You are correct about ECSs obligation in establishing an automated system That system has turned into my system Sections and Article of the contract discuss this topic In my mind ECS did not live up to their end of this agreement CDEC didnt do much either only providing us access t o TriStates web site TriState changed their web site mid year requiring a change in the automated process due to file format changes delaying my implementation I offered to take over the automated system sometime arou nd the end of the first quarter this year to force some progress on the iss ue There may me legal recourse available to recover some past demand char ges due TW from ECS By my calculationcontract interpretation the maximum rebate TW could rece ive is kW kWMonth MonthsYear D year Original Message From Roensch David SentThursday October AM ToChoquette Gary Schoolcraft Darrell Jolly Rich CcAsante Ben McChane Bob Sturn John Watson Kimberly SubjectRE FW Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points Gary you are correct in your assesment that we can avoid electrical power d emand charges if we shut down during power utilities pear power period Ho wever in discussions prior to finalizing this contract I got the impressi on that a decision had been made that we MUST shut the unit down during pea k demand periods or the econimics of the project did not come out these discussions included Mike Nelson Rich Jolly Mary Kay Miller Dave Fotti Ben Asante D Schoolcraft James Centelli Kevin Hyatt etc Second The issue came up of What about during tariff months can we st ill shut down during peak demand periods Again if I remember correctly the answer was Yes even during tariff months we dont have a choice we wo uld have to shut down Third I was under the impression that from a risk standpoint we would not have to deal with more than ONE peak demand period in the month Fourth ECS was responsible for working with the CDEC to establish an auto mated system which would read CDECs online load profile and convert the re ading into a signal which would automatically control the loading on the Co mpressor and Motor which would provide us with the opportunity to avoid th e CDECs peak load periods TW of course would have an override option However I was also under the impression that ECS would hold TW harmless reimburse if this feature was not provided I may be interpreting this incorrectly but again the CSA specifies ECSs ob ligation in helping us avoid the demand energy charge The demand charge i s KW Months D of potential rebate back t o TW each year File

Points As I understandinterpret the Gallup contract we can completely avoid elec trical power demand charges approximately per month if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period If we can not s hut down the unit we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our po wer usage during the peak period Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specifi ed period of the day PM Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day Through access to Tri States history data I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the mon th will be I can look at the current days usage and estimate if todays peak will be higher than the higher of my estimated peak or the act ual peak so far this month If so the Probability today is a peak will be near indicating the operators they should expect a possible power pe ak sometime today The Probability now is peak approached when an a ctual peak is underway The TriState Power Peak In Progress alarm trigger s when a power peak is underway Note that it is impossible to predict with accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak If the first day of the month has an estima ted peak and last years peak for the same month was It appears possible that this will be a power peak day Assume that the actual peak u sage for the first day was Now on the second day of the month the e stimated peak is not likely to be a power peak day The third day has an estimated peak of a possible power peak day If the actual for t he third day is it now becomes the new peak for the month If all ot her estimated peaks in the month are significantly below they are not likely to be power peaks and unit turndown is not required The point is to completely avoid demand charges we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month and also on the third day The utility integrates their peak over a minute period thus the minimum time the unit could be down Im guessing that my utility cou ld predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month So far this month I guessed a power peak on starting at and ending at The actual peak so far this month according to the utilit y was starting at lasting to Im sorry for any confusion I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators If there are any additional questions do not hesitate t o call me at
