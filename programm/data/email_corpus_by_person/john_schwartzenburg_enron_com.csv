Comments Mark The attached email raises the following three questions with respect to Enrons endorsement and adoption of the attached statement of principles on Security and Human Rights and my response is noted after each question Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its endorsement of these polices No If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy Given the limited physical presence of EGM in foreign locations I would not expect implementation to be a problem Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy The commitment under the Consultation and Advice section of the statement on Interactions between Companies and Public Security provides In their consultations with host governments Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote adherence to international law enforcement standards particularly those reflected in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms I believe we should take note that all appropriate measures is very broad and could publicly be construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular country that fails to abide by these principles My response pertains only to the operations of Enron Global Markets I will be checking my emails while I am in Singapore and will be happy to address this

representatives of industry including Enron and NGOs including Amesty and Human Rights Watch under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and Foreign Secretary Cook As a result we really dont

drop by and brief me on these Cognizant Govt Never heard of the term and itis not one of the usual defined terms Dont know how its used here suggest you decline andmake them clarify LOL ISSUES I suppose that this is a NY law contract I do not think you can effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in NY Regardless of choice of law we generally cannot get this limited or excluded in contracts with owners either I think you should not accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or otherwise and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any to the fullest extent permitted by law clause or other such stuff as a compromise It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment Generally I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity for Haz Mat patents etc They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity for all third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past I would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger Enron is working it Please try it again if you can Scott

Indemnity issues They should indemnify us from claims by their employeessubcontractors Kay Is your comment in connection with GEs comment to Section iii carve out of the LOL for gross acts of its subcontractors vendors ect GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and vendors I think Section a as written covers simple negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section iii as written dealing with gross negligence of GEs subcontractors and vendors Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence Agree Maybe we could agree to GEs strike out in a provided the phrase negligent or willfully wrongful is replaced with negligent at fault or strictly liable without fault or some variation thereof What is a cognizant government Dont know This was not discussed with MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term We need to also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails to comply with law and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty is ordered to shut down the facility Limit of liability issues They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws patent infringement liability for haz waste and liens to of purchase price They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence if possible Agree See st comment above re indemnity They dont want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another partys claim for consequentials as in a personal
