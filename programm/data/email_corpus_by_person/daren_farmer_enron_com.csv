Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave feel free to chime

group It gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back Impact to Logistics Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets which are not in production yetEDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month cant remember the rules on this one but I think Unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force repathing Unify does have the ability to override duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response What are if any impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods repathing I have a call into Diane and Dave both

Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with confirmed volumes Toms words of caution If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however I did add a warning message Warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback I assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems preUNIFY Some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal Before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline Sorry I dont know which pipes these are you will have to ask the UNIFY team There is one rule still in place you can change from ENAIM East to ENAIM Market East but not from ENAIM Texas to HPLCIM HPLC when changing business units they must be the same legal entity Warning not the same legal entity Also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals Transport Capacity Storage Cash Out Once the deal is invalidated there are no rules Dont forget the items were locked down for a reason If you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in UNIFY it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted Always check with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these

PipelineSouth Texas L P with a Synergi contract number and a Global number of by Karen Lambert Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT In when Copano began allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri Karen and yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS Karen sent me an email indicating that she setup a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase Global I dont have a Synergi contract number I know that in Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter I have not allocated any line gain in and the volumes are small Karen is the most knowledgeable about this contract so I suggest that any questions be directed to her regarding contract issues Karen worked with Bernard Widacki at Copano to set up the contract originally Thanks Fred

downstream processes I hope the following will give more clarification Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail Thanks dg Sitara Unify Process Scenario Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave feel free to chime

cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets which are not in production yetEDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month cant remember the rules on this one but I think Unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force repathing Unify does have the ability to override duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for EDI the scheduler would

downstream processes I hope the following will give more clarification Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail Thanks dg Sitara Unify Process Scenario Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave feel free to chime

number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to
