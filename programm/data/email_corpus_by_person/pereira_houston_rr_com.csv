emailed with him he said he was going to take some time off once he was done at EnergyUSA As for working estate team I dont think I could go back now Who knows what horrible things I might say to Scott Neal He lied to me and was so incredibly spineless when he told me I wasnt part of the team back in December that I dont think I could stomach interacting with him on any level Youre on a different floor from them right You probably still see some of the UBS people though How is Judy I havent heard from her in a long time I emailed her a funny joke a while back but never heard anything
