our ability to deliver on winter gas I would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks POWER POINTS Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on Enron Corp ENE needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game This is the home run Enron must come up with Full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet and proof the corporation can cover the difference Its what stockholders bondholders and trading partners have been demanding but time is running out and Enron hasnt produced Were going to get to that number soon and tell people We have to do that said a source at Enron who didnt know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited In this environment we are going to be absolutely sure that its accurate Enron has about billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and in a worse case scenario will face a billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets Enron has said The company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock shares will be trading closer to than their current Investors however arent acting as if theyre reassured Part of the trouble analysts with creditrating firm Standard Poors said Friday morning is that until Enron sells the assets nobody knows for sure what theyre worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole SP is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company Credit Derivative Fizzle To see the pickle the worlds premier energy franchise is in one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely but the desk hasnt been able to transact for three weeks since the value of Enrons stock and bonds began to plummet according to another Enron employee Enron didnt respond to a request for comment but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are constrained as the market continues to evaluate the companys credit position Until recently customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp XRX or Lucent Technologies LU for example might pay Enron million a year for a payout of say million in the event of a bankruptcy But you wouldnt pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims Likewise with Enrons creditworthiness in doubt theres no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk The same holds true though less obviously for Enrons core business of energy trading Some utilities large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices already on the rise at per million British thermal units shoot to this winter as they did last winter To guard against that risk companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices If a company wants to lock in winter gas at should it turn to Enron If gas were to rise to in January and Enron couldnt deliver Enrons counterparty paid a good price for no protection And if Enron failed in a gas market that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies Gas could go to in a heartbeat Leading Role An Asset Enron does have a man on base The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog Enrons trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point They are continuing to trade with Enron but are avoiding longterm deals that increase their exposure to the company The only acceptable longterm deals are those that offset deals done earlier Unless and until a bill goes unpaid theyll keep delivering Enron like the rest of the US energy industry paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enrons creditworthiness faces another test In exchange for taking on that small risk they keep the great market maker in business Lenders Show Concerns Lenders whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans dont have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time usually years Outside of longterm commitments what worries the banks which presumably got a good look at Enrons books If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with longterm energy deals that have kept it profitable for years can it service all of its liabilities known and unknown If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants or otherwise put those assets at risk will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs What happens if its greatest asset its traders leave in droves to work elsewhere If Enron is to have a chance it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt So far this year trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for billion out of billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes By comparison Enron has made million in interest payments so far this year JP Morgan Chase Co JPM and Citigroup Inc C unit Salomon Smith Barney at least dont show much confidence Enron can do it When they agreed to provide Enron with a billion line of credit they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral Bond traders the most sophisticated investors in the world make their money by understanding the probabilities Theyre trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies The lenders have chalked up their runs Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure Enron now must step up to the plate By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires

WesnerSoong Sarah SentWednesday October AM ToQuigley Dutch SubjectReduction of trading lines by Fimat Dutch there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run Johns book an d may see something in this situation I do not I wondered if you could giv e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner Thanks Sarah On Tuesday Oct Warren Tashnek Fimat Houston and Steve Forman Fimat NY telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from million to million for Enron This cut is irrespective of the mil lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line Soc Gen is th e bank that owns Fimat brokerage Fimat made this decision based on the f ollowing events according to Steve Thursday ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat The positions came from exi sting positions at ABN JP Morgan SSB and Goldman Sachs Generally broker s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as sociated with the moving of the trades Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat In this case Fimat agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook them at the trade price There was a million variation margin associat ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send on Friday to Fimat Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade price Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the million on Friday If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for million in variation margin on Thursday night Friday On Friday Fimat did not receive its million from ABN as agreed When Fimat called ABN ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to send the money directly to ENE This left Fimat exposed for million on behalf of Enron On Friday morning Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed million by Fimat Fimat sent million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G en margin line for Enron This left million available for ENE but Fima t wanted its million This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat On Friday there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal F imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE The numbe r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer e undisclosed Very late on Friday HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r ight now Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron Fimat is uncomfortable with these events Monday Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron Fimat wants to reassess the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer red to them and also the positions transferred Fimat informed Enron that it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone Fimat would n ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later in the day This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by am as to what cash transfers will occur Under our current loan agre ement with Soc Gen Fimat informs Soc Gen by noon if money should mov e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di scomfort with ENE as a counter party Tuesday positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN Fimat proposed solutions million Tbill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE although ENE has alrea dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen ts on ENEs behalf My tkae on the situation Fimat is upset based mainly on Enrons handling of expitted trades and bad press I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m argin lines to ENE I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was responsible for Fimats inconveniences I explained that Enron is prepar ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak e payments to Fimat on our behalf That issue should have been resolved wh en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi ne so far As far as the confusion with ABN we were not party to the disc ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that Fin ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no tice time I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on an on going basis This may have been necessary for them earlier this week but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea rly in the morning like all the other brokers We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now I am not inclined t o entirely blow them off especially sinces I do not want them to tell othe r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ t now At the

continue to business with the company Credit Derivative Fizzle To see the pickle the worlds premier energy franchise is in one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely but the desk hasnt been able to transact for three weeks since the value of Enrons stock and bonds began to plummet according to another Enron employee Enron didnt respond to a request for comment but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are constrained as the market continues to evaluate the companys credit position Until recently customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp XRX or Lucent Technologies LU for example might pay Enron million a year for a payout of say million in the event of a bankruptcy But you wouldnt pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims Likewise with Enrons creditworthiness in doubt theres no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk The same holds true though less obviously for Enrons core business of energy trading Some utilities large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices already on the rise at per million British thermal units shoot to this winter as they did last winter To guard against that risk companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices If a company wants to lock in winter gas at should it turn to Enron If gas were to rise to in January and Enron couldnt deliver Enrons counterparty paid a good price for no protection And if Enron failed in a gas market that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies Gas could go to in a heartbeat Leading Role An Asset Enron does have a man on base The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog Enrons trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point They are continuing to trade with Enron but are avoiding longterm deals that increase their exposure to the company The only acceptable longterm deals are those that offset deals done earlier Unless and until a bill goes unpaid theyll keep delivering Enron like the rest of the US energy industry paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enrons creditworthiness faces another test In exchange for taking on that small risk they keep the great market maker in business Lenders Show Concerns Lenders whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans dont have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time usually years Outside of longterm commitments what worries the banks which presumably got a good look at Enrons books If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with longterm energy deals that have kept it profitable for years can it service all of its liabilities known and unknown If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants or otherwise put those assets at risk will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs What happens if its greatest asset its traders leave in droves to work elsewhere If Enron is to have a chance it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt So far this year trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for billion out of billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes By comparison Enron has made million in interest payments so far this year JP Morgan Chase Co JPM and Citigroup Inc C unit Salomon Smith Barney at least dont show much confidence Enron can do it When they agreed to provide Enron with a billion line of credit they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral Bond traders the most sophisticated investors in the world make their money by understanding the probabilities Theyre trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies The lenders have chalked up their runs Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure Enron now must step up to the plate By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires

me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from million to million for Enron This cut is irrespective of the mil lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line Soc Gen is th e bank that owns Fimat brokerage Fimat made this decision based on the f ollowing events according to Steve Thursday ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat The positions came from exi sting positions at ABN JP Morgan SSB and Goldman Sachs Generally broker s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as sociated with the moving of the trades Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat In this case Fimat agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook them at the trade price There was a million variation margin associat ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send on Friday to Fimat Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade price Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the million on Friday If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for million in variation margin on Thursday night Friday On Friday Fimat did not receive its million from ABN as agreed When Fimat called ABN ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to send the money directly to ENE This left Fimat exposed for million on behalf of Enron On Friday morning Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed million by Fimat Fimat sent million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G en margin line for Enron This left million available for ENE but Fima t wanted its million This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat On Friday there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat

events Monday Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron Fimat wants to reassess the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer red to them and also the positions transferred Fimat informed Enron that it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone Fimat would n ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later in the day This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by am as to what cash transfers will occur Under our current loan agre ement with Soc Gen Fimat informs Soc Gen by noon if money should mov

ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen ts on ENEs behalf My tkae on the situation Fimat is upset based mainly on Enrons handling of expitted trades and bad press I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m argin lines to ENE I promised to look into our handling or

never have to pay them off Now shareholders could be on the hook for a billion tab Janice Revell Fortune Magazine Time Inc Copyright It was an irresistible proposition Borrow billions of dollars pay no inte rest reap millions in tax breaks and then wait for the debt to simply dis appear That was the promise of zerocoupon convertible bonds and companie s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money But of course there was a catch For this scenario to play out a company s stock price had to rise sharplyand quickly Thats because investors b ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equityif the stock ta nked the bonds would no longer be worth converting So to make them more a ttractive to buyers companies had to build in an escape hatch If the stoc k price failed to rise sufficiently investors could put that is sell the bonds back to the companyin many cases after just one year And thats exactly whats about to happento the tune of some billion over the next three years Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas t half of these special hybrids the prospect of conversion is now absurd It simply wont happen So bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can And because of the put feature that is possible Suddenly companies like Tyco Comcast and dozens more are on the hook fo r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought theyd never have t o pay That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies After all theyre the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders Companies without enough cash and the majority fall into th is campare likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew That means sharply reduced earnings Especially at risk are inv estors in companies with poor credit ratingsprime candidates for killer r efinancing costs Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o ff the debt creating significant shareholder dilution especially at curre nt depressed prices To make matters worse this is happening at a time whe n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin king This is a ticking time bomb warns Margaret Patel manager of the P ioneer High Yield Bond fund a topperforming junk fund The seeds of this mess were sown in mid when the stock market started to falter Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling Zerocoupon convertible bo nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didnt have to ma ke cash interest payments on the bonds hence the name zero Instead iss uers offered an upfront discountfor instance investors would buy a bond for and collect when it matured Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n umber of common shares But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantlyin many cases b y more than With that protective feature called the conversion premiu m zeros took off Corporate issuers would pay no interest and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels the debt would be swep t away into equity If the bonds are converted its a home run for everyb ody says Jonathan Cohen vice president of convertiblebond analysis at D eutsche Bank That fourbagger of course depends entirely on the stock price rising If it doesnt the bondholders armed with that handy put feature can simply sell the bonds back to the company Great for bondholders but not so hot for the company or its shareholders But hey what are the odds of that ha ppening CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u p says Cohen They dont worry about the bond getting put If all this seems a little complicated thats because it is A reallife e xample should help Californiabased electric utility Calpine issued bil lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt At the time the company s stock was trading at about a shareseverely undervalued in the opin ion of company management We really didnt want to sell equity at that po int says Bob Kelly Calpines senior vice president of finance So the co mpany instead opted to sell zeros setting the conversion premium at a heft y Still with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile the bonds werent exactly a scre aming buy for investors So Calpine added the put feature Investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric e eliminating any downside risk Things havent exactly worked out as management had hoped The stock has si nce plummeted to and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens e So its looking as though Calpine will be liable for the billion in b orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April Th eres also the refinancing cost According to Kelly Calpines borrowing ra te could run in the neighborhood of an extra million per year in cash Obviously nobody plans for their stock to go down Kelly says I dont think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put Calpines potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i s straddling junk If you are a borderline investmentgrade company a fin ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world notes Anand Iyer head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta nley The problem is there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r atings out there Jeff Seidel Credit Suisse First Bostons head of convert iblebond research estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category And others are at risk of having their ratings dow ngraded before the put date Today with junk yielding as much as per centage points above bonds rated investment grade refinancing can be a pri cey proposition Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk It has million in zeros that it will probably have to b uy back this January and another billion coming down the pike over th e next couple of years Because of slower thanexpected sales the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies And if Solectrons credit is downgraded the zeros would slide into junk status a situation that could cost the companyand its shareholderstens of mill ions of dollars in refinancing charges Refinancing isnt the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros Comp anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bondsup to of th e amount raised If the debt is sold back many will have spent millions fo r what essentially amounted to a oneyear loan Theyre getting bad advice claims one banker who didnt want to be named Look at the fee the bank er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into As if those potential consequences were not scary enough shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued Thats because some a re bought by hedge funds which short the companys stock sell borrowed sh ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price at the same t ime that they buy the bonds If the stock goes down the shorts make money from their position If it goes up they profit by converting the bond to s tock This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet at l east for a while Grocery chain Supervalu for example recently lost o f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing million in zeros Despite all the pitfalls the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu es thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro vide In fact the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing Even better thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code companies c an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than theyre act ually paying All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail Verizon Communications for instance would pay annual interest on its billion in zero bonds if its stock pri ce falls below of the issues conversion price In the eyes of the IRS oddly that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction for tax purposes of the same rate it pays on its regular debt Wh y Trust us you dont want to know That adds up to an annual deduction o f more than million even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere st Not surprisingly more than half of the zeros issued in contain si milar clauses Its an incredible deal for them says Vadim Iosilevich w ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management Not only are they raising cheap money theyre also doing tax arbitrage So despite the enormous risks to shareholders companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip According to ConvertBondcom seven new issues tot aling billion have been sold since Oct alone I think the power o f the tax advantage is going to keep them around says CSFBs Seidel Call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quicklyit doesnt really matter Either way its the shareholders wholl be left pay ing the bill FEEDBACK The bill comes due Companies issued convertible zeros with put features when the stock marke t soured Now repayment looms Amount issued in billions Amount puttable in billions SOURCE CONVERTBONDCOM When zero is a negative number The danger posed by convertible zero bonds depends on a number of factors according to Morgan Stanleys ConvertBondcom the size of the bond the pu t date the companys credit rating and cash on hand and how far the stock
