turned out not to be needed A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov Gray Davis energy policies are needlessly costing consumers This whole thing is a mess said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine who requested details of the states surplus power sales The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more money A state spokesman didnt dispute the million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less Its a number Im sure he likes very much but its definitely an

PM you wrote FYI Thought folks might be interested in the following story In addition Ive attached at the end for those that are interested a CSFB report on PGEs POR announced yesterday Very much enjoyed working with this group on a solution for California Perhaps given were things stand well have another shot at helping get the market California energy policy and Edison back on their feet Best Jeff FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO Updated Friday September PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resources which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midJanuary and several generators all of which were to attend the meeting Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine months are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and procedures ISO Procedures Need Explaining FERC The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market Wolfmans office said As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the second letter says The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays meeting Generators Confused Generators including Mirant Corp MIR investmentsquotessymbolMIR news investmentsnewssymbolMIR msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolMIR Reliant Energy Inc REI

investmentsdiscusssymbolDYN have bought apparently inexpensive power in the ISOs spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher Thats because according to the allegations the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as outofmarket purchases that arent averaged into the realtime prices that ISO market participants see DWR continues to buy outofmarket power regularly at the ISOs request DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs longterm contracts The outofmarket purchases appear to be expensive however According to the ISOs August market report the average outofmarket price for peak hours was a megawatthour compared with MWh on the ISO computerized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the outofmarket prices for months None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Calif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meeting isnt open to the public The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices Wolfman said in the letter By Jason Leopold Dow

yesterday Very much enjoyed working with this group on a solution for California Perhaps given were things stand well have another shot at helping get the market California energy policy and Edison back on their feet Best Jeff FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO Updated Friday September PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resources which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midJanuary and several generators all of which were to attend the meeting Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine months are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and procedures ISO Procedures Need Explaining FERC The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market Wolfmans office said As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the second letter says The ISO has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Mondays meeting Generators Confused Generators including Mirant Corp MIR investmentsquotessymbolMIR news investmentsnewssymbolMIR msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolMIR Reliant Energy

according to the allegations the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as outofmarket purchases that arent averaged into the realtime prices that ISO market participants see DWR continues to buy outofmarket power regularly at the ISOs request DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs longterm contracts The outofmarket purchases appear to be expensive however According to the ISOs August market report the average outofmarket price for peak hours was a megawatthour compared with MWh on the ISO computerized market Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the outofmarket prices for months None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISOs headquarters in Folsom Calif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend FERC will serve as facilitator Wolfman said The meeting isnt open to the public The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices Wolfman said in

heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb Best Jeff Mike Florio urn To org cc Subject Re Figures show state lost big on extra power PM Shame on you Jeff I expect this sort of thing from inexperienced reporters and dim bulbs like Campbell But you KNOW that this sort of thing is no big deal And when did the PUC ever disallow these kinds of losses for the utilities I dont think my memory has gotten that bad MIKE At PM you wrote FYI Many similar stories in the major papers today Best Jeff Figures show state lost big on extra power Posted at pm PDT Monday July BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News State figures show California may have lost about million this month selling surplus electricity for less than it cost The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be needed A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov Gray Davis energy policies are needlessly costing consumers This whole thing is a mess said Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine who requested details of the states surplus power sales The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more money A state spokesman didnt dispute the million figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably is less Its a number Im sure he likes very much but its definitely an estimated number and it could be far lower said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher The state has spent million on power so far this month State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left California holding more power than it needs The revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power expecting shortages this summer Price that was paid The state bought million megawatthours of electricity for July at an average price of per megawatthour according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resources to Campbells inquiry The state has sold surplus megawatthours in July at an average price of the department said Based on those average prices the state paid million for the surplus power which it sold for million million less than it cost A more precise calculation of the states loss is difficult because purchased power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a portfolio Purchases included longterm contracts that averaged per megawatthour as well as cheaper spotmarket buys State officials last week said they were selling surplus at to a megawatthour while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just percent of Californias July purchases which totaled million The million from sales will help lower the states power bill he said adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity Despite the fact that were in somewhat of a surplus any powerbuying operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations Hidalgo said Its not unique and in fact its normal operating procedure for any utility Other Western utilities including Portland General Electric in Oregon have said they too are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a cost of doing business The suppliers buying the states surplus electricity on the cheap include the big outofstate energy companies that the governor has called pricegouging snakes Among them are Duke Energy Dynegy Power and Marketing El Paso Power Services Mirant Reliant Energy and Williams Energy Best bid taken Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find Its only reasonable to get the best bid you can he said Campbell said the million loss is troubling because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost whereas a private utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable State officials say whats more important is that the overall cost of power is dropping from an average daily tab of million in May to million this month in part because the state has so much power
