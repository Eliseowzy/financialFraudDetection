March AM To Jim Dyer Subject RE Real Options Course Feedback Jim Your student has raised some difficult questions I would recommend Ehud but I thought that the finance people have the answers in cases

March PM To Jim Dyer Subject RE Real Options Course Feedback Jim I teach at the same time as you do Sheridan Sheridan Titman Department of Finance College of Business Administration University of Texas Austin Texas phone fax Original Message From Jim Dyer Sent Thursday March AM To Sheridan Titman Subject FW Real Options Course Feedback Sheridan See the comments below I dont mean to put you on the spot and have not announced anything in class but I am hoping that you could visit my class for about an hour one Thursday afternoon to discuss your views regarding applications of option pricing concepts to real options As a reminder Ive attached a course outline Chris Kenyon from Schlumberger is speaking on April and Vince Kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on April I am going to be out of town on April so that leaves either next Thursday April or May Would either of those times work for you Im not thinking of any preparation but more of an informal discussion of the philosophical issues related to real options work Jim Original Message From Jim Dyer Sent Thursday March PM To Subject RE Real Options Course Feedback Josh Some very thoughtful observations As you know I had invited one finance professor to our class on Arundel but he was out of town I do plan to invite Sheridan Titman to discuss the issue of using the option models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded I do think it is important to face that issue which is actually covered at a theoretical level in our last couple of readings The issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further discussion as you suggest So far weve been looking at cases where volatility is given The problem of finding an objective measure of volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct risk adjusted discount rate which is not surprising since the concepts are almost two sides of the same plate One approach of course is to do some modeling using traditional decision analysis tools including subjective probabilities but the finance people who write options articles dont like to think about such ideas Ill try to address these issues in more detail as the semester continues I think it was important to surface some of these points early and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a naive sort of way Thanks for the feedback and comments Jim Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March AM To Cc Subject Real Options Course Feedback After overcoming the initial I hope overload of materials and tools presented thus far in the semester it appears to me that you are achieving the objective of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety of problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded financial elements As a constructive feedback you have been forthright with us in marking off areas of this subject which are still controversial I also realize that rightly so realworld application of this type of analysis without a robust understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions that result in a house of cards effect My opinion at this point is that two issues are of potentially makeorbrake importance if I am to persuade my superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of projects whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by financial instruments These issues are easy to guess Discounting and Risk Free rates I do not sense that anyone in the class has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time value questions in the absence of liquidity Is there someone within the finance department that can present a firmer position on this question Volatility I found Winstons examples on this metric succinct I would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject My criticism again relates to messy problems I anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures If I were a conservative financial manager I would argue that Twoa implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized Oil gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company Twob based on the following skepticism if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture some new unexploited opportunity there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure This skepticism is likely to be less acute in hightech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by NASDQ touts It is a much harder sell to mature industries Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed A large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis As an intentionally screwedup example can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for US companies investing in seed

detail as the semester continues I think it was important to surface some of these points early and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a naive sort of way Thanks for the feedback and comments Jim Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March AM To Cc Subject Real Options Course Feedback After overcoming the initial I hope overload of materials and tools presented thus far in the semester it appears to me that you are achieving the objective of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety of problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded financial elements As a constructive feedback you have been forthright with us in marking off areas of this subject which are still controversial I also realize that rightly so realworld application of this type of analysis without a robust understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions that result in a house of cards effect My opinion at this point is that two issues are of potentially makeorbrake importance if I am to persuade my superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of projects whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by financial instruments These issues are easy to guess Discounting and Risk Free rates I do not sense that anyone in the class has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time value questions in the absence of liquidity Is there someone within the finance department that can present a firmer position on this question Volatility I found Winstons examples on this metric succinct I would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject My criticism again relates to messy problems I anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures If I were a conservative financial manager I would argue that Twoa implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized Oil gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company Twob based on the following skepticism if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture some new unexploited opportunity there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure This skepticism is likely to be less acute in hightech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by NASDQ touts It is a much harder sell to mature industries Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed A large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis As an intentionally screwedup example can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for US companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based on speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility CFE and PEMEX James S Dyer Fondren Centennial Chair in Business Department of Management Science and
