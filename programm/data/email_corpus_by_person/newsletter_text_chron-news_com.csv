Lots of Sports Too Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom How to Send Us Community Notices How to Contact Us Letter from the Editor Time for a quick review as we start another online year around here One of the obvious advantages of the Web is its immediacy Thats something we try to utilize every day as we start updating the HoustonChroniclecom Web site especially the home page just about the time the printed newspaper is landing on front lawns all over the city This becomes especially valuable when major news developments are occurring halfway around the world in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East where the sun is revealing a new day just about the time those of us in Houston are going to sleep and the overnight press runs are beginning for the newspaper The newspaper will contain full accounts of developments from the previous day and then we can update those articles as the next days events begin unfolding Immediacy also is valuable closer to home where new developments in ongoing stories like the Enron coverage or jury selection in the Andrea Yates murder trial come throughout the day The Chronicle is keeping track of these for you and we use the Web site to provide the information even before writing the articles which will appear in the next mornings newspaper But it doesnt have to be a big story News really never stops happening in a city the size of Houston so we keep bringing new stories to you throughout the day We do take a short break from about am to a little before am most days but somebody is minding the store for you pretty much round the clock outside of those hours weekends and holidays included Perhaps less obvious another advantage of the Web is its longevity The Chronicle brought you some outstanding reporting this past year from our reporters covering Central and South America And if you missed the special sections in the newspaper on the demise of the rain forest or Colombias FARC rebel movement slip over to the World news section of the Web site and they still are there so you wont overlook them just because you missed seeing the paper the day they ran Ongoing stories like the Yates murder case the Enron bankruptcy Tropical storm Allison even the Sept terrorist attacks on America we can provide not only the latest developments on the Web site but all of the coverage from the very beginning of the story Or even older stories lake the dragging death of James Byrd Jr in Jasper a few years back or the AM Bonfire collapse and its aftermath You just cannot get a more complete view of these stories than is available from the Web site So please dont use the Web site just for a quick update of whats happening Spend a little time delving into the backgrounds of the major stories of the day too After all we are working to provide as complete a picture as we can for you Thanks for visiting and please take advantage of all we offer Mike Read Editor HoustonChroniclecom News Lots of Sports Too News comes in several flavors One of the most popular turns out to be sports where the games of our youth turn into big business and entertainment as we become adults And we around here put a lot of effort into keeping you as up to date as we can in this flavor of news too The Rockets and Aeros are in the middle of their seasons Baseballs spring training season is less than a month away Professional footballs Super Bowl XXXVI is two weeks away and Houstons Texans are preparing for their first season this fall Were not going to be ignoring any of this but a lot of our attention these days is being devoted to turning from last weeks Houston Marathon to next months Olympic Games in Salt Lake City and of course Houstons ongoing bid to host the summer games here in But we cant ignore that most Texan of sports either as the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is just around the corner Even if your taste in entertainment turns more toward TV and movies we think youll be missing an important part of the news if you dont at least take a brief tour through the Sports pages of the site from time to time You can start that tour at sports Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom Traffic It probably comes as no surprise to any of our Houston area readers that the citys traffic is a mess From the traditional congestion of the soon to be widened forever Katy Freeway to the forever under construction highways all around the city traffic is a daily challenge for many of us Main Street is of course a mess because of rail construction It seems the entire downtown area is a giant detaour whether from the construction on the east side the Cotswald Project on the north or just general surprise projects on any street at any moment The Southwest Freeway is a special challenge these days still under construction through the Museum District torn all to pieces out near the Fort Bend county line and now with multiple lanes blocked at its busiest point where it crosses under the Loop interchange near the Galleria HOV lanes Metros Park Ride van pooling nothing really solves the challenge but we are trying to provide some tools to make it easier Weve got construction updates published in the newspaper and on the Web site every business day Maps of the various transit possibilities and links to realtime traffic conditions on all the major freeways Along with maps and directions if you just need a little help figuring out where you are and where you need to be Follow all of the construction at traffic Archives Access for NonSubscribers For a couple of year now the online archives of the

Political Recommendations Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom How to Send Us Community Notices How to Contact Us Letter from the Editor From time to time one of these newsletters elicits enough email responses that it appears a few folks actually read them Thats really gratifying But humbling too since some of those responses tend to indicate that we who work with this site every day may be assuming that our customers are more familiar with where we put things than actually is the case We mentioned last week that we can create special Web sections for ongoing stories and keep special sections from the newspaper around on the Web site for a long time after the paper itself may have been misplaced Several folks asked where to find these items on the Web site so we may not have them as obviously available as we thought There is in the leftside navigation bar on all of the News sections of the site including the home page a navigation segment that includes a variety of special resources including breaking news from the Associated Press streaming audio news reports strange and bizarre news stories and a section labeled News Specials Its that News Specials section where we keep all of the various special sections we make available on the Web site You can short cut directly to it at specialreports or you can just use the navigation link to open it up The major ongoing special sections right now involve Enron developments the Andrea Pia Yates trial and the countrys continuing responses to the terrorist attacks of Sept The page also includes stories still coming from the June flooding brought on by Tropical Storm Allison Special sections from the various areas of the newspaper news features sports are maintained online in this area as long as they remain of interest While some stories from this part of the site perhaps the war in Kosovo begin to fade after a time and drop off the Special Reports page others like the dragging death of James Byrd Jr likely will remain for years to come We even include some special Webumentary pieces that we have created for the Web site in cooperation with the staff of the newspaper These are articles where we get to work with the writers and photographers as the story is being developed so that we can add interactive multimedia coverage to extend the story beyond the limits available in print A couple of examples from the current Special Reports area would be pieces called Where Ghosts Dwell and So you wanna be a rock roll star As new stories come along they will be added Next up likely will be the Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City taking a spot on the page alongside the coverage already there of the Summer Games in Australia Not all ongoing stories will end up in this section Some will show up on the Web site only while they are going on and then will fade away but the Special Reports page is a good place to check for stories that you think might qualify for special extended coverage Thanks for visiting and please let us be your first source for information Mike Read Editor HoustonChroniclecom News Political Recommendations It does seem that the election process never ends any more Only a few weeks ago we were going to the polls to cast votes in the runoff contests to finish settling the campaigns But here we are again in the thick of political posturing as candidates line up for the primary contests to decide candidates for this years November elections for officials all the way to the US Senate As always the Chronicles Editorial Board meets with all of the candidates trying to get a handle on which are the best of the lot and then shares this experience with you in the form of recommendations in the various races This is not a Voters Guide which we also will provide closer to the election and which will provide more complete information on all of the candidates More like the arts and movie critics of the paper offering their opinions in the form of reviews the newspapers political recommendations need to be coupled with your own views as you form your own opinions But whether you consider these recommendations as wise suggestions or an indication of who you definitely dont want to vote for we offer them for your consideration from time to time on the Editorial page of the paper And assembled into a complete collection available from either the Editorial or Politics pages on the Web site Check the candidates out at recommendations Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom ThisWeek In addition to covering major news events throughout the metropolitan Houston area every day the Chronicle produces different neighborhood community sections that are included in the paper each week Well actually each of the ThisWeek publications normally fills a couple of broadsheet sections to be included in the paper each Thursday The community publications are produced by a division of the news department and include lots of neighborhood news that might not be of widespread interest to other neighborhoods but can be of great interest to the local community We here on the Web site dont want you to miss this more personal version of the news either so we post articles from all ThisWeek publications on the site each Thursday and maintain the pages throughout the week until the next pulication date rolls around On the home page youll find a link for ThisWeek in that same leftside navigation segment with the News Specials and the AP breaking news links Its a little redundant but we thought it might be helpful so we included links to the ThisWeek section of the site in the navigation bar for folks opening the links to Community resources and the Metro State news section as well Follow all of the really local news at thisweek Archives Access for

Legacy of Love and Pain Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom How to Send Us Community Notices How to Contact Us Letter from the Editor We would like to think that all of our online readers visit HoustonChroniclecom every day Rain or shine Weekends and holidays too But we know that isnt the case And we field a number of emails over the course of every week asking how to find articles that no longer are visible on the daily Web pages The Web site much like the paper is a daily product Each day we present the current events of that day And the next day the events of that day The daily links normally are functional for a couple of weeks but they are visible on the site for only one day So the challenge is how to find yesterdays links tomorrow if you fail to visit the Web site every single day Obviously we have at least something of a solution or we wouldnt be mentioning the problem The best solution would be a search routine that just hunted through all of the functional links on the site Its a long involved tale why we dont have something like this on the site but we dont although we do have it on our list of ongoing projects In the absence of a search routine we suggest subscribing to the daily HTML email versions of the major news sections of the site page one local and state business andor sports Overnight each day we email out special HTML versions of these four Web pages complete with links to all of the stories appearing on the Web site as the day begins If you have an email account that can handle HTML email basic AOL cannot you can get several advantages over browseronly customers For starters you get a daily update in your email each morning to let you know what the major news of the day is You can read over story summaries without having to open your browser But if you do want to know more about an article just click on it like it was a Web link and most mail clients will launch your browser for you and open the complete article If you miss visiting the Web site for a few days the emails will be waiting with the links no longer visible of the Web site itself And if you keep the emails for a few days you have your own shortterm archive of Web links to find articles from the past couple of weeks A few folks who do not have HTML capabilities in their normal email accounts have set up accounts on free Webbased email services like hotmailcom or eudoramailcom just to receive these emails each day We have links atop each of the Web pages available by email where you can sign up to have them delivered or you can sort through all of our email offerings at mailmanagehtml Thanks for visiting and please let us keep you informed of the news of the day Mike Read Editor HoustonChroniclecom News Legacy of Love and Pain And in case you didnt visit the Web site yesterday you missed a very special though painful story that we think you probably wouldnt want to miss Almost a year ago Angela Hudson was tied up doused with gasoline and set on fire in her own home That she survived at all was little short of a miracle delivered through the quick bravery of two men who broke in past her assailant and extiguished the flames Still she suffered horrendous burns over much of her upper body and face and her survival was questionable for weeks after the attack Out of this horrific incident three generations of women in her family have had their lives changed forever Statistic show that every seconds somewhere in America a woman is beaten by a husband or boyfriend and that every day four of them die But statistics do not show the mental and physical terrors of such abuse Chronicle reporter Daniel J Vargas and photographer Andrew Innerarity have followed the familys struggles since the attack Their story adds a human dimension to the statistics and its at legacy Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom Time to Vote Doesnt it seem like we just finished an election It was after all December when we finally determined who was going to be Houstons mayor for the next couple of years Well folks its time to vote again party primaries to select candidates for this years November general elections The official date of the

the year comes to a close Parties and social affairs come to the fore and business begins to become less important in our lives well just a little less important anyway And we here at HoustonChroniclecom hope that all of you who read this newsletter enjoy this traditional approach to the end of the year this year especially But for us its going to be a little busier than usual and we just wanted to give you a little advance notice that we are working as hard as we can to provide some rather major changes to the site by the start of the new year Some of the sources we use for some major parts of the site are not going to be available after the end of the year and we are trying to make their loss as inconspicuous as we can The Web site always has been somewhat under construction but the pace is going to be a little heavier than normal between now and the end of the year Weve already made some of the changes in the new Arts and Entertainment area and more will be coming in the weeks ahead And we know that despite our best efforts some of you will find some of your favorite pieces of the site will change Rest assured we are trying to make things better not just different But do contact us if one of the changes really affects something important to you We need to know and we will try our best to come up with solutions as quickly as possible to minimize the upset Thanks for visiting and please try not to run into any construction barricades Mike Read Editor HoustonChroniclecom News Goodfellows The ThanksgivingYule holiday season is one when traditionally we devote some of our thoughts and efforts to those less fortunate than ourselves This year especially there are plenty of folks less fortunate than us to be thinking about Each year the Chronicle sponsors a communitywide effort to brighten the season for families throughout the area as part of our Goodfellows program Its a project for all of us here with a lot of help from our readers and our friends Weve set up an online site where you can join in and contribute to the effort Or let us know of a family that needs help Or just find out more about the program Or as the season continues learn more about the problems some of our neighbors face in their lives This is a different kind of interactivity from what we generally think of on a Web site But it spreads our reach and you might brighten your own season while helping to brighten that of someone else Help us help this holiday at goodfellows Whats New at HoustonChroniclecom Runoff Elections One more week of campaigning before
