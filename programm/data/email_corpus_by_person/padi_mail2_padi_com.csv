experiences We received more than emails and more than were sent directly to me I did my best to answer everyone that requested a response I am still working on a few late arrivals Many of you indicated that the newsletter was very America centered Guilty as charged Despite my best efforts I get most of my information from the dive press and our own sources I did suggest to a few readers that they become my correspondent in their perspective area I offer that opportunity to all of you now Please feel free to send me a brief note about what is going on in your part of the world that might interest other PADI Divers When appropriate and possible I will work it into the Fellow Diver Newsletter Maybe I can even get it on the website so include pictures when possible With that said here is some more news from America my good friend Pat Hammer and PADI Star IDC owner in Chicago asked me to mention the Our World Underwater consumer diver in the Chicago area on April th So if you

center Theyll be able to help PADI Star IDC and CDC Centers along with Gold Palm IDC Resorts specialize in fulfilling dreams of careers in diving Many of you asked about specific information about

tell you the truth I havent gotten the opportunity to dive everywhere I would like to and certainly not in as many locations as you asked about However I did give some great advice about diving in Lake Mead Nevada So this is how you find out about those great dive locations Go to padicom and look up the destination in the dive center and resort locator Our network of dive centers and resorts would love to hear from you and answer your questions Your local dive center is also an excellent source of information If youre still stumped contact PADI Travel Network and they can get you answers

experiences We received more than emails and more than were sent directly to me I did my best to answer everyone that requested a response I am still working on a few late arrivals Many of you indicated that the newsletter was very America centered Guilty as charged Despite my best efforts I get most of my information from the dive press and our own sources I did suggest to a few readers that they become my correspondent in their perspective area I offer that opportunity to all of you now Please feel free to send me a brief note about what is going on in your part of the world that might interest other PADI Divers When appropriate and possible I will work it into the Fellow Diver Newsletter Maybe I can even get it on the website so include pictures when possible With that said here is some more news from America my good friend Pat Hammer and PADI Star IDC owner in Chicago asked me to mention the Our World Underwater consumer diver in the Chicago area on April th So if you are going to be any where near the windy city go to the show If you ever thought of visiting Chicago this is the best reason in the world to book your trip now Ok I got carried away By the way if you

become a PADI Dive Master and Instructor what kind of jobs are available what kind of money can be made and all that good stuff that you want to know Until then speak will your instructor or PADI dive center Theyll be able to help PADI Star IDC and CDC Centers along with Gold Palm IDC Resorts specialize in fulfilling dreams of careers in diving Many of you asked about specific information about dive destinations The most common question went something like this I have been thinking about going to XYZ Dive Destination can you tell me how the diving is and wheres a good place to stay Well to tell you the truth I havent gotten the opportunity to dive everywhere I would like to and certainly not in as many locations as you asked about However I did give some great advice about diving in Lake Mead Nevada So this is how you find out about those great dive locations Go to padicom and look up the destination in the dive center and resort locator Our network of dive centers and resorts would love to hear from you and answer your questions Your local dive center is also an excellent source of information If youre still stumped contact PADI Travel Network and they can get you answers
