controversy D Brazili an judge will probably accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with Article IIIIII of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge foreign arbitration although parties have deliberately chosen foreign arbitration Jos Margalith Assessoria Jurdica Fone n Fax n email am For what it is worth I agree with Samis concern that we may laboring under a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in a Brazilian contract between Brazilian contracting parties relating to a Brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a Brazilian court Inevitably we have to fight hard for these concessions in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration not to mention blood and sweat on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts If we are really being taken by these crafty Brazilian lawyers like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I think we should rethink the policy in this specific instance Elektro because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts we had a number of cases you will recall when we bought it and have had others since It is clearly not the only substantial highprofile Brazilian company Enron has down here making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as foreigners the way we do elsewhere By all means we should check with Jose Emilio but if he shares Samis and I have to say my concerns I think we should consider making a special rule for BraziltoBrazil contracting transactions Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo in English with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts federal if possible of Sao Paulo The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision thinking we are safe and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice due process etc If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions let me know Randy Sami Arap AM To Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Randy NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Elektros telecom project Thanks again Bob I will call Jos Emilio to check I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil whether international or local aspects are under discussion provided that you follow the exequatur procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago However the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with Article IIIIII of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code In such event if Enron please note that I am always only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in So Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and at the same time or at a later stage one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void I will be in Houston on Friday January and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls andor Jim Derrick Regards Sami Robert C NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Sami NRON cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT ENRON Randy Young Rob Walls Subject Re Elektros telecom project Document link Sami Arap Sami I agree on the issue of Brazilian law But on the question of foreign arbitration our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec As to local arbitration we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than We should probably also have a cumulative cap of say million On bigger deals Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more is at stake is to agree to ICCadministered arbitration in Sao Paulo In this case I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award whether that be ad hoc ICC FIESP or CanadianBrazilian C of C Jose Emilio would have a view on this too Hope this is helpful Bob Sami NRON PM To Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re Elektros telecom project Document link Robert C Williams Embedded image moved Embedded image moved to file picpcx to file picpcx Michelle and Bob Thanks for the reply The issue here is when Brazilian entities only are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy and please correct me if I am wrong is that when Enron as a foreign company is dealing with foreign governments governmental agencies or governmentowned companies or private companies from the host company we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law In case of Elektro as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity EAS ECE etc entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil the contracting parties must comply with local public policy I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism we are all aware of Enrons policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in So Paulo To me the question is whether we use ad hoc arbitration OR institutional arbitration ie submit the matter to FIESP or the CanadianBrazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the arbitration administrator FYI since I joined Enron Ive been told that all of Enrons Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts dispute resolution mechanism In my opinion this concept may not work the way Enron wants If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and suppose both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY it is most likely that in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case You may ask why The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction Id very much like to emphasize that while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that at the end of the day I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts Since Odebrechts counterparties did not do their homework properly Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of The Civil Code of ractified the use of arbitration however it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts Only in with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act Law it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts With respect to enforceability please note that the arbitral award is final binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an exequatur Please feel
