last week he is the director of technic al operations and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a be ready instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy He is John Adams boss so there is a disconnect between the two levels In addition to Kent I spok e to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment or lack th ereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlem ent statement and use that process Going forward however that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in

Forwarded as discussed Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO which effectively requires a

currently negligible and recovery of actual costs u nder Protocols Sec may take a long time and the OOME compensa tion has various problems as well the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME the the

Protocols Section and we would appreciate any reg group efforts toward preparation for iinit iating such dispute Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom orrow even if ERCOT tells us

risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr

however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney

not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr oducts that it is generating capacity available but not energy delivered t o the grid I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC The Operating Gui des definition of OOMC page seems to recognize this however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney

CM Zone model for use in commercial congestion management for Effective date is January The three CSCs are GrahamParker kV DCKT SandowTemple kV DCKT and STPDOW kV DCKT The four CM Zones are West North South and Houston A po wer point presentation along with a map is available at CSCDATAcschtm Current Congestion Cost and Outlook The congestion charges that have been incurred are million or million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it i s MM based upon the ERCOT protocols The actual cost to redispatch and clear congestion as of Sept was MM Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the MM trigger was hit August ERCOT has month by Protoc ol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestio n rather a direct assignment of the charge The charge may be partially of fset by the TCR that will be auctioned The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge I am chairing the congestion management work ing group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit I will attach a copy of the current draft of the TCR white paper In short the TCR is a financia l option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion There is no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR There will be an auction on or about the th of February and the full zonal implementation will tak e place February The tentative schedule is as follows Distribute draft TCR White Paper Review and edit draft TCR White Paper Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS WMS Meeting vote on PRR TAC Meeting Board Meeting ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Con gestion Costs Capacity Auction The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round There was an initial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and ho w the standard was oneway and the buyers of capacity were left without rec ourse There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professional s to discuss the issues I did not participate and there will be an addit ional meeting on the th The purpose of the shortterm meeting are to re ctify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July auctions Substantive issues such as the actual products zone determinati on and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the Septem ber auction which includes annual products Protocol Implementation ERCOT is in the process of determining what shoul d be included in the Phase II design which will begin January There is a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to deter mine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items A SAP Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the PUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II Issues that do not require major system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is sta rted immediately There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs and loads acting as resources Mechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services The PUCT ha s expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the ancillary services market if it is assumed that the various ancillary ser vices have different levels of value to the market The Board had approve d a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets how ever the plan has not been implemented The WMS discussed at length the issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets nonspinning regulati on and responsive reserve A task force was formed to initially identify the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of a ncillary services issue It was suggested that a consultant be hired to de velop Protocol language once the principles are identified The first task force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled DemandSide Task Force Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load BUL Market Issues an d other demandside issues The PUCT expects the full functionality to be in place on January The DSTF met last on October st third meeti ng The DSTF completed a draft status report on DemandSide Resources and Demand Responsiveness It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not comp lete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board Howeve r ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in the demand side of ERCOTs market reviews the PUCTs directive reviews t he role of demandside resources in ERCOTs markets and identifies the iss ues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing It also summari zes the options discussed by the DSTF to date The PUCT staff has suggeste d that ERCOT hire a consultant such as Eric Hirsch to provide more resour ces for this effort The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address d irect load control issues at its next meeting Unit Specific Deployments At the next WMS meeting October there will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will di scuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the ramp rates of the deployments The WMS will develop a list of issues and case studies for ERCOT to discuss The WMS also briefly discussed PRR related to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation

NewsWatch Latest headlines SAN DIEGO CBSMW The federal government will provide grants and loans to help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills President Clinton said Wednesday Clinton said million will be earmarked to help lowincome families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled He urged the Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are struggling to pay power bills He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Well do what we can to help you the president said during a televised news conference at the White House in Washington Test case yields public outcry The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation The region which also encompasses South Orange County north of San Diego is the first in the nation to have its power market completely deregulated New York New England and midAtlantic states are following suit and theyre watching California carefully Thus far the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles Electricity supply that hasnt increased in years failed this summer to meet strong demand resulting from a growing state With market forces in play for the first time strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was passed along to residents After a public outcry the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday approved a plan that would cap customers electric bills for normal use but theyll pay market rates for anything extra Utility companies also can collect on any shortfalls later Today on CBS MarketWatch Nasdaq inches higher Dow lags Oil inventories at year low Commentary Garzarelli sees stock rally in fourth quarter Amazoncom enters car market California is electric industry test case More top stories CBS MarketWatch Columns Updated PMET In other words if the electric company cant pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now theyll be able to pass it along months later Therefore people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the cooler months in fall and winter wont see much of a dropoff Its a shameful paynoworpaylater plan said Bob Finkelstein staff attorney for the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group California jumped off the deregulation cliff State legislators which have the power to expand on the commissions ruling shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid levels and cap them for customers of San Diego Gas Electric a Sempra Energy SRE news msgs subsidiary They faced opposition from Gov Gray Davis a Democrat and from Republican lawmakers Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by percent immediately but that would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers money to help pay electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits San Diego fiasco The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated electricity market that began two years ago The effects of deregulation are being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its rate freeze last summer The rest of California should follow region after region by The idea sounded good Deregulate the electric industry and let the market set the prices With competition rates should come down and service should improve When the longdistance phone market was deregulated it did bring about low prices and greater competition But things got messed up along the way For one the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among longdistance carriers was dashed at least for now Initially hundreds of companies had signed up to offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market Of the remaining companies most serve the more lucrative corporate market said Linda Sherry a spokeswoman at Consumer Action Also the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives and negotiate better rates didnt pan out Sherry said Demand far outstrips supply Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew But supply didnt grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for years Last year the state approved five applications to build new plants but theyre years away from becoming operational Under the deregulated market electric utility companies were mandated to sell their power generation plants By separating the provider of electricity and the generator of electricity the idea is to usher in a more competitive market Today San Diego Gas Electric buys from electric generators through an auction market But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San Diego worse According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices they are required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid But in a situation where the electric company needs all the power available it has to accept all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal inflating the cost Electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more Sherry said FERC is investigating and plans to issue a report later this year But for now price caps have been set Utility company buffeted Ed Van Herik a Sempra spokesman said the auction rules are putting the squeeze on utility companies already buffeted from all sides by public outcry and political pressure But Utility Reform Networks Finkelstein said San Diego Gas Electric isnt totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high costs They

is a brief summary of many of the points that directly affect the ERCOT market I will provide a complete summary and timeline for response or request for rehearing on any of the issues later this week Two of the most noticeable departures from the Protocols was for the Commission to ask for a review of the balanced schedule requirement and a departure from the current bilateral market to an LMP type market The Commission directed ERCOT to respond with the technical feasibility of relaxing or eliminating the balanced schedule requirement The other departure from the ERCOT protocols by the Commission is in reference to loc al or intrazonal congestion The Commission states that if direct assignment of the local congestion to the generating resources is not possible they will consider other market options such as an LMP model The Commission will review both of these market concepts in September The ERCOT Protocol Review Subcommittee will take the ordered protocols and start the process of Protocol Revision Each of the revisions have been assigned a completion date by the PUCT and can be found in schedule attached The PUCT approved the ERCOT petition and Ordered the that the Protocols should take effect June The Commission state that the Protocols a re fundamentally sound however there are certain provisions that are boxed cannot take effect until the ERCOT system can accommodate them as provide d for in the Protocol Implementation Plan ERCOT was directed to initiate a process to implement the boxed provisions as soon as possible As for the rest of the changed required by the PUCT a timeline was attached for the implementation of the protocol revisions Under the Protocols as filed ERCOT had sole discretion for its con duct however the PUCT will require ERCOT to exercise its discretion in a reasonable nondiscriminatory manner Ancillary Services The Protocols require ERCOT to procure the following Ancillary Services sequentially through an Auction regulation down regulation up responsive reserves and nonspinning reserves The PUCT is concerned that the process results in the possibility of price reversals where the clearing price for some AS may be higher than other higher grade AS services which may create incentives to game the system The PUCT directed ERCOT to amend the Protocols such that it will procure AS through use of simultaneous optimization for assignment of resources to AS product s and will set prices for each AS to the corresponding shadow price The PU CT also ordered to ERCOT to amend the protocols such that it will use a two settlement system for the procurement of AS The day ahead period procurement will settle and announce at with the second to take place during the adjustment period for each hour Until the system is capable of the twosettlement system ERCOT must amend the system to only allow downwa rd adjustment of prices for unselected AS bids and allow unselected bids by a QSE to be withdrawn only in descending order of bid prices The wrinkle he re is that the ERCOT system purges unselected bids and will require a manual tracking of the bids A spot check for the activity has been discu ssed Finally ERCOT is to consider and report whether or not ERCOT should make conditional selections of AS bids from a QSE portfolio and then possible deselect based on location and not price after the QSE resource plans are published Market Solution Under the ERCOT protocols a Market Solution for reducing congestion exists when at least three unaffiliated resources have available capacity and the ability to submit a bid to ERCOT to solve a circumstance o f local congestion and no one bidder is essential to solve the congestion T he PUCT would like the protocol amended to require that a market solution exists only when at least three bids are received from unaffiliated resourc es Out of Merit Order OOM Service The PUCT directs ERCOT to use the same ratcheting sown mechanism for out of merit order capacity payments to out o f merit order energy payments that are based on the heat rates Reliability MustRun Service The PUCT would like to have additional incentives for generation entities to enter into RMR service contracts and that once covered the until will be efficiently utilized As such ERCOT is to amen the Protocols to give an RMR unit owner the additional option for retaining of net positive margins for energy generated in excess of the amount that the unit is obligated to produce under its RMR contract Uninstructed Deviations In order to encourage good price chasing and discourage bad price chasing ERCOT was ordered to amend the Protoc ols to apply the ex ante MCPE for balancing energy set ten minutes for the beginni ng of a settlement interval to all instructed deployment of balancing energy during the settlement interval and use the second subsequent interval ex poste MCPE which will be set five minutes after the end of the first settlement interval for uninstructed deviations during the first load interval Bid Caps During the transition period until July there shall b e a generation resource bid cap of per MWh for energy that ERCOT procures The bid

requirement analysis and retail load profiles ERCOT begins to manage and publish participant information and process customer service requests June ERCOT initiates switch processing from competitive retailers starting with small volumes and to be completed by July this is only the switch request power does not flow from the REP until the billing cycle after July ERCOT begins to process retail

controlling frequency The existing control area replaced with the single control area run by ERCOT Wholesale Markets ERCOT administers the regulation balancing energy and reserve markets ERCOT starts clearing prices as part of single control ar ea operations The wholesale competitive market as defined by the protocols is initiated with ERCOT settling AS markets centrally ERCOT begins to execute financial transfer processes as a result of binding settlement with participants QSEs must have completed qualification activities While the proposal satisfies many of the competing concerns of the Stakeholders and the PUCT there are a few outstanding issues that remain ERCOT will begin switching load transfer requests on June but actua l settlement and energy flow will not occur until after the wholesale market opens on July Enron has submitted a proposal that would allow the retail market to decouple from the wholesale market which would allow the wholesale market time to remedy the system limitations and the retail marke t could begin June Under the ERCOT timeline if the wholesale market is not ready by July and the switch requests have already begun th en there is no method to serve a customer full requirements without the abilit y of the REP to purchase balancing energy and other AS other than purchasing under current tariff I can provide a copy of the Enron proposal to those who are interested Another concern is for reliability of the system Some parties question th e wisdom of opening the wholesale market in the middle of the summer peak rather than waiting until the summer peak has passed Credit Standards The Board also voted on language for the surety bonds There has been a debate as to whether ERCOT should allow security bonds in light of what has happened in California and the surety bond that was underwritten by AIG At this point the PUCT order requires ERCOT to accep t a surety bond however ERCOT is trying to tighten the payment language T he language that the board approved will be forwarded when I get the correct language The board approved the addition of BBB credit to the credit lim it matrix New Power Company made an unsuccessful appeal for corporate membership New Power argued that they were technically not an affiliate of EPMI who holds the Corporate Membership EES for example has associate member status It was pointed out by ERCOT that EPMI listed New Power as a corporate affiliate on their application for corporate membership Mariann e Carroll represented New Power in the appeal and stated that EPMI did not ask her advice prior to listing New Power as affiliate An additional rationale cited by New Power was that in the future Reliant Energy wants to spin off their generation company and that when they do they should be

is a brief summary of many of the points that directly affect the ERCOT market I will provide a complete summary and timeline for response or request for rehearing on any of the issues later this week Two of the most noticeable departures from the Protocols was for the Commission to ask for a review of the balanced schedule requirement and a departure from the current bilateral market to an LMP type market The Commission directed ERCOT to respond with the technical feasibility of relaxing or eliminating the balanced schedule requirement The other departure from the ERCOT protocols by the Commission is in reference to loc al or intrazonal congestion The Commission states that if direct assignment of the local congestion to the generating resources is not possible they will consider other market options such as an LMP model The Commission will review both of these market concepts in September The ERCOT Protocol Review Subcommittee will take the ordered protocols and start the process of Protocol Revision Each of the revisions have been assigned a completion date by the PUCT and can be found in schedule attached The PUCT approved the ERCOT petition and Ordered the that the Protocols should take effect June The Commission state that the Protocols a re fundamentally sound however there are certain provisions that are boxed cannot take effect until the ERCOT system can accommodate them as provide d for in the Protocol Implementation Plan ERCOT was directed to initiate a process to implement the boxed provisions as soon as possible As for the rest of the changed required by the PUCT a timeline was attached for the implementation of the protocol revisions Under the Protocols as filed ERCOT had sole discretion for its con duct however the PUCT will require ERCOT to exercise its discretion in a reasonable nondiscriminatory manner Ancillary Services The Protocols require ERCOT to procure the following Ancillary Services sequentially through an Auction regulation down regulation up responsive reserves and nonspinning reserves The PUCT is concerned that the process results in the possibility of price reversals where the clearing price for some AS may be higher than other higher grade AS services which may create incentives to game the system The PUCT directed ERCOT to amend the Protocols such that it will procure AS through use of simultaneous optimization for assignment of resources to AS product s and will set prices for each AS to the corresponding shadow price The PU CT also ordered to ERCOT to amend the protocols such that it will use a two settlement system for the procurement of AS The day ahead period procurement will settle and announce at with the second to take place during the adjustment period for each hour Until the system is capable of the twosettlement system ERCOT must amend the system to only allow downwa rd adjustment of prices for unselected AS bids and allow unselected bids by a QSE to be withdrawn only in descending order of bid prices The wrinkle he re is that the ERCOT system purges unselected bids and will require a manual tracking of the bids A spot check for the activity has been discu ssed Finally ERCOT is to consider and report whether or not ERCOT should make conditional selections of AS bids from a QSE portfolio and then possible deselect based on location and not price after the QSE resource plans are published Market Solution Under the ERCOT protocols a Market Solution for reducing congestion exists when at least three unaffiliated resources have available capacity and the ability to submit a bid to ERCOT to solve a circumstance o f local congestion and no one bidder is essential to solve the congestion T he PUCT would like the protocol amended to require that a market solution exists only when at least three bids are received from unaffiliated resourc es Out of Merit Order OOM Service The PUCT directs ERCOT to use the same ratcheting sown mechanism for out of merit order capacity payments to out o f merit order energy payments that are based on the heat rates Reliability MustRun Service The PUCT would like to have additional incentives for generation entities to enter into RMR service contracts and that once covered the until will be efficiently utilized As such ERCOT is to amen the Protocols to give an RMR unit owner the additional option for retaining of net positive margins for energy generated in excess of the amount that the unit is obligated to produce under its RMR contract Uninstructed Deviations In order to encourage good price chasing and discourage bad price chasing ERCOT was ordered to amend the Protoc ols to apply the ex ante MCPE for balancing energy set ten minutes for the beginni ng of a settlement interval to all instructed deployment of balancing energy during the settlement interval and use the second subsequent interval ex poste MCPE which will be set five minutes after the end of the first settlement interval for uninstructed deviations during the first load interval Bid Caps During the transition period until July there shall b e a generation resource bid cap of per MWh for energy that ERCOT procures The bid cap does not apply to load resources ERCOT was also directed to develop and submit for possible approval a bid cap on capacity bids for generation resource offering to provide replacement reserve servic e Balance Schedule Requirement The current Protocols require QSEs submit a balanced schedule however the PUCT intends to consider in September the policy implications of the balanced schedule requirement and whether t he requirement should be relaxed or eliminated ERCOT was also directed to report on the technical implications of relaxing or eliminating the balance d schedule requirement Interzonal Congestion ERCOT shall amend the Protocols to convert to the direct assignment of interzonal congestion costs and base direct assignme nt of interzonal congestion costs on an adjustable commercial model that employs operational shift factors on the CSCs The Commission will also require ERCOT to publish advisory updates or forecasts of the shift factors corresponding to CSCs to reflect predicted operating conditions and contingencies ERCOTs obligation to guarantee full zonetozone congesti on cost insurance to those who acquire TCRs in proportions based on forecasted shift factors shall be eliminated The result of this is that a TCR portfolio that provides a full hedge of interzonal congestion cost based o n the forecasted shift factors will not guarantee a full hedge

useitorlooseit feature will resu lt in inefficient usage of the transmission system As such the Commission direc ts ERCOT to amends the protocols to define TCRs as pure financial instruments and

is a brief summary of many of the points that directly affect the ERCOT market I will provide a complete summary and timeline for response or request for rehearing on any of the issues later this week Two of the most noticeable departures from the Protocols was for the Commission to ask for a review of the balanced schedule requirement and a departure from the current bilateral market to an LMP type market The Commission directed ERCOT to respond with the technical feasibility of relaxing or eliminating the balanced schedule requirement The other departure from the ERCOT protocols by the Commission is in reference to loc al or intrazonal congestion The Commission states that if direct assignment of the local congestion to the generating resources is not possible they will consider other market options such as an LMP model The Commission will review both of these market concepts in September The ERCOT Protocol Review Subcommittee will take the ordered protocols and start the process of Protocol Revision Each of the revisions have been assigned a completion date by the PUCT and can be found in schedule attached The PUCT approved the ERCOT petition and Ordered the that the Protocols should take effect June The Commission state that the Protocols a re fundamentally sound however there are certain provisions that are boxed cannot take effect until the ERCOT system can accommodate them as provide d for in the Protocol Implementation Plan ERCOT was directed to initiate a process to implement the boxed provisions as soon as possible As for the rest of the changed required by the PUCT a timeline was attached for the implementation of the protocol revisions Under the Protocols as filed ERCOT had sole discretion for its con duct however the PUCT will require ERCOT to exercise its discretion in a reasonable nondiscriminatory manner Ancillary Services The Protocols require ERCOT to procure the following Ancillary Services sequentially through an Auction regulation down regulation up responsive reserves and nonspinning reserves The PUCT is concerned that the process results in the possibility of price reversals where the clearing price for some AS may be higher than other higher grade AS services which may create incentives to game the system The PUCT directed ERCOT to amend the Protocols such that it will procure AS through use of simultaneous optimization for assignment of resources to AS product s and will set prices for each AS to the corresponding shadow price The PU CT also ordered to ERCOT to amend the protocols such that it will use a two settlement system for the procurement of AS The day ahead period procurement will settle and announce at with the second to take place during the adjustment period for each hour Until the system is capable of the twosettlement system ERCOT must amend the system to only allow downwa rd adjustment of prices for unselected AS bids and allow unselected bids by a QSE to be withdrawn only in descending order of bid prices The wrinkle he re is that the ERCOT system purges unselected bids and will require a manual tracking of the bids A spot check for the activity has been discu ssed Finally ERCOT is to consider and report whether or not ERCOT should make conditional selections of AS bids from a QSE portfolio and then possible deselect based on location and not price after the QSE resource plans are published Market Solution Under the ERCOT protocols a Market Solution for reducing congestion exists when at least three unaffiliated resources have available capacity and the ability to submit a bid to ERCOT to solve a circumstance o f local congestion and no one bidder is essential to solve the congestion T he PUCT would like the protocol amended to require that a market solution exists only when at least three bids are received from unaffiliated resourc es Out of Merit Order OOM Service The PUCT directs ERCOT to use the same ratcheting sown mechanism for out of merit order capacity payments to out o f merit order energy payments that are based on the heat rates Reliability MustRun Service The PUCT would like to have additional incentives for generation entities to enter into RMR service contracts and that once covered the until will be efficiently utilized As such ERCOT is to amen the Protocols to give an RMR unit owner the additional option for retaining of net positive margins for energy generated in excess of the amount that the unit is obligated to produce under its RMR contract Uninstructed Deviations In order to encourage good price chasing and discourage bad price chasing ERCOT was ordered to amend the Protoc ols to apply the ex ante MCPE for balancing energy set ten minutes for the beginni ng of a settlement interval to all instructed deployment of balancing energy during the settlement interval and use the second subsequent interval ex poste MCPE which will be set five minutes after the end of the first settlement interval for uninstructed deviations during the first load interval Bid Caps During the transition period until July there shall b e a generation resource bid cap of per MWh for energy that ERCOT procures The bid cap does not apply to load resources ERCOT was also directed to develop and submit for possible approval a bid cap on capacity bids for generation resource offering to provide replacement reserve servic e Balance Schedule Requirement The current Protocols require QSEs submit a balanced schedule however the PUCT intends to consider in September the policy implications of the balanced schedule requirement and whether t he requirement should be relaxed or eliminated ERCOT was also directed to report on the technical implications of relaxing or eliminating the balance d schedule requirement Interzonal Congestion ERCOT shall amend the Protocols to convert to the direct assignment of interzonal congestion costs and base direct assignme nt of interzonal congestion costs on an adjustable commercial model that employs operational shift factors on the CSCs The Commission will also require ERCOT to publish advisory updates or forecasts of the shift factors corresponding to CSCs to reflect predicted operating conditions and contingencies ERCOTs obligation to guarantee full zonetozone congesti on cost insurance to those who acquire TCRs in proportions based on forecasted shift factors shall be eliminated The result of this is that a TCR portfolio that provides a full hedge of interzonal congestion cost based o n the forecasted shift factors will not guarantee a full hedge against the actual congestion charges The Commission does not like ERCOT to be in the business of insuring transmission users against changes in shift factors The Commission also feels that useitorlooseit feature will resu lt in inefficient usage of the transmission system As such the Commission direc ts ERCOT to amends the protocols to define TCRs as pure financial instruments and eliminate use it or loose it As for the TCR Auction a single round combinatorial auction is more appropriate Bids can take the form of pricequantity pairs for TCR portfolios or single TCRs Preassigned TCRs MOUs and Coops that own or have a longterm annual capacity and energy commitment from a specific remote generation re source shall be preassigned TCRs Other Stakeholders argued that the preassigning of TCRs reduces the amount available to the market and increases congest costs borne by other market participants The Protocols however will be changed to state that the preassigned TCRs are subject to change or elimination at any time upon ERCOT Board of Directors approvals or Commissi on Order Intrazonal Congestion ERCOT shall amend the Protocols to require direct assignment in intrazonal congestion management costs through a usage fee based on the flow over the congested intrazonal interfaces The usage fee shall apply to the generation resources that cause the congestion fee The net revenues from the usage fee shall be distributed or credited against uplift charges However the Commission advises that to the extent feasibl e under the zonal portfoliobased model embodied in the Protocols ERCOT sha ll promptly notify the commission so that the Commission can promptly conside r ordering the implementation of other alternative congestion management methods

congestion costs takes place then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong element If direct assignmnet of the congestion andor designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model John Meyer Shmuel Oren and most parties would agree with that This year will be very telling It would be worthwhile the coordinate with John prior to RTO week Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Mon AM To Twiggs Thane Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean

ERCOT works What will he say Thanks Jim Original Message From Twiggs Thane Sent Monday October AM To Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean Subject RE FERC Looking at ERCOT Here are a couple of clarifying points The congestion charges that have been incurred are million or million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is MM based upong the ERCOT protocols The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept was MM Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the MM trigger was hit August ERCOT has month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion rather a direct assignment of the charge The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion Original Message

<3993275.1075861633603.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,thane.twiggs@enron.com,2001-11-15 07:01:14,RE ASAP please ERCOT Questions OOMC OOME Cc Here are a few additional points I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week he is the director of technic al operations and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a be ready instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy He is John Adams boss so there is a disconnect between the two levels In addition to Kent I spok e to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment or lack th ereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlem ent statement and use that process Going forward however that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove your cost structure In speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convin ced John Adams but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that would help Original Message From Portz David SentWednesday November PM ToNicolay Christi L CcGilbertsmith Doug Baughman Edward D Miller Jeffrey Forney Jo hn M SubjectErcot Questions OOMC OOME Forwarded as discussed Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant and sidesteps the obligation to pa y an OOME price component when the plants output is utilized by ERCOT Th e OOMC compensation is currently negligible and recovery of actual costs u nder Protocols Sec may take a long time and the OOME compensa tion has various problems as well the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME the the lesser the OOME price paid Protocols Sec Heat Ra te value decreases and plants directed to provide say MWs of OOM COOME are not allowed to generate above MWs in an interval thus runn ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate to sell the excess in the marketplace The Frontera plant a customer of EPMI acting as QSE is locat ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS E to provide OOMC to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh ould be Reliability Must Run RMR and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system reliability I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols conducted under Protocols Section and we would appreciate any reg group efforts toward preparation for iinit iating such dispute Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom orrow even if ERCOT tells us their QSE that it should be dispatched Thus we are caught in the middle The legitimate bases for not complying with a n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section thr eat to safety risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols Though the Protocols Sections seem to recognize as to other capacity oriented ancillary service pr oducts that it is generating capacity available but not energy delivered t o the grid I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC The Operating Gui des definition of OOMC page seems to recognize this however and Secti on B of the ERCOT Market Guide p Feb recognizes the distinc tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi on stated by John Forney below Sorry for the long email I was trying to provide a statting point for y our group Original Message From Forney John M SentWednesday November PM ToPortz David Gilbertsmith Doug SubjectErcot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions s tarting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi ds exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formu la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o ut this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actua l energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the p rotocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the s pirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot disp atchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC mea ns run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Er cot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to r un by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal c as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding th is issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er cots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal c rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we woul d receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someo ne else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo st money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OO ME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagre ement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in ho pes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comme nt Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo sure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in respons e to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled E rcot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their vie w was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compli ance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME de ployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a softwar e issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett led Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would re quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in struction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr uction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic en vironment to generate for and sell for Further operations pers onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney

Zone model for use in commercial congestion management for Effective date is January The three CSCs are GrahamParker kV DCKT SandowTemple kV DCKT and STPDOW kV DCKT The four CM Zones are West North South and Houston A po wer point presentation along with a map is available at CSCDATAcschtm Current Congestion Cost and Outlook The congestion charges that have been incurred are million or million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it i s MM based upon the ERCOT protocols The actual cost to redispatch and clear congestion as of Sept was MM Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the MM trigger was hit August ERCOT has month by Protoc ol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestio n rather a direct assignment of the charge The charge may be partially of fset by the TCR that will be auctioned The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge I am chairing the congestion management work ing group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit I will attach a copy of the current draft of the TCR white paper In short the TCR is a financia l option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion There is no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR There will be an auction on or about the th of February and the full zonal implementation will tak e place February The tentative schedule is as follows Distribute draft TCR White Paper Review and edit draft TCR White Paper Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS WMS Meeting vote on PRR TAC Meeting Board Meeting ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Con gestion Costs Capacity Auction The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round There was an initial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and ho w the standard was oneway and the buyers of capacity were left without rec ourse There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professional s to discuss the issues I did not participate and there will be an addit ional meeting on the th The purpose of the shortterm meeting are to re ctify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July auctions Substantive issues such as the actual products zone determinati on and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the Septem ber auction which includes annual products Protocol Implementation ERCOT is in the process of determining what shoul d be included in the Phase II design which will begin January There is a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to deter mine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items A SAP Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the PUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II Issues that do not require major system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is sta rted immediately There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs and loads acting as resources Mechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services The PUCT ha s expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the ancillary services market if it is assumed that the various ancillary ser vices have different levels of value to the market The Board had approve d a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets how ever the plan has not been implemented The WMS discussed at length the issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets nonspinning regulati on and responsive reserve A task force was formed to initially identify the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of a ncillary services issue It was suggested that a consultant be hired to de velop Protocol language once the principles are identified The first task force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled DemandSide Task Force Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load BUL Market Issues an d other demandside issues The PUCT expects the full functionality to be in place on January The DSTF met last on October st third meeti ng The DSTF completed a draft status report on DemandSide Resources and Demand Responsiveness It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not comp lete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board Howeve r ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in the demand side of ERCOTs market reviews the PUCTs directive reviews t he role of demandside resources in ERCOTs markets and identifies the iss ues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing It also summari zes the options discussed by the DSTF to date The PUCT staff has suggeste d that ERCOT hire a consultant such as Eric Hirsch to provide more resour ces for this effort The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address d irect load control issues at its next meeting Unit Specific Deployments At the next WMS meeting October there will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will di scuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the ramp rates of the deployments The WMS will develop a list of issues and case studies for ERCOT to discuss The WMS also briefly discussed PRR related to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation

NewsWatch Latest headlines SAN DIEGO CBSMW The federal government will provide grants and loans to help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills President Clinton said Wednesday Clinton said million will be earmarked to help lowincome families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled He urged the Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are struggling to pay power bills He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Well do what we can to help you the president said during a televised news conference at the White House in Washington Test case yields public outcry The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation The region which also encompasses South Orange County north of San Diego is the first in the nation to have its power market completely deregulated New York New England and midAtlantic states are following suit and theyre watching California carefully Thus far the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles Electricity supply that hasnt increased in years failed this summer to meet strong demand resulting from a growing state With market forces in play for the first time strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was passed along to residents After a public outcry the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday approved a plan that would cap customers electric bills for normal use but theyll pay market rates for anything extra Utility companies also can collect on any shortfalls later Today on CBS MarketWatch Nasdaq inches higher Dow lags Oil inventories at year low Commentary Garzarelli sees stock rally in fourth quarter Amazoncom enters car market California is electric industry test case More top stories CBS MarketWatch Columns Updated PMET In other words if the electric company cant pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now theyll be able to pass it along months later Therefore people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the cooler months in fall and winter wont see much of a dropoff Its a shameful paynoworpaylater plan said Bob Finkelstein staff attorney for the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group California jumped off the deregulation cliff State legislators which have the power to expand on the commissions ruling shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid levels and cap them for customers of San Diego Gas Electric a Sempra Energy SRE news msgs subsidiary They faced opposition from Gov Gray Davis a Democrat and from Republican lawmakers Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by percent immediately but that would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers money to help pay electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits San Diego fiasco The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated electricity market that began two years ago The effects of deregulation are being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its rate freeze last summer The rest of California should follow region after region by The idea sounded good Deregulate the electric industry and let the market set the prices With competition rates should come down and service should improve When the longdistance phone market was deregulated it did bring about low prices and greater competition But things got messed up along the way For one the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among longdistance carriers was dashed at least for now Initially hundreds of companies had signed up to offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market Of the remaining companies most serve the more lucrative corporate market said Linda Sherry a spokeswoman at Consumer Action Also the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives and negotiate better rates didnt pan out Sherry said Demand far outstrips supply Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew But supply didnt grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for years Last year the state approved five applications to build new plants but theyre years away from becoming operational Under the deregulated market electric utility companies were mandated to sell their power generation plants By separating the provider of electricity and the generator of electricity the idea is to usher in a more competitive market Today San Diego Gas Electric buys from electric generators through an auction market But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San Diego worse According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when electric utilities accept bids from generators

NewsWatch Latest headlines SAN DIEGO CBSMW The federal government will provide grants and loans to help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills President Clinton said Wednesday Clinton said million will be earmarked to help lowincome families and seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled He urged the Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are struggling to pay power bills He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Well do what we can to help you the president said during a televised news conference at the White House in Washington Test case yields public outcry The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the feasibility of electric industry deregulation The region which also encompasses South Orange County north of San Diego is the first in the nation to have its power market completely deregulated New York New England and midAtlantic states are following suit and theyre watching California carefully Thus far the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles Electricity supply that hasnt increased in years failed this summer to meet strong demand resulting from a growing state With market forces in play for the first time strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was passed along to residents After a public outcry the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday approved a plan that would cap customers electric bills for normal use but theyll pay market rates for anything extra Utility companies also can collect on any shortfalls later Today on CBS MarketWatch Nasdaq inches higher Dow lags Oil inventories at year low Commentary Garzarelli sees stock rally in fourth quarter Amazoncom enters car market California is electric industry test case More top stories CBS MarketWatch Columns Updated PMET In other words if the electric company cant pass along the entire cost of buying the energy for now theyll be able to pass it along months later Therefore people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the cooler months in fall and winter wont see much of a dropoff Its a shameful paynoworpaylater plan said Bob Finkelstein staff attorney for the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group California jumped off the deregulation cliff State legislators which have the power to expand on the commissions ruling shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid levels and cap them for customers of San Diego Gas Electric a Sempra Energy SRE news msgs subsidiary They faced opposition from Gov Gray Davis a Democrat and from Republican lawmakers Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by percent immediately but that would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers money to help pay electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits San Diego fiasco The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated electricity market that began two years ago The effects of deregulation are being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its rate freeze last summer The rest of California should follow region after region by The idea sounded good Deregulate the electric industry and let the market set the prices With competition rates should come down and service should improve When the longdistance phone market was deregulated it did bring about low prices and greater competition But things got messed up along the way For one the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for electricity as they shop for better deals among longdistance carriers was dashed at least for now Initially hundreds of companies had signed up to offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market Of the remaining companies most serve the more lucrative corporate market said Linda Sherry a spokeswoman at Consumer Action Also the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives and negotiate better rates didnt pan out Sherry said Demand far outstrips supply Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew But supply didnt grow with it because no new electric generation plants have been built in the state for years Last year the state approved five applications to build new plants but theyre years away from becoming operational Under the deregulated market electric utility companies were mandated to sell their power generation plants By separating the provider of electricity and the generator of electricity the idea is to usher in a more competitive market Today San Diego Gas Electric buys from electric generators through an auction market But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San Diego worse According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices they are required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid But in a situation where the electric company needs all the power available it has to accept all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal inflating the cost Electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more Sherry said FERC is investigating and plans to issue a report later this year But for now price caps have been set Utility company buffeted Ed Van Herik a Sempra spokesman said the auction rules are putting the squeeze on utility companies already buffeted from all sides
