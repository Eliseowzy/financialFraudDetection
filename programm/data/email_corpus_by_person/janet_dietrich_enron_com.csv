boy same weight as my nd girl lbs oz Thats really great Louise Are you g etting any sleep Hate to hit you with business but someone said youre on email so I thought Id try Were basically finished reviewingtweaking the business models w ithin EES and its probably time to see if we can bring closure to the SIC Code split Im forwarding you a couple of emails to help remind you where we were on this but basically we had general agreement on the SIC Code sp lit we just needed to agree on the volumetric delineation point for the EN A SIC Codes I had proposed MW MMBtud and below would fall to EES you had proposed MWMMBtud and below The majority of EES business will fall within the Eastern Interconnect and my split had more to do wit h the fact that the ENA OriginatorsMidMarketers were focused on MW and above After the meetings we just went through with the EES sales groups I would be surprised if many of our customer targets have sites MWs i n the ENA SIC Codes I dont foresee any major issues if we lower the delin eation point to MWs Would love to get your views soon if possible If youd like me to follow u p with John L since youre out I can certainly do so Also Ive met with the Industrial Market group Ray Bowen and weve set up a coordination pl an for EIMEES to lever the relationships that each organization currently has where the other group may have opportunities Forwarded by Janet R DietrichHOUEES on PM David W Delainey PM ToLouise CT ccJohn J LavoratoCorpEnron Janet R ES SubjectStill working on it but heres where we are Louise I would like you to reconsider our original proposal for a few rea sons I have a lot of history on this one given Ive been on both sides of the fence and was the original creator of what ultimately became the EIM g roup As a result I have been in many discussions with Lou and Jeff on t hese issues In the original agreement between EES and ENA the following SIC codes were excluded from EES as part of the minority shareholder agreement in Mining except Oil and Gas Oil and Gas Extraction Textile Manufacturing Paper Manufacturing Chemical Manufacturing Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing Glass Manufacturing Primary Metal Manufacturing Fabricated and Metals Products Manufacturing Machinery Manufacturing Rail Transportation All other SIC codes fell within EES In with the buyback of the min ority shareholders Lou Jeff and I agreed to move several of the lower pro cess load SIC codes into EES including Textile Manufacturing like Springs Industries Glass Manufacturing like Owens Corning Fabricated and Metal s Product Manufacturing like General Cable and American National Can and Machinery Manufacturing like Lockheed Martin This was primarily because these customers tend to be of lower energy sophistication and consumption numerous sites in deregulated and regulated environments and of small si ze The EES value proposition fit these customers much better than wholesa le We have completed numerous significant term transactions and outsource s in these industries see parenthesis for several For the other SIC codes these remained in ENA and EIM EES has no interes t in paper mills smelters fertilizer manufacturers refiners etc We ne ither have the products or pricing capability to manage or close very large process oriented consumers However there are divisions inside these com panies that we have been able to have some success For example the speci ality chemicals divisions of the large chemical companies tend to be signif icantly smaller loads and ignored from a capital DSM and commodity point o f view by the large purchasing agents Another example is the gasoline re tailing networks for the large oil and gasrefining companies which can be very small loads spread over thousands of sites Another example is the s pecialty papercontainer board divisions of the paper companies In severa l of the large oil and gas and petrochemical companies we have found fertil e ground in their office buildings and research centers Our proposal to l imit EESs activities in the ENA SIC codes by consumption size was to give us some freedom to target these divisions inside these companies which ENA would normally ignore If there is a better way to split this out than by a size definition lets discuss Finally given the more targeted and sophi sticated sales process utilized in EES by necessity it would be easier t o coordinate between the companies based on a size sort where EES had limit ed access to ENAs SIC codes versus the opposite On the surface your proposal looks reasonable however it fails to suffici ently manage the issues For example how would you manage a customer like WalMart which may use more than MW at a site but requires a national or regional solution for all sites in both deregulated and regulated jurisdictions how will we sufficiently manage the ENA sales force which tends to ove rcover and underproduct for the vast majority of these industries and c ustomers ie I think it would be a disaster for EES and ENA and EES has the relationship based selling capability and basic produc ts to successfully manage these customers you could argue right now that i s all we have On a final note I believe strongly that John and I should send out a note to both organizations clarifying these issues because a it is way overdue years in fact it was always difficult when I wa s upstairs to get Lou to cooperate b it is extremely destructive and unproductive for multiple Enron grou ps to communicate and target the same customer c I dont believe that the employees on both side of the fence will h onor the obligation unless it is expressly stated openly communicated and enforced by the two management teams and d we need to be proactive because cleaning it up after the dual call etc significantly damages our credibility as Enron with a number of t hese customers It may be worthwhile in the same exercise to let you know what we may be do ing in the the utility and generator markets in the interest of open commun ication and ensure your buyin I look forward to futher discussing this with you Our motivations are not to try and enter ENA markets but to split the industrial and commercial se gments between the two companies clearly which increases productivity and s hareholder value Regards Delainey

address your concerns and engage your feedback Now heres what were going to do based on your feedback STOCK PRICE We are all concerned about our stock price which has declined significantly this year The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include A decline in the overall market and economy Certain Enronspecific issues such as California India and recent management turnover A meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as of our stock price at the high Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has Enron We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve Over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward Mark Koenig executive vice president of Investor Relations will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions Greg Whalley Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide Watch for these events THE PRC The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives Nevertheless we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern and we believe we can improve refine streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone Therefore we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to yearend Effective immediately relative performance discussions will occur annually at yearend However business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron Business units will be asked to identify only their top and bottom performers for review by Enrons Office of the Chairman annually at yearend We will continue to use the PEP degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year Finally we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes In the November issue of Enron Business we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process In addition there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to yearend EMPLOYEE MORALE We believe the stock price our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale Additionally some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns Effective immediately we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources HR rep We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations ER that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman Cindy Olson will head this function More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days Over the long term we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles We will encourage vice presidents and above as well as other current and emerging leaders to complete Executive Impact Influence training These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people Additionally we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate which will be rolled out immediately Communicate is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video voice mails emails and meetings notes to analyze user performance based on a participants responses and actions EXTERNAL REPUTATION We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees We recognize that as Enrons ambassadors in the marketplace the more you know about our strategy performance and challenges the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company To ensure you are better informed We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron In addition to our existing communication efforts like email messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business we will post a QA on current issues on the Enron intranet at homeenroncom This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers As we said before Greg Mark and I as well as members of our Management Committee will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges Look for these to start in midOctober INTEGRITY RESPECT I believe as I said previously we need to reinforce our core values particularly integrity and respect From what you have told us in this survey you agree Enrons values will have more importance in each employees evaluation and feedback We ask that all employees regardless of level hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional specific feedback on employee issues like ethics integrity and individual concerns If you would like to participate in these focus groups please send an email to Cindy Olson Periodically I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results Finally I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enrons strategy and challenges and listening to your concerns and ideas But we would ask for your commitment too We need your dedication to Enron and its values as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve longterm success We will conduct another employee survey early next year Please continue to send me your feedback and lets continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world
