changing political dynamics in the Senatecoupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug costsmay soon mean a renewed effort on the issue The House Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug bill it is drafting several key sources said The idea would be to save the government money by removing some barriers faced by generic copies of brandname drugs when they are ready to go to market sources said But any changes to the HatchWaxman lawnamed for its sponsors Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah and Rep Henry Waxman D Califcould open up a multitude of other drug patent issues that have bogged down reform for years That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between one bill or the other said a prescription drug industry source The brandname drug industry so far has been reluctant to back efforts to change the HatchWaxman law But the generic drug industry said it would welcome the change If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit it makes great sense to enact a generic drug bill said a lobbyist for the generic drug industry Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and by Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio could save as much as billion sponsors estimate CBO has yet to score them But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug companies say they could be forced to make The researchbased pharmaceutical industry estimates that it will spend about billion on research and development this year compared with billion in The industry says it develops about percent of the worlds drugs in the United States The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next Wednesday on generic drugs nonprescription drugs and other issues But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much into the scheduling of the hearing In noticing the hearing no one should try to read between the lines the spokesman said Right now were looking at a wide range of options In the end our goal is to address the issue of escalating prices without harming research and innovation HatchWaxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to Democratic control in the Senate While aides said no official discussions have taken place on moving a genericdrug bill since this weeks Democratic takeover members of at least three panelsthe Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee the Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committeehave expressed interest And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman To those who would propose to change the legislation I would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill and caution against making changes that tilt the balance Hatch told a May hearing Yet no law is so perfect that it cannot stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a changing marketplace and society Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill earlier this year that would require genericdrug companies that enter deals with brandname companies to keep their products off the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the Justice Department Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year a spokesman said By April Fulton ENERGY Armey Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican energy policy House Majority Leader Armey and Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahomaboth of whom represent oilrich statesclashed publicly this week on what action Congress should take to address the rising costs and diminishing supplies of the nations energy Responsible for House communications strategy Watts called on House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the volatile prices facing energy consumers this year We need to get answers from energy company executives including producers suppliers refiners transporters distributors and retailers with the goals of finding solutions to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the public Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen Responding to a reporters question Tuesday Armey said he opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of price gouging by the energy industry I would not personally see the need Armey said Why would one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political demagoguery And that is what it is Armey added If people want to look at the companies point their fingers at them thats just nonsense I dont care who it comes from It is just nonsense Without specifically recommending hearings Watts again urged Republican members Wednesday to provide the American people with answers about the current energy crunch saying he favored the measures proposed under President Bushs energy plan While Democrats overstate the role government should play in energy policy Republicans cannot forget that it does have a role Watts wrote in his latest memo While price caps are not an option we must insist on price accountability The Watts memo based on New Models polling data produced by Republican pollster David Winston reflects GOP concerns about the Democratic energy assault Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the party switch of Sen James Jeffords IVt instead of the Republican trillion tax cut It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on Jeffords a Watts aide said To keep the GOP tax relief message alive Watts suggested in his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer From public service announcements to franked mailings the possibilities are endless and Conference is developing a number of resources for you to use Watts wrote In his memo Watts also urged members to redouble their efforts to talk about the passage of education reform There is no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education just because the vote was gaveled he wrote An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between Armey and Watts Its just a question of exploring options the spokesman said By Mark Wegner APPROPRIATIONS Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps Kills School Lunch Program In the first test of FY appropriations spending limits House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans defeated a million proposal Wednesday to continue the international school lunch foodaid program After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla RTexas not to break the caps the subcommittee voted against the amendment sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur DOhio to the FY Agriculture appropriations bill Rep Jo Ann Emerson RMo voted with the Democrats in favor of the proposal Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican subcommittee members nervous Rep James Walsh RNY quickly proposed report language that the subcommittee strongly urges the Agriculture Department to continue the program formally known as the Global Food for Education Initiative Former Sen George McGovern DSD now US ambassador to the world food agencies in Rome and former Senate Majority Leader Dole have promoted it Kaptur asked Walsh to change the strongly urges wording to expects and the report language passed unanimously However after the markup session Kaptur said that she does not know what impact the report language will have She is inclined to re offer the amendment in full committee Bonilla initially suggested the report language but House Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis pressed for the vote saying that if the subcommittee cant get together on food aid to kids who need it he did not know what measures it could agree on The Clinton administration started the international school lunch initiative using its administrative authority to distribute surplus commodities It did not have to be scored in FY subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush administration has not stated a clear position on the school lunch initiative yet They believe a directive from the subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment for next year The subcommittee later approved the bill which provides billion for all programs of which billion is discretionary funding The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs Excluding billion in emergency appropriations in the FY bill it contains a percent increase Kaptur who has had testy relations with Bonilla said the bill was better than we expected By Jerry Hagstrom APPROPRIATIONS Dem Appropriators Criticize Administrations NSF Funding Request A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the administrations request for funding for the National Science Foundation saying it was inadequate to fully support the agencys research efforts and failed to move toward the panels goal of doubling NSF funding over five years National Journals Technology Daily reported I am disappointed in the administrations overall research and development budget and the NSF proposal in particular said Senate VAHUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski DMd This is the first time in the NSFs year history that an administration has requested Congress to cut NSFs research budget below the previous years level The administration requested billion for NSF in FY a million increase or percent which is less than the rate of inflation NSFs budget would have to rise by about million in FY to meet the goal of doubling in five years Mikulski said She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell Is this million increase what you wanted or is this what you got Colwell defended the budget request saying it focuses on areas the administration has identified as priorities such as education and training But she also added that she fully supports the panels efforts to double NSFs budget The NSF proposal calls for an percent increase for education and human resources including million for math and science partnerships and million for a program that puts graduate students in K classrooms The proposal also would increase stipends for graduate fellowships We are losing our best and brightest science students to other fields said Eamon Kelly chairman of the National Science Board who expressed support for the budget proposal Even our future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform their tasks Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of science and math education and worker literacy But she also noted the value of funding basic research in science and technology saying that if NSF had not done the work it began years ago I dont believe wed have the information technology we have today Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSFs support for nanoscale science and engineering research by percent Nanotechnology could change the way almost everything is designed from medicines to computers to automobiles The budget request would increase funding for research and related areas by percent to billion Members of the House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon characterized that funding level as inadequate About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request is that its disappointing said Rep Eddie Bernice Johnson D Texas Testifying at the House hearing NSF Deputy Director Joseph Bordogna said the budgets focus on people was intentional NSF is as much about building a worldclass workforce as it is about discovery he said It is important to emphasize that research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is fundamental to NSFs mission By Robert Lamb APPROPRIATIONS Despite Shrunken Surplus GOP Sees Increased FY Cushion Despite CBOs reduced estimate of next years surplus Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY budget cushion of about billioneven after setting aside the politically untouchable Medicare trustfund surplus GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller thanallowed costs of the FY share of the trillion tax cut The experts explained their estimates of the figures in response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the FY cushion may have sagged to as low as billion based on CBOs revised surplus estimates Democrats meanwhile countered that the tax cut which President Bush plans to sign today relies on an accounting gimmick in FY to make additional money available In FY and beyond this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trustfund surplusdespite language in the budget resolution that bars Congress from doing so In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt DSC planned to release today Democrats charge that the trillion tax cut exhausts the available surplus in through and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and Medicare even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits in the budget resolution The FY budget resolution approved by Congress used CBOs January baseline to project a total FY budget surplus of billion with an onbudget surplus of billion of which billion comes from the Medicare Part A trustfund surplus The remaining billion of the surplus was left as a reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget including the increase in defense spending expected to result from Defense Secretary Rumsfelds strategic review Last week CBO released its analysis of the presidents budget using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the surplus by billion In April CBO recalculated the FY Medicare trust fund at billionor billion larger than estimated in January Taken together CBOs most recent estimates of the total surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of the FY reserve by billion leaving only billion in the reserve The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by billion in FY But the final tax package that Congress enacted as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation carries an FY price tag of just billionmeaning that billion budgeted for but not spent in the tax bill should be included in the available FY surplus CBOs January baseline produced a reserve of nearly billion for FY assuming the tax bill would use up the entire billion provided in the budget Because the tax bill actually cost billion less the reserve instead would amount to about billion using the January surplus estimates Using the less generous May baseline and the morethan billion reserve it produces the unspent portion of the tax bill would take the FY reserve to almost billion In both cases the reserve represents the size of the surplus after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set aside In the analysis being issued today Democrats say the size of the tax cut means that funding priorities like defense modernization a Medicare prescription drug benefit or educationpriorities that even Republicans supportwill require a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes Either the resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social Security and Medicare or funding of other national priorities must be severely cutsimply because the tax cut is too big The Democratic analysis uses CBOs May baseline and includes the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the budget resolution adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation It projects an available surplus outside the Social Security and Medicare trust funds of billion in FY a figure that accounts for billion in debt service costsbut a deficit of billion in FY and a billion deficit in FY As for the FY surplus Democrats counter that Republicans were only able to show a surplus by using a billion accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY to FY As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with the budget resolution a provision delays the deadline for corporate estimatedtax payments from September to October effectively making the billion in estimated revenue available on the first day of FY instead of at the end of FY By Lisa Caruso TRADE AntiNAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be facing this year is the establishment of a freetrade agreement with Chile A group of labor and environmental organizations known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans today to step up lobbying against the deal The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Friends of the Earth along with a number of labor groups from Chile The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with Chile worked out by the end of the year It is expected that such an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free Trade Agreement which many labor environmental and human rights groups charge has adversely affected US jobs and environmental standards in the business corridor along the USMexican border Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade with Chile are Sens Christopher Dodd DConn and Phil Gramm R Texas Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed trade deal sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the bitter NAFTA controversy While significant differences remain between the United States and Chile over the details of the deal the administration has stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a Free Trade Area of Americas and the Chilean pact would help advance that effort In addition such a pact would help Chile play a higher profile role in South American political and economic affairs than its rival Brazil To help bring about the FTAA many observers believe it is essential for the president to have broad presidential trade negotiating authority Formerly known as fast track the proposal is moving up on the congressional agenda House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to see a measure on the floor as soon as July and Senate Finance Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential tradenegotiating authority But Baucus has insisted that labor and environmental matters be taken into account This week the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to Congress members It outlines a spate of bilateral trade agreements in recent yearsoften without US participation and at the expense of the United States To shore up the US role in trade matters the Business Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration calls trade promotion authority as quickly as possible By Stephen Norton TECHNOLOGY HighTech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a higher priority in the chamber members of the Silicon Valley lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the issue National Journals Technology Daily reported In a conference call earlier this week lobbyists for high tech companies including HewlettPackard Cisco Systems Sun Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy principles without advocating or opposing any particular legislation The list then could be used to educate senators on how to view any particular privacy bill Companies are still trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of legislation or not said one person familiar with the TechNet call The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings who sponsored a tough privacy bill in the th Congress fueled speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved Expectations for action in had dimmed over the past six months as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill But several hightech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed personal interest in protecting consumers privacy and could become more aggressive on the issue Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher priorities such as transportation and television violence A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling his priorities Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz have reintroduced the privacy bills they sponsored in the th Congress TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the organizations members are working on opening a dialogue with Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee is expected to consider She also said TechNet had been planning to develop privacy principles Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be developing the groups privacy principles She also would not comment on what direction the group might pursue The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to take on privacy with some companies and associations taking a stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others advocating a freemarket approach to determining a solution to privacy protection Meanwhile the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an agreement on committee assignments Hollings is officially the chairman but any freshman members such as Sen George Allen RVa currently have no seats on Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is based on the organizational structure adopted for the th Congress By Bara Vaida AGRICULTURE Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs Representatives of agricultural conservation wildlife and industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday when they testified before the House Agriculture Conservation Credit Rural Development and Research Subcommittee Craig Cox executive vice president of the Soil and Water Conservation Society called for doubling the Agriculture Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting a new billion stewardshipbased farm and ranch program to pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation practices If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued Cox said farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm program Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program The increased spending would require a dramatically expanded Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide technical services he said A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze the stewardship contracts farmers would have to take out with the government to get the money Cox said Cox said the societys proposal based on two years of interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in agriculture would be available to farmers throughout the country unlike the current commodity programs which concentrate assistance in the Plains and the South The proposal envisions largescale assistance to ranchers with grazing land and to growers of specialty crops Asked his views on limits to conservation payments Cox said he believes the money should go those who deliver environmental goods and services to the taxpayer The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture testified in favor of block grants to state governments to develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state Wildlife groups asked for an expansion of the landidling Conservation Reserve Program to million acres But the National Grain and Feed Association which represents agricultural suppliers said the CRP should not be expanded beyond the current million acres After the hearing Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas ROkla said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be costly The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority of groups asked for in the commodity title plus what most groups have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the entire farm bill Lucas said That is why I want to focus on what is working and what is not working what is being done efficiently and effectively and what is not By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Dorgan Democrats Will Rule Senate With A Different Tone Democrats will seek to promote a different tone and a different style as the majority party although the new political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda and relationships that shape the Capitol according to Sen Byron Dorgan DND The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to what we have to do in the next few weeks Dorgan who cochairs the Democratic Policy Committee said Wednesday during a wide ranging interview with CongressDaily Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation the Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY appropriations bills On energy issues a top Bush administration priority Dorgan said the presidents plan is not a balanced plan He said the Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that is much more significant than any of us thought Dorgan who met with newly installed Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday said Democratic legislation would focus on production conservation renewable energy and efficiency of appliances Emphasizing an area of agreement with the White House he said there were opportunities to join on incentives to encourage production My hope is we dont debate the production issue over ANWR he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to encourage conservationbut did not say how they would offset costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include Democrats and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit the trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today The budget is passed The tax cut is passed That largely settled those fiscal policy issues for the year Dorgan said Dorgan who will chair the Senate TreasuryPostal Appropriations Subcommittee predicted little change at the Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell RColo Dorgan noted that most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way and anticipated little change in the panels spending priorities under his chairmanship The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the same time they are trying to move the two largest spending billsDefense and LaborHHS With little room to maneuver Congress might again be forced to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from busting the budget or round up the votes needed in the Senate to raise the caps The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly billion FY supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week With only million in offsets the supplemental uses up nearly the entire billion by which Congress raised the FY in the budget resolution Any more spending added to the supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an emergency But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend beyond the percent increase for FY the administration has called for Otherwise be prepared for presidential vetoes Daniels warned this week In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other appropriators Dorgan said Mitch Daniels is sounding his political horn these days I would sooner he just get down to business and work with us and back off the politics just a little bit Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how the year would unfold although he reflected on several new trends Majority Leader Daschle will play a much more pivotal role in national politics now than he did as minority leader he said Dorgan said Vermont Sen James Jeffords switch to independent status is not likely to be repeated in this Congress by other senators A close confidant of the new leader Dorgan praised Daschle for his decentralized leadership style He brings people in He meets He has the patience of Job declared Dorgan Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair will switch from playing occasional defense to developing more of an issues agenda Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic amendments when Republicans were in the majority Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having absolute control on the floor of issues he said adding that Democratic leaders have discussed how they will operate differently I suspect you will see legislation coming to the floor of the Senate without the restrictions Senator Lott imposed Dorgan said Dorgan acknowledged that Democrats had to try to accommodate Republicans because they hold such a narrow majority Theres certainly a danger of high expectations he said Nothing much has changed except the majority leader and the committee chairs The Republicans learned and we understand that its not easy to get things done in a Senate thats evenly split By Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso SENATE LEADERSHIP Organizing Talks Continue Daschle Asks MondayFriday Schedule A team of five Republican senators met for a second time Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Daschle to negotiate a new organizing resolution to reflect Democratic control of the Senateand for the second straight day the two sides described productive and cordial talks but reported no final agreement We had a good meeting and thats all I can say Daschle said late Wednesday Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said the negotiating team had another good productive meeting with Daschle adding I believe were making progress Everybody wants to solve this thingI think we pretty well have done what we want to do Moderate GOP Sen Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he believed some reality has set in among his Republican colleagues many of whom were urging a hard line in the negotiations earlier this week There were a lot less aggressive tones today in a meeting of the GOP Conference than even back in January when the power sharing agreement was negotiated for a Senate And it was a much more logical conversation than earlier in the week he said There wasnt much of a moderateconservative split in there One change will soon become evident in the Senate Daschle said the chamber would begin working on a MondaythroughFriday schedule Throughout the day Wednesday Republicans continued to raise the issue of judicial and other nominees although the demand for written assurances that such nominations would receive a floor vote seemed to recede as the day progressed Still Sen Rick Santorum RPa said there was broad concern within the GOP Conference that members of the new majority have made statements that would change the precedent on nominees Santorum said he had never called for a rules change to address the issue but said he was concerned by comments he attributed to Judiciary Chairman Leahy that nominees can be disqualified simply because they are conservatives We need to confirm with the Democratic side that there will be no break with precedent he said But Santorum agreed that the operating resolution should be resolved within another day or so Sen Edward Kennedy DMass a senior member of the Judiciary Committee was dismissive of the idea that Bush administration nominees should receive any special consideration Bill Lan Lee is my answer to that he said in reference to a Clinton administration Justice Department nomination that Republicans refused to bring forward for a vote We will hear from the Justice Department on judicial nominees and we will have full and fair hearings But there is no presumption to be on the Supreme Court GOP Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho said one of the options Republicans were discussing was dealing with their concerns about nominations for the record either through a dialogue on the Senate floor or through some other type of understanding He predicted that negotiations could be completed today although he said his guess was it would not be voted on until next week The option is to take the appropriate time Craig said Craig agreed with statements by Daschle that the two parties might try to reach an understanding that if Republicans were to regain control the now defunct power sharing resolution would again take effect Thats probably fairly close said Craig who also seemed to indicate that Democrats had reacted favorably to some GOP suggestions Weve asked for several things that they think are fair that we think are fair But he also acknowledged that as the minority party Republicans had limited tools at their disposal We cannot scalp Pat Leahy he said of the Judiciary Committee chairman By Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle POLITICS Morella Declines Governor Bid Focus Shifts To Ehrlich Rep Constance Morella RMd disclosed Tuesday that she would not run for governor in while all but saying that she will seek reelection to a ninth term the Baltimore Sun reported My concentration has always been in my district I like where I am said Morella who was first elected in to her Montgomery Countybased seat The decision turns the statewide spotlight on GOP Rep Robert Ehrlich who plans to make an announcement this summer on whether he will seek the governors office But pollster Keith Haller said Morellas announcement is a big setback for the Maryland Republican Partybecause polls showed her to be a formidable statewide candidate and because Democrats would have a hard time as portraying the politically moderate Morella as out of the mainstream Ehrlich as regarded as more conservative But Haller added Ehrlich now has a wideopen opportunity to assume the Republican mantle should he believe its politically feasible The leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt Gov Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Sen Robert Kennedy DNY Even though she has taken herself out of contention for governor Morella may still face a member of the Kennedy dynasty next year state Del Mark Shriver son of Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver has announced he will seek Morellas House seat POLITICS Davis Appeals To GOP Lawmakers For Donations To Forbes National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia appealed to GOP House members Wednesday for donations to the congressional bid of state Sen Randy Forbes in a forthcoming Virginia special election Davis noted that GOP members have already contributed to the Forbes campaign and urged the remaining GOP Conference members to pony up as well Forbes is running against Democratic state Sen Louise Lucas in the June special election for the th District seat of the late Democratic Rep Norman Sisisky The politically marginal district stretches across southern Virginia from the Richmond area to Portsmouth A NRCC spokesman confirmed

campaign of Sen Harry Reid DNev in which he defeated nowGOP Sen John Ensign by a mere votes COLUMN ON THE MONEY A Train Wreck Wrecker When you ask most people how this years appropriations season will go they let out a groan reminiscent of Lurch on The Addams Family But not Mitch Daniels The OMB director still thinks everything may turn out OKalthough he is a little less optimistic now that the Democrats have taken over the Senate Were very serious about this being an orderly process Daniels said in an interview this week Asked if the process can be smooth Daniels said Well find out But he also said Im confident we were on our way to that and Im confident we can still do it He conceded that working with Democrats leading the Senate may be different from working with the Republicans but said Well have to be flexible where we can be For the past few years of the Clinton administration thenOMB Director Lew started the season with a speech in which he projected gloom and doom The budget resolution contained false numbersThey were too lowNobody believed that was the amount the government really would spendWe would end up in a budget confrontation at the end of the fiscal year and the confrontation would drag into November or later Many predict the same endgame this year They contend education defense and other priorities will exceed the budget resolution and the spending caps will be increased Daniels is making it clear that that is not acceptable Rather than start with a speech he opened the appropriations season with an oped piece in the Washington Post in which he emphasized that the administration wants to stick with this years budget resolution In this weeks interview Daniels said he is trying to change the way OMB interacts with Congress to try to convince members Republicans used to complain that OMB only entered the appropriations process at the endwhen the president threatened a veto and the endgame negotiations had to begin Daniels said OMB is trying to work with Congress at the start of the process Asked when his office became involved he commented Have been are will be OMB officials already have met with appropriations subcommittee staff and will continue to do so throughout the process Daniels said The new strategy was a careful calculation he said As a former Senate staffer he certainly realizes that members carefully protect their prerogatives And he kept saying OMB would be only as involved as appropriators want them to be But having said that Daniels added From the beginning it seemed clear to me that we wanted to be in body contact with the appropriators all the way and we have been However he is not sure how the appropriations dynamic changes with changeover in the Senate This moves the needle a little bit but not far As Republicans have been fond of pointing out the membership of the Senate has not changed But of course being bipartisan means swallowing hard sometimes and being willing to compromiseeven on pork barrel projects a particular target of the administration President Bush has made it clear he wants to cut down on earmarked projects In the supplemental spending bill sent to Congress this month Bush proposed to rescind some million earmarked last year for I in Arkansasmoney put in the Transportation bill to try to help the unsuccessful reelection campaign of former appropriator Rep Jay Dickey RArk The proposed rescission has been criticizedand clearly is a sign that Bush is targeting such projects Even so Daniels said the administration realizes it is going to have to be somewhat pragmatic We called a lot of attention to the sixfold explosion of earmarks which is a distinctly bipartisan phenomenon Daniels said But he quickly added We do think this trend ought to be reined in but were realistic To the extent that this is a lubricant to the process or a bipartisan process we recognize that a lot of it will go on Although Democrats have repeatedly criticized this years budget process Daniels believes it worked fine But Bush has proposed a series of budget reformsranging from a twoyear budget cycle to an automatic continuing resolution that would go into effect if Congress did not complete the annual funding bills by the end of the year Daniels said that reform of the CR process would be a good place to start Appropriators have said they believe an automatic CR takes away all of the incentive to complete the individual bills The administration believes just the opposite The president interprets it as a way to move the process to conclusion to avoid endofsession chaos said Daniels And of course endofsession chaos is something everyone especially the presidentwould like to avoid By David Baumann COLUMN HOUSE RACE HOTLINE A Very Special Time Of Year hardly has been an off year in the House with a total of six special elections slatedand its only June However unlike in most presidential inaugural years just one of the six special elections resulted from a job offer with the administration The remaining special elections resulted from two resignationsboth by members of the presidents partyand three deaths As expected former state Sen Diane Watson won Tuesdays special election in Californias heavily Democratic nd District That race along with last months special election in Pennsylvanias heavily Republican th District set the pattern for the majority of special elections They hold heavily competitive primariesor district conventionswith the eventual winner cruising to victory in the special general election The exception to that rule is in Virginias th District which is known as the only game in the country The race to replace the late Democratic Rep Norman Sisisky matches two state senators in a district that President Bush carried by just votes last November While pressure to hold the seat lies with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the Republicans boast a home field advantage with fellow Virginia Rep Tom Davis at the helm of the National Republican Congressional Committee and Gov James Gilmore leading the Republican National Committee Voters will head to the polls June Here is your primer on the remaining primarytowatch specials Massachusetts In February the late Democratic Rep Joe Moakley announced he would not run for reelection in due to incurable leukemia so potential candidates had been jockeying for his seat well before his death on Memorial Day The current frontrunnerat least in the mediais Max Kennedy one of the younger sons of the late Sen Robert Kennedy DNY But the frontrunner title is very tenuous The Kennedy clan publicly expressed concern about Maxs bid after early missteps Early speculation circulated that Kennedys chief competitor state Sen Stephen Lynch would run as an independent to avoid a crowded Democratic primary that would give Kennedy an advantage Then he would take on Kennedy oneonone Some observers believe that if a Kennedy is beatable it would be in a special election primary held this yearnot in a regular primary held months from now Acting GOP Gov Jane Swift has yet to announce a special election Arkansas Originally the race to replace GOP Rep Asa Hutchinson Bushs appointment to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration was set up to be a race between two of Arkansas political familiesthe Hutchinsons and the Huckabees However not one but two of GOP Gov Mike Huckabees candidates have dropped out Meanwhile Hutchinsons nephew former state Rep Jim Hendren dropped out only to decide the next day that he was back in When the seat opened up a member of another political family state Sen Gunner DeLay said he would defer to Hendren However after Hendrens indecision House Majority Whip DeLays cousin moved ahead with plans to run While this is a solidly Republican seatthenPresident Clinton couldnt even carry his hometown district in a number of Democrats are considering bids because in a special you just never know The date of this special election has not been set yet since Hutchinson is not resigning from the seat until he is confirmed by the Senate Florida After a fake retirement announcement was the subject of a radio stations April Fool gag GOP Rep Joe Scarborough fooled us all in late May by announcing he would resign in September Scarborough took the seat from Democrats in GOP landslide and Republicans are heavily favored to hold this district In fact the chief of staff to former Democratic Rep Earl Hutto is running as a Republican To date things appear to be in a minor mess as no fewer than candidates are currently looking at the raceincluding a father and a son running against each other GOP Gov Jeb Bush has set a special election for October with the primary July and a runoff Sept Meanwhile in Ohios th District talk is already swirling about a potential special election if indicted Democratic Rep James Traficant is convicted The Warren TribuneChronicle speculated that after the case goes to trial next February the state might be able to fit either the primary for the special election or the special election itself on May which would coincide with the regular primary for Congress Add the fact that redistricting would have two different sets of voters in Ohios th District and this special election could be the most specialor at least most interestingof them all By Charles Todd and Maureen Hurley Schweers ENVIRONMENT Administration Will Address Global Warming Rice Says White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice indicated Wednesday that the administration will advance ideas about global warming before President Bush leaves for Europe next week but she was unclear about whether Bush himself will speak on the issue as many expect Rice said Bush would be ready to share what weve learned thus far with the allies during his trip Rice who briefed reporters on the trip agenda said the Cabinetlevel group mulling the issue has not determined what it will tell the president before he embarks But she indicated that whatever information it gives Bush the group will not issue final recommendations before he meets with European leaders who have criticized his decision to scrap the Kyoto treaty Rice confirmed that Bush believes global warming is taking place but added that the advisory groupwhich includes EPA Administrator Whitman Energy Secretary Abraham Treasury Secretary ONeill Interior Secretary Norton and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Lindseyis trying to understand better what we dont know Rice said the panel is exploring the evidence that sequestrationthe removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plant lifecan play a role in dealing with emissionsamong other proposals POLITICS Moderate Republicans Help Dems Win First Senate Vote Moderate Republicans helped Senate Democrats win their first vote since Democrats took control of the chamber Wednesday on an amendment sponsored by Sen Paul Wellstone DMinn to the education bill It requires states to develop quality peer reviewed tests before receiving grants But Democrats may face a more difficult challenge today Wellstone along with Sen Christopher Dodd DConn is planning to offer an amendment to prevent states from being required to comply with President Bushs plan to test every child in grades unless the federal government fully funds Title I Title I provides funds to educate poor and disadvantaged students and Democrats have argued that traditionally it has been underfunded Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy who is managing the bill on the floor will oppose the socalled trigger amendment because it would undercut the bill a spokesman said Senator Kennedy shares Sen Wellstones concern However efforts to secure additional funding should not set back the efforts to put into place the quality assessments said a spokesman TRADE Bush Orders Permits For Firms To Truck International Cargo President Bush ordered Wednesday that US businesses owned by Mexican citizens be permitted to truck international cargo between points within the United States The order in a memorandum to Transportation Secretary Mineta that will be published in the Federal Register implements a portion of a NAFTA arbitration panel decision against US treatment of Mexican trucking firms The order does not affect the right of Mexican trucks to enter the United States a portion of the decision that has not yet been implemented Under Wednesdays order Mexicanowned enterprises also will be allowed to provide bus service within the United States Bush directed

FY While essentially in line with President Bushs requests they differ in some cases by billions of dollars In allocations being released today House appropriators are recommending billion more than Bush wanted for LaborHHS billion more for VAHUD and billion more for Energy and Water The socalled b allocations which the Appropriations Committee should mark up by next week divide the billion set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary appropriations among the Appropriations subcommittees The proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in April however were based on his request that total FY spending be kept to billion The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee All numbers are expressed in budget authority followed by the Bush administration proposal Agriculture billion compared to the Bush proposal of billion CommerceJusticeState billion compared to billion Defense billion billion District of Columbia million million Energy and Water billion billion Foreign Operations billion the same as Bush proposed Interior billion billion LaborHHS billion billion Legislative Branch billion billion Military Construction billion billion Transportation billion billion TreasuryPostal billion billion VAHUD billion billion Meanwhile on the FY front House Appropriations Chairman Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Lewis RCalif both said Thursday that they intend to stick to the presidents supplemental appropriations recommendation despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush administrations nearly billion FY supplemental spending request shortchanges the military The supplemental would provide a total of billion for defense partially offset by million in defense cuts House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman Curt Weldon RPa called the request totally inadequate saying the needs are at least billion Congress ought to provide more money using an emergency designation he said But constrained by the budget caps and the administrations admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the presidents requested level Weve got to be in the real world said Lewis The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but not counted against the cap Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as early as next week and conference with the Senate by July th Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo one of the administrations allies on the Hill said the president would be eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto The president wont be hesitant to veto an early bill Blunt said I think theyre looking for an early opportunity to show their commitment to discipline on spending I wouldnt be at all surprised if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental to see a veto In the Senate where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens RAlaska a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would stick with the presidents overall number on the supplemental Daniels who has insisted that the FY supplemental be kept to true currentyear needs and stay within the budget caps defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress I think Congress is going to see that these items are about the right ones Daniels said By Lisa Caruso HOUSE LEADERSHIP Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House Despite Minority Leader Gephardts plea this week for a new era of bipartisan collaboration the Democratic takeover of the Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in the House according to House Republican leaders with close ties to the Bush White House In fact one key leader House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo said House Republicans feel liberated to pass legislation more to their liking Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased opportunity to get our work done without having to give overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate Blunt said Not that we wont be considerate but there wont be overwhelming consideration Previously we held back on some things in consideration of Senator Lotts challenges Blunt who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans and the White House said he expected the House to pass an energy bill a prescription drug benefit a campaign finance reform measureand perhaps legislation to make permanent this years package of tax cutsall before the August recess These will all be placed on Mr Daschles desk before we go home for the August break Blunt said suggesting the pressure will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with bills backed by the House and President Bush House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the balance of the year in an interview Thursdaymentioning energy prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a patients bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade negotiating authority as top priorities He also spoke favorably about a costofliving increase for members of Congress a subject he discussed earlier in the day with Gephardt Lawmakers ought to be able to keep up with the cost of living so that they can take care of their families and provide for their families like everybody else does Hastert said I think thats the decent thing to do Rep Rob Portman ROhio who chairs House GOP leadership meetings told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference since Sen James Jeffords IVt decided last month to bolt the Republican Party was a little more sensitivity by the White House and our leadership in reaching out to moderatesWhere you might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings Gephardt said this week that Jeffords move could embolden GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats But Portman who served in the administration of Bushs father and has strong ties to the current White House noted that moderate GOP Rep Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the elected leadership as Conference secretary And Rep Doug Ose RCalif serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP leadership Weve already formalized something that the Senate Republicans are just now formalizing Portman said in reference to the appointment of Sen Arlen Specter RPa as the moderates representative within leadership Portman did not indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership was imminent In the two weeks since Jeffords switch House Republican moderates have praised Hasterts leadership of and played down any tensions within their Conference Rep Michael Castle RDel for example said he thought the Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength as a master of compromisebut in the meantime expressed confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was Our views are being taken into consideration Blunt said pointing to efforts by Reps Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut among others to persuade Jeffords to stay put Gephardt this week said he stood with olive branches in both hands but that the House Republican leadership has stiffarmed Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels Civility has been improved but we havent had real bipartisanship Gephardt told reporters House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those olive branches but they did make clear that they have a different definition of bipartisanship Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the first six months of said one White House aide who noted that Karl Rove Bushs top political adviser has been keeping score of all the meetings with Democrats Clintons numbers of meetings with Republicans just pale in comparisonWe did a lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and well just keep on doing it Portman said I dont buy Gephardts premise The two most important bills education and taxes were not rammed through on partyline votes But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative House Democrats reiterated that groups complaint that Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development of legislation The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy A House Democratic leadership source said Its been clear for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed any interest in bipartisan cooperation It may take them awhile to come around The source said the problem extended to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue as well declaring The president has given Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames and hes given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice Department By Charlie Mitchell HOUSE RACES Largent Will Resign From House Calls For Early Special Election Setting the stage for the Houses seventh special election this year Republican Rep Steve Largent announced Thursday that he will resign his Tulsabased st District seat in November to concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a fulltime endeavor in the months ahead Largent said Therefore today I announce my plan to resign on Nov exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov Frank Keating to pass a law in the Legislatures upcoming special session to schedule a special election before Largents effective resignation date I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them to allow the election to take place prior to my actual resignation as was done in with former Democratic Sen David Borens departure from the US Senate Largent said This action would ensure that the st District is never without representation in Washington Largent said Largent formerly a recordsetting wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks entered the House when GOP Sen James Inhofe resigned the House seat to assume Borens Senate seat During his tenure Largent has earned a reputation as a champion of Christian conservative causes He has occasionally bucked his partys leadership and supported the coup attempt against former House Speaker Gingrich He unsuccessfully challenged House Majority Leader Armey in In his resignation announcement Largent said he would remain neutral in the GOP primary which already has grown contentious in anticipation of Largents gubernatorial run The Republican field for Largents seat includes state Rep John Sullivan state Sen Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady Cathy Keating the wife of the Republican governor whose term is up in National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia Thursday called the seat strongly Republican noting that Largent never had received less than percent of the vote in the district Nonetheless at least two Democrats have considered entering the race Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely Democratic nominee while former Tulsa County Democratic Party leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats they can win the seat but he was confident about the prospects That seat is competitive for Democrats Parmley said Make no mistake about it During the th Congress the deaths of Reps Julian Dixon DCalif Norman Sisisky DVa and Joe Moakley DMass have necessitated special elections Largent joins former Rep Bud Shuster RPa and Rep Joe Scarborough RFla in retirement announcements Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk also is expected to resign his seat to accept a position in the Bush administration see related article below By Mark Wegner JUDICIARY Hutchinsons Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation The impending departure of Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk whose nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is expected to be confirmed by the Senate has left the business community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive bill to limit legal liability for business Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Wholesalers It would cap punitive damages for small businesses and for product sellers Introduced last month the bill restricts punitive damages against businesses with fewer than employees and limits awards to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or whichever is less Sens Joseph Lieberman DConn and Mitch McConnell RKy are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate However the loss of Hutchinson a highprofile member of the House Judiciary Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform is a blow for bill proponents observers said this week And the loss is even more significant they say given the shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications for legal reform legislation in general The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most viable of the pending legal reform measureson product liability and class action reformwas considered daunting in a closely divided Senate But with Democrats controlling the agenda numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly impossible At the same time some observers noted the bipartisan appeal of the small business communitycombined with President Bushs expected effort later in his term to advance his civiljustice reform agendacould help move the ball on some piecemeal reforms This is not the first time this year that supporters of product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional sponsors The legislations sponsors in the past Congress included former Rep James Rogan RCalif and former Sens John Ashcroft RMo and Spencer Abraham RMich all of whom lost their reelection bids By Pamela Barnett LABOR GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums Dems Seek New Rule House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood R Ga praised Labor Secretary Chaos decision to hold three public forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by September We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing their jobs or placing Americas economy in an illconceived regulatory straightjacket they said in a joint statement We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important issue moving forward and resolved Chao said Thursday But Democrats were more circumspect We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination thats what we want to avoid said John Lawrence minority staff director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee If its the first step to getting to a rule then we welcome it Ranking member George Miller DCalif and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass sent a letter to Chao in April urging her to issue a new rule But Chao has not committed herself to doing so After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton administration ergonomics rules which would have required employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced problems such as repetitivestress disorders Chao promised to review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be based on are prevention sound science incentivedriven flexibility feasibility and clarity A strong advocate of the Clinton rule the AFLCIO is analyzing the recent announcement and will respond in the very near future said Jay Power the unions legislative representative Manufacturers who opposed the Clinton rule have said in the past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the issue The forums will be held in Washington July Illinois July and California July By April Fulton HEALTH FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another attempt to relax a law that bars the reimportation of US made prescription drugs federal officials told a House Commerce subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the publics safety We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing FDAregulated products for personal use enter the US each year through international mail facilities that Customs could set aside for FDA review for possible violations of law FDA Senior Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect Hubbard testified the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to their addresses despite potential risks Hubbards testimony included the agencys strongest language yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase prescription drugs from overseas Such drugs he said may be contaminated subpotent superpotent or counterfeit FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved products are effective or safe or have been produced under US good manufacturing practices he testified USmade drugs that are reimported may not have been stored under proper conditions or may not be the real product because the United States does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies In a pilot project in California earlier this year FDA examined approximately of some packages flagged as suspicious by Customs officials Hubbard testified that some of those packages contained drugs that could not be identified drugs with labeling only in foreign languages and drugs that have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States by the FDA Several shipments contained three drugs that were once approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on serious safety concerns he testified Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in their outrage over the situation For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet said Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood RPa Their motto might very well be theres a sucker logging on every minute Last month Greenwood subcommittee ranking member Peter Deutsch DFla and Rep Bart Stupak DMich toured the international mail facility at Dulles Airport and what we found was truly frightening Greenwood said including pills hidden in carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to the law making reimportation illegal said the new information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather than loosened But while Dingell called last years legislative attempt to overturn the law a misguided effort to attempt to lower prices by opening up our borders he said Congress must recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because they cannot afford to buy them in the United States By Julie Rovner HEALTH Bilirakis Panel OpenMinded On Addressing Generic Drug Law Although some members of Congress and the brandname pharmaceutical companies are skeptical the House Energy and Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting as a way to save money We do feel we should learn enough about them the generic drug issues thats why were having the hearing next week said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Bilirakis RFla The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan in the next few days following the hearing he said Were trying to stay openminded Bilirakis said But Rep Henry Waxman DCalif said he worries about opening up the drug patent law he wrote with Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah particularly in the context of a broader Medicare prescription drug bill Its not a natural fit Waxman said However Waxman said the law might have some problems that should be addressed These include a month stay that prevents generic products from coming to market if a brandname company claims a patent infringement and the day period during which the first producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from competing with it Hatch and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass now the chairman of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee where the issue could pop up on the Senate side have expressed reservations about opening the bill in the past The brandname drug industry has not shown much interest in revamping the HatchWaxman law but the generic drug companies argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through patent challenges But brandname advocates are bracing for a fight against any such move A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said it would only jeopardize prescription drug coverage for seniors Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio recently introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved with Democratic control of the Senate but Senate aides said no official discussions have taken place since the changeover By April Fulton TRADE EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe US Unilateralism Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday that President Bushs decision to launch a Section investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next weeks EUUS summit Eliasson said the steel decision would be troublesome to a planned discussion on how the worlds two largest trading partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round Eliasson who represents all EU member countries while Sweden holds the groups presidency for the six months ending June spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in advance of the summit in Gothenberg Sweden Eliasson also said that developing a joint EUUS statement on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving to be the most difficult aspect of presummit negotiations Eliasson said the Europeans see no alternative to continuing the Kyoto Protocol talks which Bush has rejected Eliasson also said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg Lamy who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill told an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon We in Europe do not accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the steel problem The European Union he noted has cut million tons of capacity and eliminated jobs in the steel industry without introducing import restrictions Lamy said it would serve a purpose to get the facts of this troubled world industry out into the open The European Union had proposed to the United States that the fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation Lamy said but never received a reply to its suggestion Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade talks Lamy said If at the end of the day the European steelworkers have to pay this way Im not sure the new round will be very popular in Europe Lamy also said the Europeans are becoming concerned about what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic toward unilateralism Responding to speculation that the United States and the European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about launching a new round Lamy said that would be premature Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss foreign policy in the western Balkans the Middle East and Russia the Korean Peninsula the spread of HIV in Africa and the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate will take up President Bushs nominees quickly But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said Thursday that Republicans were delivering to Daschle a GOPdrafted document dealing with Bush nominations Senators said the document would be the basis for some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal statement about nominees Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the statement the general concepts have been negotiated during two meetings between Daschle and a fivemember GOP negotiating team The concepts that weve discussed with Daschle were not turned down said Sen Pete Domenici RNM Domenici said the two sides were getting close and the GOP proposal was trying to reflect the views of all of the senators that we talked to A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new organizing resolution Tuesday That would provide time for the two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference which meet separately Tuesday Both sides said the process has gone smoothly a reflection of a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement of nominees By Geoff Earle POLITICS Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a sixyear term as head of the Social Security Administrationwhich pumps out billion a year to million mainly elderly pension recipients Barnharts appointment as Social Security commissioner is subject to Senate confirmation The commissioners job is always a sensitive position because of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go out on time and keep the records straight But with the president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible battle over his plan to introduce personal stockmarket accounts to the system the job could be even tougher than normal Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs with strong links to exSen William Roth RDel She was a legislative assistant to Roth from and ran his re election campaigns in and She served as political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the cycle Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal government Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for children and families Barnhart is currently a member of the Social Security Advisory Board which advises the president Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income POLITICS Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical sampling Board member David Murray questioned the poststrata adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how many people live in a specific geographical area Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the use of census data Murray said Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nations population and using the common characteristics of people in one area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other similar census blocks Board cochairman Mark Neuman called the census the most accurate census in history and said Census Bureau experts were right to recommend against releasing sampling data for congressional redistricting Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data a special bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled data concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more accurate than traditional data Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that with more time statisticians might be able to validate the sampling data TRANSPORTATION Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla has scheduled a June hearing to give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the airlines are making in improving customer service The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to improve service along with an agreement to make these service commitments legally enforceable by including them in customer contracts The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved legislation earlier this year granting airlines limited antitrust immunity to discuss and coordinate flight schedules Mica said he expected a floor vote during the week of July The House Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill but the referral expires July POLITICS GOP Lawmakers Introduce Legislation On Monuments House Resources Chairman Hansen and nine other lawmakers announced the filing of the National Monument Fairness Act Thursday The American people deserve a voice in how their own public lands are managed said Hansen The bill gives them that voice Under this bill when a president creates a monument larger than acres he must solicit input from the public and the affected governor and congressional delegation The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the monument After that time if Congress has not approved the measure the presidents proclamation sunsets This means people who dont want a big monument in their state can talk to their local leaders their governor or their congressional delegation said Hansen At a news conference Hansen was joined by an original sponsor

changing political dynamics in the Senatecoupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug costsmay soon mean a renewed effort on the issue The House Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug bill it is drafting several key sources said The idea would be to save the government money by removing some barriers faced by generic copies of brandname drugs when they are ready to go to market sources said But any changes to the HatchWaxman lawnamed for its sponsors Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah and Rep Henry Waxman D Califcould open up a multitude of other drug patent issues that have bogged down reform for years That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between one bill or the other said a prescription drug industry source The brandname drug industry so far has been reluctant to back efforts to change the HatchWaxman law But the generic drug industry said it would welcome the change If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit it makes great sense to enact a generic drug bill said a lobbyist for the generic drug industry Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and by Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio could save as much as billion sponsors estimate CBO has yet to score them But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug companies say they could be forced to make The researchbased pharmaceutical industry estimates that it will spend about billion on research and development this year compared with billion in The industry says it develops about percent of the worlds drugs in the United States The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next Wednesday on generic drugs nonprescription drugs and other issues But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much into the scheduling of the hearing In noticing the hearing no one should try to read between the lines the spokesman said Right now were looking at a wide range of options In the end our goal is to address the issue of escalating prices without harming research and innovation HatchWaxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to Democratic control in the Senate While aides said no official discussions have taken place on moving a genericdrug bill since this weeks Democratic takeover members of at least three panelsthe Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee the Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committeehave expressed interest And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman To those who would propose to change the legislation I would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill and caution against making changes that tilt the balance Hatch told a May hearing Yet no law is so perfect that it cannot stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a changing marketplace and society Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill earlier this year that would require genericdrug companies that enter deals with brandname companies to keep their products off the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the Justice Department Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year a spokesman said By April Fulton ENERGY Armey Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican energy policy House Majority Leader Armey and Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahomaboth of whom represent oilrich statesclashed publicly this week on what action Congress should take to address the rising costs and diminishing supplies of the nations energy Responsible for House communications strategy Watts called on House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the volatile prices facing energy consumers this year We need to get answers from energy company executives including producers suppliers refiners transporters distributors and retailers with the goals of finding solutions to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the public Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen Responding to a reporters question Tuesday Armey said he opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of price gouging by the energy industry I would not personally see the need Armey said Why would one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political demagoguery And that is what it is Armey added If people want to look at the companies point their fingers at them thats just nonsense I dont care who it comes from It is just nonsense Without specifically recommending hearings Watts again urged Republican members Wednesday to provide the American people with answers about the current energy crunch saying he favored the measures proposed under President Bushs energy plan While Democrats overstate the role government should play in energy policy Republicans cannot forget that it does have a role Watts wrote in his latest memo While price caps are not an option we must insist on price accountability The Watts memo based on New Models polling data produced by Republican pollster David Winston reflects GOP concerns about the Democratic energy assault Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the party switch of Sen James Jeffords IVt instead of the Republican trillion tax cut It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on Jeffords a Watts aide said To keep the GOP tax relief message alive Watts suggested in his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer From public service announcements to franked mailings the possibilities are endless and Conference is developing a number of resources for you to use Watts wrote In his memo Watts also urged members to redouble their efforts to talk about the passage of education reform There is no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education just because the vote was gaveled he wrote An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between Armey and Watts Its just a question of exploring options the spokesman said By Mark Wegner APPROPRIATIONS Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps Kills School Lunch Program In the first test of FY appropriations spending limits House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans defeated a million proposal Wednesday to continue the international school lunch foodaid program After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla RTexas not to break the caps the subcommittee voted against the amendment sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur DOhio to the FY Agriculture appropriations bill Rep Jo Ann Emerson RMo voted with the Democrats in favor of the proposal Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican subcommittee members nervous Rep James Walsh RNY quickly proposed report language that the subcommittee strongly urges the Agriculture Department to continue the program formally known as the Global Food for Education Initiative Former Sen George McGovern DSD now US ambassador to the world food agencies in Rome and former Senate Majority Leader Dole have promoted it Kaptur asked Walsh to change the strongly urges wording to expects and the report language passed unanimously However after the markup session Kaptur said that she does not know what impact the report language will have She is inclined to re offer the amendment in full committee Bonilla initially suggested the report language but House Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis pressed for the vote saying that if the subcommittee cant get together on food aid to kids who need it he did not know what measures it could agree on The Clinton administration started the international school lunch initiative using its administrative authority to distribute surplus commodities It did not have to be scored in FY subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush administration has not stated a clear position on the school lunch initiative yet They believe a directive from the subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment for next year The subcommittee later approved the bill which provides billion for all programs of which billion is discretionary funding The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs Excluding billion in emergency appropriations in the FY bill it contains a percent increase Kaptur who has had testy relations with Bonilla said the bill was better than we expected By Jerry Hagstrom APPROPRIATIONS Dem Appropriators Criticize Administrations NSF Funding Request A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the administrations request for funding for the National Science Foundation saying it was inadequate to fully support the agencys research efforts and failed to move toward the panels goal of doubling NSF funding over five years National Journals Technology Daily reported I am disappointed in the administrations overall research and development budget and the NSF proposal in particular said Senate VAHUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski DMd This is the first time in the NSFs year history that an administration has requested Congress to cut NSFs research budget below the previous years level The administration requested billion for NSF in FY a million increase or percent which is less than the rate of inflation NSFs budget would have to rise by about million in FY to meet the goal of doubling in five years Mikulski said She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell Is this million increase what you wanted or is this what you got Colwell defended the budget request saying it focuses on areas the administration has identified as priorities such as education and training But she also added that she fully supports the panels efforts to double NSFs budget The NSF proposal calls for an percent increase for education and human resources including million for math and science partnerships and million for a program that puts graduate students in K classrooms The proposal also would increase stipends for graduate fellowships We are losing our best and brightest science students to other fields said Eamon Kelly chairman of the National Science Board who expressed support for the budget proposal Even our future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform their tasks Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of science and math education and worker literacy But she also noted the value of funding basic research in science and technology saying that if NSF had not done the work it began years ago I dont believe wed have the information technology we have today Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSFs support for nanoscale science and engineering research by percent Nanotechnology could change the way almost everything is designed from medicines to computers to automobiles The budget request would increase funding for research and related areas by percent to billion Members of the House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon characterized that funding level as inadequate About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request is that its disappointing said Rep Eddie Bernice Johnson D Texas Testifying at the House hearing NSF Deputy Director Joseph Bordogna said the budgets focus on people was intentional NSF is as much about building a worldclass workforce as it is about discovery he said It is important to emphasize that research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is fundamental to NSFs mission By Robert Lamb APPROPRIATIONS Despite Shrunken Surplus GOP Sees Increased FY Cushion Despite CBOs reduced estimate of next years surplus Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY budget cushion of about billioneven after setting aside the politically untouchable Medicare trustfund surplus GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller thanallowed costs of the FY share of the trillion tax cut The experts explained their estimates of the figures in response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the FY cushion may have sagged to as low as billion based on CBOs revised surplus estimates Democrats meanwhile countered that the tax cut which President Bush plans to sign today relies on an accounting gimmick in FY to make additional money available In FY and beyond this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trustfund surplusdespite language in the budget resolution that bars Congress from doing so In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt DSC planned to release today Democrats charge that the trillion tax cut exhausts the available surplus in through and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and Medicare even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits in the budget resolution The FY budget resolution approved by Congress used CBOs January baseline to project a total FY budget surplus of billion with an onbudget surplus of billion of which billion comes from the Medicare Part A trustfund surplus The remaining billion of the surplus was left as a reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget including the increase in defense spending expected to result from Defense Secretary Rumsfelds strategic review Last week CBO released its analysis of the presidents budget using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the surplus by billion In April CBO recalculated the FY Medicare trust fund at billionor billion larger than estimated in January Taken together CBOs most recent estimates of the total surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of the FY reserve by billion leaving only billion in the reserve The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by billion in FY But the final tax package that Congress enacted as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation carries an FY price tag of just billionmeaning that billion budgeted for but not spent in the tax bill should be included in the available FY surplus CBOs January baseline produced a reserve of nearly billion for FY assuming the tax bill would use up the entire billion provided in the budget Because the tax bill actually cost billion less the reserve instead would amount to about billion using the January surplus estimates Using the less generous May baseline and the morethan billion reserve it produces the unspent portion of the tax bill would take the FY reserve to almost billion In both cases the reserve represents the size of the surplus after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set aside In the analysis being issued today Democrats say the size of the tax cut means that funding priorities like defense modernization a Medicare prescription drug benefit or educationpriorities that even Republicans supportwill require a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes Either the resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social Security and Medicare or funding of other national priorities must be severely cutsimply because the tax cut is too big The Democratic analysis uses CBOs May baseline and includes the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the budget resolution adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation It projects an available surplus outside the Social Security and Medicare trust funds of billion in FY a figure that accounts for billion in debt service costsbut a deficit of billion in FY and a billion deficit in FY As for the FY surplus Democrats counter that Republicans were only able to show a surplus by using a billion accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY to FY As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with the budget resolution a provision delays the deadline for corporate estimatedtax payments from September to October effectively making the billion in estimated revenue available on the first day of FY instead of at the end of FY By Lisa Caruso TRADE AntiNAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be facing this year is the establishment of a freetrade agreement with Chile A group of labor and environmental organizations known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans today to step up lobbying against the deal The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Friends of the Earth along with a number of labor groups from Chile The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with Chile worked out by the end of the year It is expected that such an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free Trade Agreement which many labor environmental and human rights groups charge has adversely affected US jobs and environmental standards in the business corridor along the USMexican border Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade with Chile are Sens Christopher Dodd DConn and Phil Gramm R Texas Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed trade deal sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the bitter NAFTA controversy While significant differences remain between the United States and Chile over the details of the deal the administration has stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a Free Trade Area of Americas and the Chilean pact would help advance that effort In addition such a pact would help Chile play a higher profile role in South American political and economic affairs than its rival Brazil To help bring about the FTAA many observers believe it is essential for the president to have broad presidential trade negotiating authority Formerly known as fast track the proposal is moving up on the congressional agenda House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to see a measure on the floor as soon as July and Senate Finance Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential tradenegotiating authority But Baucus has insisted that labor and environmental matters be taken into account This week the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to Congress members It outlines a spate of bilateral trade agreements in recent yearsoften without US participation and at the expense of the United States To shore up the US role in trade matters the Business Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration calls trade promotion authority as quickly as possible By Stephen Norton TECHNOLOGY HighTech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a higher priority in the chamber members of the Silicon Valley lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the issue National Journals Technology Daily reported In a conference call earlier this week lobbyists for high tech companies including HewlettPackard Cisco Systems Sun Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy principles without advocating or opposing any particular legislation The list then could be used to educate senators on how to view any particular privacy bill Companies are still trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of legislation or not said one person familiar with the TechNet call The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings who sponsored a tough privacy bill in the th Congress fueled speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved Expectations for action in had dimmed over the past six months as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill But several hightech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed personal interest in protecting consumers privacy and could become more aggressive on the issue Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher priorities such as transportation and television violence A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling his priorities Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz have reintroduced the privacy bills they sponsored in the th Congress TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the organizations members are working on opening a dialogue with Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee is expected to consider She also said TechNet had been planning to develop privacy principles Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be developing the groups privacy principles She also would not comment on what direction the group might pursue The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to take on privacy with some companies and associations taking a stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others advocating a freemarket approach to determining a solution to privacy protection Meanwhile the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an agreement on committee assignments Hollings is officially the chairman but any freshman members such as Sen George Allen RVa currently have no seats on Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is based on the organizational structure adopted for the th Congress By Bara Vaida AGRICULTURE Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs Representatives of agricultural conservation wildlife and industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday when they testified before the House Agriculture Conservation Credit Rural Development and Research Subcommittee Craig Cox executive vice president of the Soil and Water Conservation Society called for doubling the Agriculture Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting a new billion stewardshipbased farm and ranch program to pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation practices If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued Cox said farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm program Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program The increased spending would require a dramatically expanded Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide technical services he said A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze the stewardship contracts farmers would have to take out with the government to get the money Cox said Cox said the societys proposal based on two years of interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in agriculture would be available to farmers throughout the country unlike the current commodity programs which concentrate assistance in the Plains and the South The proposal envisions largescale assistance to ranchers with grazing land and to growers of specialty crops Asked his views on limits to conservation payments Cox said he believes the money should go those who deliver environmental goods and services to the taxpayer The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture testified in favor of block grants to state governments to develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state Wildlife groups asked for an expansion of the landidling Conservation Reserve Program to million acres But the National Grain and Feed Association which represents agricultural suppliers said the CRP should not be expanded beyond the current million acres After the hearing Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas ROkla said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be costly The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority of groups asked for in the commodity title plus what most groups have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the entire farm bill Lucas said That is why I want to focus on what is working and what is not working what is being done efficiently and effectively and what is not By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Dorgan Democrats Will Rule Senate With A Different Tone Democrats will seek to promote a different tone and a different style as the majority party although the new political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda and relationships that shape the Capitol according to Sen Byron Dorgan DND The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to what we have to do in the next few weeks Dorgan who cochairs the Democratic Policy Committee said Wednesday during a wide ranging interview with CongressDaily Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation the Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY appropriations bills On energy issues a top Bush administration priority Dorgan said the presidents plan is not a balanced plan He said the Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that is much more significant than any of us thought Dorgan who met with newly installed Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday said Democratic legislation would focus on production conservation renewable energy and efficiency of appliances Emphasizing an area of agreement with the White House he said there were opportunities to join on incentives to encourage production My hope is we dont debate the production issue over ANWR he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to encourage conservationbut did not say how they would offset costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include Democrats and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit the trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today The budget is passed The tax cut is passed That largely settled those fiscal policy issues for the year Dorgan said Dorgan who will chair the Senate TreasuryPostal Appropriations Subcommittee predicted little change at the Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell RColo Dorgan noted that most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way and anticipated little change in the panels spending priorities under his chairmanship The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the same time they are trying to move the two largest spending billsDefense and LaborHHS With little room to maneuver Congress might again be forced to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from busting the budget or round up the votes needed in the Senate to raise the caps The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly billion FY supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week With only million in offsets the supplemental uses up nearly the entire billion by which Congress raised the FY in the budget resolution Any more spending added to the supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an emergency But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend beyond the percent increase for FY the administration has called for Otherwise be prepared for presidential vetoes Daniels warned this week In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other appropriators Dorgan said Mitch Daniels is sounding his political horn these days I would sooner he just get down to business and work with us and back off the politics just a little bit Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how the year would unfold although he reflected on several new trends Majority Leader Daschle will play a much more pivotal role in national politics now than he did as minority leader he said Dorgan said Vermont Sen James Jeffords switch to independent status is not likely to be repeated in this Congress by other senators A close confidant of the new leader Dorgan praised Daschle for his decentralized leadership style He brings people in He meets He has the patience of Job declared Dorgan Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair will switch from playing occasional defense to developing more of an issues agenda Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic amendments when Republicans were in the majority Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having absolute control on the floor of issues he said adding that Democratic leaders have discussed how they will operate differently I suspect you will see legislation coming to the floor of the Senate without the restrictions Senator Lott imposed Dorgan said Dorgan acknowledged that Democrats had to try to accommodate Republicans because they hold such a narrow majority Theres certainly a danger of high expectations he said Nothing much has changed except the majority leader and the committee chairs The Republicans learned and we understand that its not easy to get things done in a Senate thats evenly split By Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso SENATE LEADERSHIP Organizing Talks Continue Daschle Asks MondayFriday Schedule A team of five Republican senators met for a second time Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Daschle to negotiate a new organizing resolution to reflect Democratic control of the Senateand for the second straight day the two sides described productive and cordial talks but reported no final agreement We had a good meeting and thats all I can say Daschle said late Wednesday Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said the negotiating team had another good productive meeting with Daschle adding I believe were making progress Everybody wants to solve this thingI think we pretty well have done what we want to do Moderate GOP Sen Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he believed some reality has set in among his Republican colleagues many of whom were urging a hard line in the negotiations earlier this week There were a lot less aggressive tones today in a meeting of the GOP Conference than even back in January when the power sharing agreement was negotiated for a Senate And it was a much more logical conversation than earlier in the week he said There wasnt much of a moderateconservative split in there One change will soon become evident in the Senate Daschle said the chamber would begin working on a MondaythroughFriday schedule Throughout the day Wednesday Republicans continued to raise the issue of judicial and other nominees although the demand for written assurances that such nominations would receive a floor vote seemed to recede as the day progressed Still Sen Rick Santorum RPa said there was broad concern within the GOP Conference that members of the new majority have made statements that would change the precedent on nominees Santorum said he had never called for a rules change to address the issue but said he was concerned by comments he attributed to Judiciary Chairman Leahy that nominees can be disqualified simply because they are conservatives We need to confirm with the Democratic side that there will be no break with precedent he said But Santorum agreed that the operating resolution should be resolved within another day or so Sen Edward Kennedy DMass a senior member of the Judiciary Committee was dismissive of the idea that Bush administration nominees should receive any special consideration Bill Lan Lee is my answer to that he said in reference to a Clinton administration Justice Department nomination that Republicans refused to bring forward for a vote We will hear from the Justice Department on judicial nominees and we will have full and fair hearings But there is no presumption to be on the Supreme Court GOP Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho said one of the options Republicans were discussing was dealing with their concerns about nominations for the record either through a dialogue on the Senate floor or through some other type of understanding He predicted that negotiations could be completed today although he said his guess was it would not be voted on until next week The option is to take the appropriate time Craig said Craig agreed with statements by Daschle that the two parties might try to reach an understanding that if Republicans were to regain control the now defunct power sharing resolution would again take effect Thats probably fairly close said Craig who also seemed to indicate that Democrats had reacted favorably to some GOP suggestions Weve asked for several things that they think are fair that we think are fair But he also acknowledged that as the minority party Republicans had limited tools at their disposal We cannot scalp Pat Leahy he said of the Judiciary Committee chairman By Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle POLITICS Morella Declines Governor Bid Focus Shifts To Ehrlich Rep Constance Morella RMd disclosed Tuesday that she would not run for governor in while all but saying that she will seek reelection to a ninth term the Baltimore Sun reported My concentration has always been in my district I like where I am said Morella who was first elected in to her Montgomery Countybased seat The decision turns the statewide spotlight on GOP Rep Robert Ehrlich who plans to make an announcement this summer on whether he will seek the governors office But pollster Keith Haller said Morellas announcement is a big setback for the Maryland Republican Partybecause polls showed her to be a formidable statewide candidate and because Democrats would have a hard time as portraying the politically moderate Morella as out of the mainstream Ehrlich as regarded as more conservative But Haller added Ehrlich now has a wideopen opportunity to assume the Republican mantle should he believe its politically feasible The leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt Gov Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Sen Robert Kennedy DNY Even though she has taken herself out of contention for governor Morella may still face a member of the Kennedy dynasty next year state Del Mark Shriver son of Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver has announced he will seek Morellas House seat POLITICS Davis Appeals To GOP Lawmakers For Donations To Forbes National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia appealed to GOP House members Wednesday for donations to the congressional bid of state Sen Randy Forbes in a forthcoming Virginia special election Davis noted that GOP members have already contributed to the Forbes campaign and urged the remaining GOP Conference members to pony up as well Forbes is running against Democratic state Sen Louise Lucas in the June special election for the th District seat of the late Democratic Rep Norman Sisisky The politically marginal district stretches across southern Virginia from the Richmond area to Portsmouth A NRCC spokesman confirmed the Davis request saying Its a close race and we need all the help we can get House Majority Whip DeLay Wednesday also briefed the GOP Conference of his ROMP and STOMP programs ROMPthe Retain Our Majority Programencourages safe incumbents to contribute excess campaign contributions to vulnerable GOP members STOMPthe Strategic Task Force for Organizing and Mobilizing Peopleis designed to build

number of potential candidates Michigan Republicans are continuing their search for a candidate to take on Democratic Sen Carl Levinwho Wednesday assumed the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee with the Senates shift to Democratic control Businessman Jim Nicholson who lost a bid for the GOP nomination against Levin told The Detroit News that it will take brave people to consider going against Levin while adding And I may be one of them Nicholson said he would not decide until late this year Another possible Levin challenger getting high marks from the state GOP headquarters is businessman David Brandon a close ally of GOP Gov John Engler who is a University of Michigan trustee A party spokesman said Brandon is a guy with a good story who would be a good candidate Another close Engler associateDan Pero a former Engler chief of staff who managed two of the governors campaignslast month took himself out of the running POLITICS Backus Moving From DNC To DCCC Jenny Backus says she decided to leave her post as spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee to move to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee because I wanted the opportunity to work directly on House races which are essential DCCC Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York has tapped the veteran political operative to head the committees communications shop for the cycle effective June Backus replaces Erik Smith who left the DCCC recently to serve as communications director for House Minority Leader Gephardt Backus said she will miss working with DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe but added that she wanted more contact with up and coming stars in the Democratic Party and said the new job will help her learn the countrys new redistricting map Before joining the DNC Backus worked on the campaign of Sen Harry Reid DNev in which he defeated nowGOP Sen John Ensign by a mere votes COLUMN ON THE MONEY A Train Wreck Wrecker When you ask most people how this years appropriations season will go they let out a groan reminiscent of Lurch on The Addams Family But not Mitch Daniels The OMB director still thinks everything may turn out OKalthough he is a little less optimistic now that the Democrats have taken over the Senate Were very serious about this being an orderly process Daniels said in an interview this week Asked if the process can be smooth Daniels said Well find out But he also said Im confident we were on our way to that and Im confident we can still do it He conceded that working with Democrats leading the Senate may be different from working with the Republicans but said Well have to be flexible where we can be For the past few years of the Clinton administration thenOMB Director Lew started the season with a speech in which he projected gloom and doom The budget resolution contained false numbersThey were too lowNobody believed that was the amount the government really would spendWe would end up in a budget confrontation at the end of the fiscal year and the confrontation would drag into November or later Many predict the same endgame this year They contend education defense and other priorities will exceed the budget resolution and the spending caps will be increased Daniels is making it clear that that is not acceptable Rather than start with a speech he opened the appropriations season with an oped piece in the Washington Post in which he emphasized that the administration wants to stick with this years budget resolution In this weeks interview Daniels said he is trying to change the way OMB interacts with Congress to try to convince members Republicans used to complain that OMB only entered the appropriations process at the endwhen the president threatened a veto and the endgame negotiations had to begin Daniels said OMB is trying to work with Congress at the start of the process Asked when his office became involved he commented Have been are will be OMB officials already have met with appropriations subcommittee staff and will continue to do so throughout the process Daniels said The new strategy was a careful calculation he said As a former Senate staffer he certainly realizes that members carefully protect their prerogatives And he kept saying OMB would be only as involved as appropriators want them to be But having said that Daniels added From the beginning it seemed clear to me that we wanted to be in body contact with the appropriators all the way and we have been However he is not sure how the appropriations dynamic changes with changeover in the Senate This moves the needle a little bit but not far As Republicans have been fond of pointing out the membership of the Senate has not changed But of course being bipartisan means swallowing hard sometimes and being willing to compromiseeven on pork barrel projects a particular target of the administration President Bush has made it clear he wants to cut down on earmarked projects In the supplemental spending bill sent to Congress this month Bush proposed to rescind some million earmarked last year for I in Arkansasmoney put in the Transportation bill to try to help the unsuccessful reelection campaign of former appropriator Rep Jay Dickey RArk The proposed rescission has been criticizedand clearly is a sign that Bush is targeting such projects Even so Daniels said the administration realizes it is going to have to be somewhat pragmatic We called a lot of attention to the sixfold explosion of earmarks which is a distinctly bipartisan phenomenon Daniels said But he quickly added We do think this trend ought to be reined in but were realistic To the extent that this is a lubricant to the process or a bipartisan process we recognize that a lot of it will go on Although Democrats have repeatedly criticized this years budget process Daniels believes it worked fine But Bush has proposed a series of budget reformsranging from a twoyear budget cycle to an automatic continuing resolution that would go into effect if Congress did not complete the annual funding bills by the end of the year Daniels said that reform of the CR process would be a good place to start Appropriators have said they believe an automatic CR takes away all of the incentive to complete the individual bills The administration believes just the opposite The president interprets it as a way to move the process to conclusion to avoid endofsession chaos said Daniels And of course endofsession chaos is something everyone especially the presidentwould like to avoid By David Baumann COLUMN HOUSE RACE HOTLINE A Very Special Time Of Year hardly has been an off year in the House with a total of six special elections slatedand its only June However unlike in most presidential inaugural years just one of the six special elections resulted from a job offer with the administration The remaining special elections resulted from two resignationsboth by members of the presidents partyand three deaths As expected former state Sen Diane Watson won Tuesdays special election in Californias heavily Democratic nd District That race along with last months special election in Pennsylvanias heavily Republican th District set the pattern for the majority of special elections They hold heavily competitive primariesor district conventionswith the eventual winner cruising to victory in the special general election The exception to that rule is in Virginias th District which is known as the only game in the country The race to replace the late Democratic Rep Norman Sisisky matches two state senators in a district that President Bush carried by just votes last November While pressure to hold the seat lies with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the Republicans boast a home field advantage with fellow Virginia Rep Tom Davis at the helm of the National Republican Congressional Committee and Gov James Gilmore leading the Republican National Committee Voters will head to the polls June Here is your primer on the remaining primarytowatch specials Massachusetts In February the late Democratic Rep Joe Moakley announced he would not run for reelection in due to incurable leukemia so potential candidates had been jockeying for his seat well before his death on Memorial Day The current frontrunnerat least in the mediais Max Kennedy one of the younger sons of the late Sen Robert Kennedy DNY But the frontrunner title is very tenuous The Kennedy clan publicly expressed concern about Maxs bid after early missteps Early speculation circulated that Kennedys chief competitor state Sen Stephen Lynch would run as an independent to avoid a crowded Democratic primary that would give Kennedy an advantage Then he would take on Kennedy oneonone Some observers believe that if a Kennedy is beatable it would be in a special election primary held this yearnot in a regular primary held months from now Acting GOP Gov Jane Swift has yet to announce a special election Arkansas Originally the race to replace GOP Rep Asa Hutchinson Bushs appointment to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration was set up to be a race between two of Arkansas political familiesthe Hutchinsons and the Huckabees However not one but two of GOP Gov Mike Huckabees candidates have dropped out Meanwhile Hutchinsons nephew former state Rep Jim Hendren dropped out only to decide the next day that he was back in When the seat opened up a member of another political family state Sen Gunner DeLay said he would defer to Hendren However after Hendrens indecision House Majority Whip DeLays cousin moved ahead with plans to run While this is a solidly Republican seatthenPresident Clinton couldnt even carry his hometown district in a number of Democrats are considering bids because in a special you just never know The date of this special election has not been set yet since Hutchinson is not resigning from the seat until he is confirmed by the Senate Florida After a fake retirement announcement was the subject of a radio stations April Fool gag GOP Rep Joe Scarborough fooled us all in late May by announcing he would resign in September Scarborough took the seat from Democrats in GOP landslide and Republicans are heavily favored to hold this district In fact the chief of staff to former Democratic Rep Earl Hutto is running as a Republican To date things appear to be in a minor mess as no fewer than candidates are currently looking at the raceincluding a father and a son running against each other GOP Gov Jeb Bush has set a special election for October with the primary July and a runoff Sept Meanwhile in Ohios th District talk is already swirling about a potential special election if indicted Democratic Rep James Traficant is convicted The Warren TribuneChronicle speculated that after the case goes to trial next February the state might be able to fit either the primary for the special election or the special election itself on May which would coincide with the regular primary for Congress Add the fact that redistricting would have two different sets of voters in Ohios th District and this special election could be the most specialor at least most interestingof them all By Charles Todd and Maureen Hurley Schweers ENVIRONMENT Administration Will Address Global Warming Rice Says White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice indicated Wednesday that the administration will advance ideas about global warming before President Bush leaves for Europe next week but she was unclear about whether Bush himself will speak on the issue as many expect Rice said Bush would be ready to share what weve learned thus far with the allies during his trip Rice who briefed reporters on the trip agenda said the Cabinetlevel group mulling the issue has not determined what it will tell the president before he embarks But she indicated that whatever information it gives Bush the group will not issue final recommendations before he meets with European leaders who have criticized his decision to scrap the Kyoto treaty Rice confirmed that Bush believes global warming is taking place but added that the advisory groupwhich includes EPA Administrator Whitman Energy Secretary Abraham Treasury Secretary ONeill Interior Secretary Norton and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Lindseyis trying to understand better what we dont know Rice said the panel is exploring the evidence that sequestrationthe removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plant lifecan play a role in dealing with emissionsamong other proposals POLITICS Moderate Republicans Help Dems Win First Senate Vote Moderate Republicans helped Senate Democrats win their first vote since Democrats took control of the chamber Wednesday on an amendment sponsored by Sen Paul Wellstone DMinn to the education bill It requires states to develop quality peer reviewed tests before receiving grants But Democrats may face a more difficult challenge today Wellstone along with Sen Christopher Dodd DConn is planning to offer an amendment to prevent states from being required to comply with President Bushs plan to test every child in grades unless the federal government fully funds Title I Title I provides funds to educate poor and disadvantaged students and Democrats have argued that traditionally it has been underfunded Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy who is managing the bill on the floor will oppose the socalled trigger amendment because it would undercut the bill a spokesman said Senator Kennedy shares Sen Wellstones concern However efforts to secure additional funding should not set back the efforts to put into place the quality assessments said a spokesman TRADE Bush Orders Permits For Firms To Truck International Cargo President Bush ordered Wednesday that US businesses owned by Mexican citizens be permitted to truck international cargo between points within the United States The order in a memorandum to Transportation Secretary Mineta that will be published in the Federal Register implements a portion of a NAFTA arbitration panel decision against US treatment of Mexican trucking firms The order does not affect the right of Mexican trucks to enter the United

FY While essentially in line with President Bushs requests they differ in some cases by billions of dollars In allocations being released today House appropriators are recommending billion more than Bush wanted for LaborHHS billion more for VAHUD and billion more for Energy and Water The socalled b allocations which the Appropriations Committee should mark up by next week divide the billion set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary appropriations among the Appropriations subcommittees The proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in April however were based on his request that total FY spending be kept to billion The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee All numbers are expressed in budget authority followed by the Bush administration proposal Agriculture billion compared to the Bush proposal of billion CommerceJusticeState billion compared to billion Defense billion billion District of Columbia million million Energy and Water billion billion Foreign Operations billion the same as Bush proposed Interior billion billion LaborHHS billion billion Legislative Branch billion billion Military Construction billion billion Transportation billion billion TreasuryPostal billion billion VAHUD billion billion Meanwhile on the FY front House Appropriations Chairman Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Lewis RCalif both said Thursday that they intend to stick to the presidents supplemental appropriations recommendation despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush administrations nearly billion FY supplemental spending request shortchanges the military The supplemental would provide a total of billion for defense partially offset by million in defense cuts House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman Curt Weldon RPa called the request totally inadequate saying the needs are at least billion Congress ought to provide more money using an emergency designation he said But constrained by the budget caps and the administrations admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the presidents requested level Weve got to be in the real world said Lewis The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but not counted against the cap Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as early as next week and conference with the Senate by July th Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo one of the administrations allies on the Hill said the president would be eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto The president wont be hesitant to veto an early bill Blunt said I think theyre looking for an early opportunity to show their commitment to discipline on spending I wouldnt be at all surprised if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental to see a veto In the Senate where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens RAlaska a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would stick with the presidents overall number on the supplemental Daniels who has insisted that the FY supplemental be kept to true currentyear needs and stay within the budget caps defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress I think Congress is going to see that these items are about the right ones Daniels said By Lisa Caruso HOUSE LEADERSHIP Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House Despite Minority Leader Gephardts plea this week for a new era of bipartisan collaboration the Democratic takeover of the Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in the House according to House Republican leaders with close ties to the Bush White House In fact one key leader House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo said House Republicans feel liberated to pass legislation more to their liking Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased opportunity to get our work done without having to give overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate Blunt said Not that we wont be considerate but there wont be overwhelming consideration Previously we held back on some things in consideration of Senator Lotts challenges Blunt who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans and the White House said he expected the House to pass an energy bill a prescription drug benefit a campaign finance reform measureand perhaps legislation to make permanent this years package of tax cutsall before the August recess These will all be placed on Mr Daschles desk before we go home for the August break Blunt said suggesting the pressure will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with bills backed by the House and President Bush House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the balance of the year in an interview Thursdaymentioning energy prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a patients bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade negotiating authority as top priorities He also spoke favorably about a costofliving increase for members of Congress a subject he discussed earlier in the day with Gephardt Lawmakers ought to be able to keep up with the cost of living so that they can take care of their families and provide for their families like everybody else does Hastert said I think thats the decent thing to do Rep Rob Portman ROhio who chairs House GOP leadership meetings told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference since Sen James Jeffords IVt decided last month to bolt the Republican Party was a little more sensitivity by the White House and our leadership in reaching out to moderatesWhere you might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings Gephardt said this week that Jeffords move could embolden GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats But Portman who served in the administration of Bushs father and has strong ties to the current White House noted that moderate GOP Rep Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the elected leadership as Conference secretary And Rep Doug Ose RCalif serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP leadership Weve already formalized something that the Senate Republicans are just now formalizing Portman said in reference to the appointment of Sen Arlen Specter RPa as the moderates representative within leadership Portman did not indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership was imminent In the two weeks since Jeffords switch House Republican moderates have praised Hasterts leadership of and played down any tensions within their Conference Rep Michael Castle RDel for example said he thought the Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength as a master of compromisebut in the meantime expressed confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was Our views are being taken into consideration Blunt said pointing to efforts by Reps Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut among others to persuade Jeffords to stay put Gephardt this week said he stood with olive branches in both hands but that the House Republican leadership has stiffarmed Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels Civility has been improved but we havent had real bipartisanship Gephardt told reporters House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those olive branches but they did make clear that they have a different definition of bipartisanship Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the first six months of said one White House aide who noted that Karl Rove Bushs top political adviser has been keeping score of all the meetings with Democrats Clintons numbers of meetings with Republicans just pale in comparisonWe did a lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and well just keep on doing it Portman said I dont buy Gephardts premise The two most important bills education and taxes were not rammed through on partyline votes But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative House Democrats reiterated that groups complaint that Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development of legislation The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy A House Democratic leadership source said Its been clear for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed any interest in bipartisan cooperation It may take them awhile to come around The source said the problem extended to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue as well declaring The president has given Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames and hes given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice Department By Charlie Mitchell HOUSE RACES Largent Will Resign From House Calls For Early Special Election Setting the stage for the Houses seventh special election this year Republican Rep Steve Largent announced Thursday that he will resign his Tulsabased st District seat in November to concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a fulltime endeavor in the months ahead Largent said Therefore today I announce my plan to resign on Nov exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov Frank Keating to pass a law in the Legislatures upcoming special session to schedule a special election before Largents effective resignation date I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them to allow the election to take place prior to my actual resignation as was done in with former Democratic Sen David Borens departure from the US Senate Largent said This action would ensure that the st District is never without representation in Washington Largent said Largent formerly a recordsetting wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks entered the House when GOP Sen James Inhofe resigned the House seat to assume Borens Senate seat During his tenure Largent has earned a reputation as a champion of Christian conservative causes He has occasionally bucked his partys leadership and supported the coup attempt against former House Speaker Gingrich He unsuccessfully challenged House Majority Leader Armey in In his resignation announcement Largent said he would remain neutral in the GOP primary which already has grown contentious in anticipation of Largents gubernatorial run The Republican field for Largents seat includes state Rep John Sullivan state Sen Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady Cathy Keating the wife of the Republican governor whose term is up in National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia Thursday called the seat strongly Republican noting that Largent never had received less than percent of the vote in the district Nonetheless at least two Democrats have considered entering the race Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely Democratic nominee while former Tulsa County Democratic Party leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats they can win the seat but he was confident about the prospects That seat is competitive for Democrats Parmley said Make no mistake about it During the th Congress the deaths of Reps Julian Dixon DCalif Norman Sisisky DVa and Joe Moakley DMass have necessitated special elections Largent joins former Rep Bud Shuster RPa and Rep Joe Scarborough RFla in retirement announcements Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk also is expected to resign his seat to accept a position in the Bush administration see related article below By Mark Wegner JUDICIARY Hutchinsons Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation The impending departure of Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk whose nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is expected to be confirmed by the Senate has left the business community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive bill to limit legal liability for business Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Wholesalers It would cap punitive damages for small businesses and for product sellers Introduced last month the bill restricts punitive damages against businesses with fewer than employees and limits awards to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or whichever is less Sens Joseph Lieberman DConn and Mitch McConnell RKy are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate However the loss of Hutchinson a highprofile member of the House Judiciary Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform is a blow for bill proponents observers said this week And the loss is even more significant they say given the shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications for legal reform legislation in general The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most viable of the pending legal reform measureson product liability and class action reformwas considered daunting in a closely divided Senate But with Democrats controlling the agenda numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly impossible At the same time some observers noted the bipartisan appeal of the small business communitycombined with President Bushs expected effort later in his term to advance his civiljustice reform agendacould help move the ball on some piecemeal reforms This is not the first time this year that supporters of product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional sponsors The legislations sponsors in the past Congress included former Rep James Rogan RCalif and former Sens John Ashcroft RMo and Spencer Abraham RMich all of whom lost their reelection bids By Pamela Barnett LABOR GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums Dems Seek New Rule House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood R Ga praised Labor Secretary Chaos decision to hold three public forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by September We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing their jobs or placing Americas economy in an illconceived regulatory straightjacket they said in a joint statement We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important issue moving forward and resolved Chao said Thursday But Democrats were more circumspect We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination thats what we want to avoid said John Lawrence minority staff director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee If its the first step to getting to a rule then we welcome it Ranking member George Miller DCalif and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass sent a letter to Chao in April urging her to issue a new rule But Chao has not committed herself to doing so After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton administration ergonomics rules which would have required employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced problems such as repetitivestress disorders Chao promised to review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be based on are prevention sound science incentivedriven flexibility feasibility and clarity A strong advocate of the Clinton rule the AFLCIO is analyzing the recent announcement and will respond in the very near future said Jay Power the unions legislative representative Manufacturers who opposed the Clinton rule have said in the past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the issue The forums will be held in Washington July Illinois July and California July By April Fulton HEALTH FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another attempt to relax a law that bars the reimportation of US made prescription drugs federal officials told a House Commerce subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the publics safety We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing FDAregulated products for personal use enter the US each year through international mail facilities that Customs could set aside for FDA review for possible violations of law FDA Senior Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect Hubbard testified the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to their addresses despite potential risks Hubbards testimony included the agencys strongest language yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase prescription drugs from overseas Such drugs he said may be contaminated subpotent superpotent or counterfeit FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved products are effective or safe or have been produced under US good manufacturing practices he testified USmade drugs that are reimported may not have been stored under proper conditions or may not be the real product because the United States does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies In a pilot project in California earlier this year FDA examined approximately of some packages flagged as suspicious by Customs officials Hubbard testified that some of those packages contained drugs that could not be identified drugs with labeling only in foreign languages and drugs that have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States by the FDA Several shipments contained three drugs that were once approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on serious safety concerns he testified Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in their outrage over the situation For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet said Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood RPa Their motto might very well be theres a sucker logging on every minute Last month Greenwood subcommittee ranking member Peter Deutsch DFla and Rep Bart Stupak DMich toured the international mail facility at Dulles Airport and what we found was truly frightening Greenwood said including pills hidden in carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to the law making reimportation illegal said the new information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather than loosened But while Dingell called last years legislative attempt to overturn the law a misguided effort to attempt to lower prices by opening up our borders he said Congress must recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because they cannot afford to buy them in the United States By Julie Rovner HEALTH Bilirakis Panel OpenMinded On Addressing Generic Drug Law Although some members of Congress and the brandname pharmaceutical companies are skeptical the House Energy and Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting as a way to save money We do feel we should learn enough about them the generic drug issues thats why were having the hearing next week said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Bilirakis RFla The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan in the next few days following the hearing he said Were trying to stay openminded Bilirakis said But Rep Henry Waxman DCalif said he worries about opening up the drug patent law he wrote with Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah particularly in the context of a broader Medicare prescription drug bill Its not a natural fit Waxman said However Waxman said the law might have some problems that should be addressed These include a month stay that prevents generic products from coming to market if a brandname company claims a patent infringement and the day period during which the first producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from competing with it Hatch and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass now the chairman of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee where the issue could pop up on the Senate side have expressed reservations about opening the bill in the past The brandname drug industry has not shown much interest in revamping the HatchWaxman law but the generic drug companies argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through patent challenges But brandname advocates are bracing for a fight against any such move A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said it would only jeopardize prescription drug coverage for seniors Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio recently introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved with Democratic control of the Senate but Senate aides said no official discussions have taken place since the changeover By April Fulton TRADE EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe US Unilateralism Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday that President Bushs decision to launch a Section investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next weeks EUUS summit Eliasson said the steel decision would be troublesome to a planned discussion on how the worlds two largest trading partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round Eliasson who represents all EU member countries while Sweden holds the groups presidency for the six months ending June spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in advance of the summit in Gothenberg Sweden Eliasson also said that developing a joint EUUS statement on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving to be the most difficult aspect of presummit negotiations Eliasson said the Europeans see no alternative to continuing the Kyoto Protocol talks which Bush has rejected Eliasson also said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg Lamy who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill told an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon We in Europe do not accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the steel problem The European Union he noted has cut million tons of capacity and eliminated jobs in the steel industry without introducing import restrictions Lamy said it would serve a purpose to get the facts of this troubled world industry out into the open The European Union had proposed to the United States that the fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation Lamy said but never received a reply to its suggestion Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade talks Lamy said If at the end of the day the European steelworkers have to pay this way Im not sure the new round will be very popular in Europe Lamy also said the Europeans are becoming concerned about what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic toward unilateralism Responding to speculation that the United States and the European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about launching a new round Lamy said that would be premature Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss foreign policy in the western Balkans the Middle East and Russia the Korean Peninsula the spread of HIV in Africa and the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate will take up President Bushs nominees quickly But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said Thursday that Republicans were delivering to Daschle a GOPdrafted document dealing with Bush nominations Senators said the document would be the basis for some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal statement about nominees Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the statement the general concepts have been negotiated during two meetings between Daschle and a fivemember GOP negotiating team The concepts that weve discussed with Daschle were not turned down said Sen Pete Domenici RNM Domenici said the two sides were getting close and the GOP proposal was trying to reflect the views of all of the senators that we talked to A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new organizing resolution Tuesday That would provide time for the two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference which meet separately Tuesday Both sides said the process has gone smoothly a reflection of a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement of nominees By Geoff Earle POLITICS Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a sixyear term as head of the Social Security Administrationwhich pumps out billion a year to million mainly elderly pension recipients Barnharts appointment as Social Security commissioner is subject to Senate confirmation The commissioners job is always a sensitive position because of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go out on time and keep the records straight But with the president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible battle over his plan to introduce personal stockmarket accounts to the system the job could be even tougher than normal Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs with strong links to exSen William Roth RDel She was a legislative assistant to Roth from and ran his re election campaigns in and She served as political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the cycle Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal government Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for children and families Barnhart is currently a member of the Social Security Advisory Board which advises the president Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income POLITICS Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical sampling Board member David Murray questioned the poststrata adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how many people live in a specific geographical area Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the use of census data Murray said Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nations population and using the common characteristics of people in one area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other similar census blocks Board cochairman Mark Neuman called the census the most accurate census in history and said Census Bureau experts were right to recommend against releasing sampling data for congressional redistricting Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data a special bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled data concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more accurate than traditional data Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that with more time statisticians might be able to validate the sampling data TRANSPORTATION Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla has scheduled a June hearing to give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the airlines are making in improving customer service The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to improve service along with an agreement to make these service commitments legally enforceable by including them in customer contracts The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved legislation earlier this year granting airlines limited antitrust immunity to discuss and coordinate flight schedules Mica said he expected a floor vote during the week of July The House Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill but the referral expires July POLITICS GOP Lawmakers Introduce Legislation On Monuments House Resources Chairman Hansen and nine other lawmakers announced the filing of the National Monument Fairness Act Thursday The American people deserve a voice in how their own public lands are managed said Hansen The bill gives them that voice Under this bill when a president creates a monument larger than acres he must solicit input from the public and the affected governor and congressional delegation The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the monument After that time if Congress has not approved the measure the presidents proclamation sunsets This means people who dont want a big monument in their state can talk to their local leaders their governor or their congressional delegation said Hansen At a news conference Hansen was joined by an original sponsor of the bill Rep Mike Simpson RIdaho along with GOP Reps George Radanovich of California Greg Walden of Oregon Chris Cannon of Utah Jim Gibbons of Nevada Dennis Rehberg of Montana and Jeff Flake of

changing political dynamics in the Senatecoupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug costsmay soon mean a renewed effort on the issue The House Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug bill it is drafting several key sources said The idea would be to save the government money by removing some barriers faced by generic copies of brandname drugs when they are ready to go to market sources said But any changes to the HatchWaxman lawnamed for its sponsors Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah and Rep Henry Waxman D Califcould open up a multitude of other drug patent issues that have bogged down reform for years That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between one bill or the other said a prescription drug industry source The brandname drug industry so far has been reluctant to back efforts to change the HatchWaxman law But the generic drug industry said it would welcome the change If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit it makes great sense to enact a generic drug bill said a lobbyist for the generic drug industry Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and by Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio could save as much as billion sponsors estimate CBO has yet to score them But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug companies say they could be forced to make The researchbased pharmaceutical industry estimates that it will spend about billion on research and development this year compared with billion in The industry says it develops about percent of the worlds drugs in the United States The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next Wednesday on generic drugs nonprescription drugs and other issues But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much into the scheduling of the hearing In noticing the hearing no one should try to read between the lines the spokesman said Right now were looking at a wide range of options In the end our goal is to address the issue of escalating prices without harming research and innovation HatchWaxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to Democratic control in the Senate While aides said no official discussions have taken place on moving a genericdrug bill since this weeks Democratic takeover members of at least three panelsthe Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee the Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committeehave expressed interest And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman To those who would propose to change the legislation I would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill and caution against making changes that tilt the balance Hatch told a May hearing Yet no law is so perfect that it cannot stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a changing marketplace and society Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill earlier this year that would require genericdrug companies that enter deals with brandname companies to keep their products off the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the Justice Department Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year a spokesman said By April Fulton ENERGY Armey Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican energy policy House Majority Leader Armey and Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahomaboth of whom represent oilrich statesclashed publicly this week on what action Congress should take to address the rising costs and diminishing supplies of the nations energy Responsible for House communications strategy Watts called on House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the volatile prices facing energy consumers this year We need to get answers from energy company executives including producers suppliers refiners transporters distributors and retailers with the goals of finding solutions to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the public Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen Responding to a reporters question Tuesday Armey said he opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of price gouging by the energy industry I would not personally see the need Armey said Why would one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political demagoguery And that is what it is Armey added If people want to look at the companies point their fingers at them thats just nonsense I dont care who it comes from It is just nonsense Without specifically recommending hearings Watts again urged Republican members Wednesday to provide the American people with answers about the current energy crunch saying he favored the measures proposed under President Bushs energy plan While Democrats overstate the role government should play in energy policy Republicans cannot forget that it does have a role Watts wrote in his latest memo While price caps are not an option we must insist on price accountability The Watts memo based on New Models polling data produced by Republican pollster David Winston reflects GOP concerns about the Democratic energy assault Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the party switch of Sen James Jeffords IVt instead of the Republican trillion tax cut It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on Jeffords a Watts aide said To keep the GOP tax relief message alive Watts suggested in his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer From public service announcements to franked mailings the possibilities are endless and Conference is developing a number of resources for you to use Watts wrote In his memo Watts also urged members to redouble their efforts to talk about the passage of education reform There is no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education just because the vote was gaveled he wrote An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between Armey and Watts Its just a question of exploring options the spokesman said By Mark Wegner APPROPRIATIONS Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps Kills School Lunch Program In the first test of FY appropriations spending limits House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans defeated a million proposal Wednesday to continue the international school lunch foodaid program After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla RTexas not to break the caps the subcommittee voted against the amendment sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur DOhio to the FY Agriculture appropriations bill Rep Jo Ann Emerson RMo voted with the Democrats in favor of the proposal Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican subcommittee members nervous Rep James Walsh RNY quickly proposed report language that the subcommittee strongly urges the Agriculture Department to continue the program formally known as the Global Food for Education Initiative Former Sen George McGovern DSD now US ambassador to the world food agencies in Rome and former Senate Majority Leader Dole have promoted it Kaptur asked Walsh to change the strongly urges wording to expects and the report language passed unanimously However after the markup session Kaptur said that she does not know what impact the report language will have She is inclined to re offer the amendment in full committee Bonilla initially suggested the report language but House Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis pressed for the vote saying that if the subcommittee cant get together on food aid to kids who need it he did not know what measures it could agree on The Clinton administration started the international school lunch initiative using its administrative authority to distribute surplus commodities It did not have to be scored in FY subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush administration has not stated a clear position on the school lunch initiative yet They believe a directive from the subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment for next year The subcommittee later approved the bill which provides billion for all programs of which billion is discretionary funding The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs Excluding billion in emergency appropriations in the FY bill it contains a percent increase Kaptur who has had testy relations with Bonilla said the bill was better than we expected By Jerry Hagstrom APPROPRIATIONS Dem Appropriators Criticize Administrations NSF Funding Request A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the administrations request for funding for the National Science Foundation saying it was inadequate to fully support the agencys research efforts and failed to move toward the panels goal of doubling NSF funding over five years National Journals Technology Daily reported I am disappointed in the administrations overall research and development budget and the NSF proposal in particular said Senate VAHUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski DMd This is the first time in the NSFs year history that an administration has requested Congress to cut NSFs research budget below the previous years level The administration requested billion for NSF in FY a million increase or percent which is less than the rate of inflation NSFs budget would have to rise by about million in FY to meet the goal of doubling in five years Mikulski said She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell Is this million increase what you wanted or is this what you got Colwell defended the budget request saying it focuses on areas the administration has identified as priorities such as education and training But she also added that she fully supports the panels efforts to double NSFs budget The NSF proposal calls for an percent increase for education and human resources including million for math and science partnerships and million for a program that puts graduate students in K classrooms The proposal also would increase stipends for graduate fellowships We are losing our best and brightest science students to other fields said Eamon Kelly chairman of the National Science Board who expressed support for the budget proposal Even our future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform their tasks Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of science and math education and worker literacy But she also noted the value of funding basic research in science and technology saying that if NSF had not done the work it began years ago I dont believe wed have the information technology we have today Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSFs support for nanoscale science and engineering research by percent Nanotechnology could change the way almost everything is designed from medicines to computers to automobiles The budget request would increase funding for research and related areas by percent to billion Members of the House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon characterized that funding level as inadequate About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request is that its disappointing said Rep Eddie Bernice Johnson D Texas Testifying at the House hearing NSF Deputy Director Joseph Bordogna said the budgets focus on people was intentional NSF is as much about building a worldclass workforce as it is about discovery he said It is important to emphasize that research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is fundamental to NSFs mission By Robert Lamb APPROPRIATIONS Despite Shrunken Surplus GOP Sees Increased FY Cushion Despite CBOs reduced estimate of next years surplus Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY budget cushion of about billioneven after setting aside the politically untouchable Medicare trustfund surplus GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller thanallowed costs of the FY share of the trillion tax cut The experts explained their estimates of the figures in response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the FY cushion may have sagged to as low as billion based on CBOs revised surplus estimates Democrats meanwhile countered that the tax cut which President Bush plans to sign today relies on an accounting gimmick in FY to make additional money available In FY and beyond this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trustfund surplusdespite language in the budget resolution that bars Congress from doing so In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt DSC planned to release today Democrats charge that the trillion tax cut exhausts the available surplus in through and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and Medicare even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits in the budget resolution The FY budget resolution approved by Congress used CBOs January baseline to project a total FY budget surplus of billion with an onbudget surplus of billion of which billion comes from the Medicare Part A trustfund surplus The remaining billion of the surplus was left as a reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget including the increase in defense spending expected to result from Defense Secretary Rumsfelds strategic review Last week CBO released its analysis of the presidents budget using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the surplus by billion In April CBO recalculated the FY Medicare trust fund at billionor billion larger than estimated in January Taken together CBOs most recent estimates of the total surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of the FY reserve by billion leaving only billion in the reserve The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by billion in FY But the final tax package that Congress enacted as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation carries an FY price tag of just billionmeaning that billion budgeted for but not spent in the tax bill should be included in the available FY surplus CBOs January baseline produced a reserve of nearly billion for FY assuming the tax bill would use up the entire billion provided in the budget Because the tax bill actually cost billion less the reserve instead would amount to about billion using the January surplus estimates Using the less generous May baseline and the morethan billion reserve it produces the unspent portion of the tax bill would take the FY reserve to almost billion In both cases the reserve represents the size of the surplus after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set aside In the analysis being issued today Democrats say the size of the tax cut means that funding priorities like defense modernization a Medicare prescription drug benefit or educationpriorities that even Republicans supportwill require a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes Either the resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social Security and Medicare or funding of other national priorities must be severely cutsimply because the tax cut is too big The Democratic analysis uses CBOs May baseline and includes the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the budget resolution adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation It projects an available surplus outside the Social Security and Medicare trust funds of billion in FY a figure that accounts for billion in debt service costsbut a deficit of billion in FY and a billion deficit in FY As for the FY surplus Democrats counter that Republicans were only able to show a surplus by using a billion accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY to FY As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with the budget resolution a provision delays the deadline for corporate estimatedtax payments from September to October effectively making the billion in estimated revenue available on the first day of FY instead of at the end of FY By Lisa Caruso TRADE AntiNAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be facing this year is the establishment of a freetrade agreement with Chile A group of labor and environmental organizations known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans today to step up lobbying against the deal The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Friends of the Earth along with a number of labor groups from Chile The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with Chile worked out by the end of the year It is expected that such an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free Trade Agreement which many labor environmental and human rights groups charge has adversely affected US jobs and environmental standards in the business corridor along the USMexican border Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade with Chile are Sens Christopher Dodd DConn and Phil Gramm R Texas Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed trade deal sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the bitter NAFTA controversy While significant differences remain between the United States and Chile over the details of the deal the administration has stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a Free Trade Area of Americas and the Chilean pact would help advance that effort In addition such a pact would help Chile play a higher profile role in South American political and economic affairs than its rival Brazil To help bring about the FTAA many observers believe it is essential for the president to have broad presidential trade negotiating authority Formerly known as fast track the proposal is moving up on the congressional agenda House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to see a measure on the floor as soon as July and Senate Finance Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential tradenegotiating authority But Baucus has insisted that labor and environmental matters be taken into account This week the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to Congress members It outlines a spate of bilateral trade agreements in recent yearsoften without US participation and at the expense of the United States To shore up the US role in trade matters the Business Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration calls trade promotion authority as quickly as possible By Stephen Norton TECHNOLOGY HighTech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a higher priority in the chamber members of the Silicon Valley lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the issue National Journals Technology Daily reported In a conference call earlier this week lobbyists for high tech companies including HewlettPackard Cisco Systems Sun Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy principles without advocating or opposing any particular legislation The list then could be used to educate senators on how to view any particular privacy bill Companies are still trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of legislation or not said one person familiar with the TechNet call The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings who sponsored a tough privacy bill in the th Congress fueled speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved Expectations for action in had dimmed over the past six months as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill But several hightech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed personal interest in protecting consumers privacy and could become more aggressive on the issue Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher priorities such as transportation and television violence A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling his priorities Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz have reintroduced the privacy bills they sponsored in the th Congress TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the organizations members are working on opening a dialogue with Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee is expected to consider She also said TechNet had been planning to develop privacy principles Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be developing the groups privacy principles She also would not comment on what direction the group might pursue The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to take on privacy with some companies and associations taking a stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others advocating a freemarket approach to determining a solution to privacy protection Meanwhile the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an agreement on committee assignments Hollings is officially the chairman but any freshman members such as Sen George Allen RVa currently have no seats on Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is based on the organizational structure adopted for the th Congress By Bara Vaida AGRICULTURE Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs Representatives of agricultural conservation wildlife and industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday when they testified before the House Agriculture Conservation Credit Rural Development and Research Subcommittee Craig Cox executive vice president of the Soil and Water Conservation Society called for doubling the Agriculture Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting a new billion stewardshipbased farm and ranch program to pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation practices If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued Cox said farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm program Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program The increased spending would require a dramatically expanded Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide technical services he said A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze the stewardship contracts farmers would have to take out with the government to get the money Cox said Cox said the societys proposal based on two years of interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in agriculture would be available to farmers throughout the country unlike the current commodity programs which concentrate assistance in the Plains and the South The proposal envisions largescale assistance to ranchers with grazing land and to growers of specialty crops Asked his views on limits to conservation payments Cox said he believes the money should go those who deliver environmental goods and services to the taxpayer The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture testified in favor of block grants to state governments to develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state Wildlife groups asked for an expansion of the landidling Conservation Reserve Program to million acres But the National Grain and Feed Association which represents agricultural suppliers said the CRP should not be expanded beyond the current million acres After the hearing Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas ROkla said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be costly The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority of groups asked for in the commodity title plus what most groups have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the entire farm bill Lucas said That is why I want to focus on what is working and what is not working what is being done efficiently and effectively and what is not By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Dorgan Democrats Will Rule Senate With A Different Tone Democrats will seek to promote a different tone and a different style as the majority party although the new political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda and relationships that shape the Capitol according to Sen Byron Dorgan DND The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to what we have to do in the next few weeks Dorgan who cochairs the Democratic Policy Committee said Wednesday during a wide ranging interview with CongressDaily Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation the Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY appropriations bills On energy issues a top Bush administration priority Dorgan said the presidents plan is not a balanced plan He said the Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that is much more significant than any of us thought Dorgan who met with newly installed Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday said Democratic legislation would focus on production conservation renewable energy and efficiency of appliances Emphasizing an area of agreement with the White House he said there were opportunities to join on incentives to encourage production My hope is we dont debate the production issue over ANWR he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to encourage conservationbut did not say how they would offset costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include Democrats and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit the trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today The budget is passed The tax cut is passed That largely settled those fiscal policy issues for the year Dorgan said Dorgan who will chair the Senate TreasuryPostal Appropriations Subcommittee predicted little change at the Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell RColo Dorgan noted that most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way and anticipated little change in the panels spending priorities under his chairmanship The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the same time they are trying to move the two largest spending billsDefense and LaborHHS With little room to maneuver Congress might again be forced to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from busting the budget or round up the votes needed in the Senate to raise the caps The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly billion FY supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week With only million in offsets the supplemental uses up nearly the entire billion by which Congress raised the FY in the budget resolution Any more spending added to the supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an emergency But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend beyond the percent increase for FY the administration has called for Otherwise be prepared for presidential vetoes Daniels warned this week In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other appropriators Dorgan said Mitch Daniels is sounding his political horn these days I would sooner he just get down to business and work with us and back off the politics just a little bit Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how the year would unfold although he reflected on several new trends Majority Leader Daschle will play a much more pivotal role in national politics now than he did as minority leader he said Dorgan said Vermont Sen James Jeffords switch to independent status is not likely to be repeated in this Congress by other senators A close confidant of the new leader Dorgan praised Daschle for his decentralized leadership style He brings people in He meets He has the patience of Job declared Dorgan Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair will switch from playing occasional defense to developing more of an issues agenda Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic amendments when Republicans were in the majority Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having absolute control on the floor of issues he said adding that Democratic leaders have discussed how they will operate differently I suspect you will see legislation coming to the floor of the Senate without the restrictions Senator Lott imposed Dorgan said Dorgan acknowledged that Democrats had to try to accommodate Republicans because they hold such a narrow majority Theres certainly a danger of high expectations he said Nothing much has changed except the majority leader and the committee chairs The Republicans learned and we understand that its not easy to get things done in a Senate thats evenly split By Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso SENATE LEADERSHIP Organizing Talks Continue Daschle Asks MondayFriday Schedule A team of five Republican senators met for a second time Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Daschle to negotiate a new organizing resolution to reflect Democratic control of the Senateand for the second straight day the two sides described productive and cordial talks but reported no final agreement We had a good meeting and thats all I can say Daschle said late Wednesday Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said the negotiating team had another good productive meeting with Daschle adding I believe were making progress Everybody wants to solve this thingI think we pretty well have done what we want to do Moderate GOP Sen Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he believed some reality has set in among his Republican colleagues many of whom were urging a hard line in the negotiations earlier this week There were a lot less aggressive tones today in a meeting of the GOP Conference than even back in January when the power sharing agreement was negotiated for a Senate And it was a much more logical conversation than earlier in the week he said There wasnt much of a moderateconservative split in there One change will soon become evident in the Senate Daschle said the chamber would begin working on a MondaythroughFriday schedule Throughout the day Wednesday Republicans continued to raise the issue of judicial and other nominees although the demand for written assurances that such nominations would receive a floor vote seemed to recede as the day progressed Still Sen Rick Santorum RPa said there was broad concern within the GOP Conference that members of the new majority have made statements that would change the precedent on nominees Santorum said he had never called for a rules change to address the issue but said he was concerned by comments he attributed to Judiciary Chairman Leahy that nominees can be disqualified simply because they are conservatives We need to confirm with the Democratic side that there will be no break with precedent he said But Santorum agreed that the operating resolution should be resolved within another day or so Sen Edward Kennedy DMass a senior member of the Judiciary Committee was dismissive of the idea that Bush administration nominees should receive any special consideration Bill Lan Lee is my answer to that he said in reference to a Clinton administration Justice Department nomination that Republicans refused to bring forward for a vote We will hear from the Justice Department on judicial nominees and we will have full and fair hearings But there is no presumption to be on the Supreme Court GOP Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho said one of the options Republicans were discussing was dealing with their concerns about nominations for the record either through a dialogue on the Senate floor or through some other type of understanding He predicted that negotiations could be completed today although he said his guess was it would not be voted on until next week The option is to take the appropriate time Craig said Craig agreed with statements by Daschle that the two parties might try to reach an understanding that if Republicans were to regain control the now defunct power sharing resolution would again take effect Thats probably fairly close said Craig who also seemed to indicate that Democrats had reacted favorably to some GOP suggestions Weve asked for several things that they think are fair that we think are fair But he also acknowledged that as the minority party Republicans had limited tools at their disposal We cannot scalp Pat Leahy he said of the Judiciary Committee chairman By Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle POLITICS Morella Declines Governor Bid Focus Shifts To Ehrlich Rep Constance Morella RMd disclosed Tuesday that she would not run for

elected in to her Montgomery Countybased seat The decision turns the statewide spotlight on GOP Rep Robert Ehrlich who plans to make an announcement this summer on whether he will seek the governors office But pollster Keith Haller said Morellas announcement is a big setback for the Maryland Republican Partybecause polls showed her to be a formidable statewide candidate and because Democrats would have a hard time as portraying the politically moderate Morella as out of the mainstream Ehrlich as regarded as more conservative But Haller added Ehrlich now has a wideopen opportunity to assume the Republican mantle should he believe its politically feasible The leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt Gov Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Sen

go they let out a groan reminiscent of Lurch on The Addams Family But not Mitch Daniels The OMB director still thinks everything may turn out OKalthough he is a little less optimistic now that the Democrats have taken over the Senate Were very serious about this being an orderly process Daniels said in an interview this week Asked if the process can be smooth Daniels said Well find out But he also said Im confident we were on our way to that and Im confident we can still do it He conceded that working with Democrats leading the Senate may be different from working with the Republicans but said Well have to be flexible where we can be For the past few years of the Clinton administration thenOMB Director Lew started the season with a speech in which he projected gloom and doom The budget resolution contained false numbersThey were too lowNobody believed that was the amount the government really would spendWe would end up in a budget confrontation at the end of the fiscal year and the confrontation would drag into November or later Many predict the same endgame this year They contend education defense and other priorities will exceed the budget resolution and the spending caps will be increased Daniels is making it clear that that is not acceptable Rather than start with a speech he opened the appropriations season with an oped piece in the Washington Post in which he emphasized that the administration wants to stick with this years budget resolution In this weeks interview Daniels said he is trying to change the way OMB interacts with Congress to try to convince members Republicans used to complain that OMB only entered the appropriations process at the endwhen the president threatened a veto and the endgame negotiations had to begin Daniels said OMB is trying to work with Congress at the start of the process Asked when his office became involved he commented Have been are will be OMB officials already have met with appropriations subcommittee staff and will continue to do so throughout the process Daniels said The new strategy was a careful calculation he said As a former Senate staffer he certainly realizes that members carefully protect their prerogatives And he kept saying OMB would be only as involved as appropriators want them to be But having said that Daniels added From the beginning it seemed clear to me that we wanted to be in body contact with the appropriators all the way and we have been However he is not sure how the appropriations dynamic changes with changeover in the Senate This moves the needle a little bit but not far As Republicans have been fond of pointing out the membership of the Senate has not changed But of course being bipartisan means swallowing hard sometimes and being willing to compromiseeven on pork barrel projects a particular target of the administration President Bush has made it clear he wants to cut down on earmarked projects In the supplemental spending bill sent to Congress this month Bush proposed to rescind some million earmarked last year for I in Arkansasmoney put in the Transportation bill to try to help the unsuccessful reelection campaign of former appropriator Rep Jay Dickey RArk The proposed rescission has been criticizedand clearly is a sign that Bush is targeting such projects Even so Daniels said the administration realizes it is going to have to be somewhat pragmatic We called a lot of attention to the sixfold explosion of earmarks which is a distinctly bipartisan phenomenon Daniels said But he quickly added We do think this trend ought to be reined in but were realistic To the extent that this is a lubricant to the process or a bipartisan process we recognize that a lot of it will go on Although Democrats have repeatedly criticized this years budget process Daniels believes it worked fine But Bush has proposed a series of budget reformsranging from a twoyear budget cycle to an automatic continuing resolution that would go into effect if Congress did not complete the annual funding bills by the end of the year Daniels said that reform of the CR process would be a good place to start Appropriators have said they believe an automatic CR takes away all of the incentive to complete the individual bills The administration believes just the opposite The president interprets it as a way to move the process to conclusion to avoid endofsession chaos said Daniels And of course endofsession chaos is something everyone especially the presidentwould like to avoid By David Baumann COLUMN HOUSE RACE HOTLINE A Very Special Time Of Year hardly has been an off

ENVIRONMENT Administration Will Address Global Warming Rice Says White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice indicated Wednesday that the administration will advance ideas about global warming before President Bush leaves for Europe next week but she was unclear about whether Bush himself will speak on the issue as many expect Rice said Bush would be ready to share what weve learned thus far with the allies during his trip Rice who briefed reporters on the trip agenda said the Cabinetlevel group mulling the issue has not determined what it will tell the president before he embarks But she indicated that whatever information it gives Bush the group will not issue final recommendations before he meets with European leaders who have criticized his decision to scrap the Kyoto treaty Rice confirmed that Bush believes global warming is taking place but added that the advisory groupwhich includes EPA Administrator Whitman Energy Secretary Abraham Treasury Secretary ONeill Interior Secretary Norton and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Lindseyis trying to understand better what we dont know Rice said the panel is exploring the evidence that sequestrationthe removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plant lifecan play a role in dealing with emissionsamong other proposals POLITICS Moderate Republicans Help Dems Win First Senate Vote Moderate Republicans helped Senate Democrats win their first vote since Democrats took control of the chamber Wednesday on an amendment sponsored by Sen Paul Wellstone DMinn to the education bill It requires states to develop quality peer reviewed tests before receiving grants But Democrats may face a more difficult challenge today Wellstone along with Sen Christopher Dodd DConn is planning to offer an amendment to prevent states from being required to comply with President Bushs plan to test every child in grades unless the federal government fully funds Title I Title I provides funds to educate poor and disadvantaged students and Democrats have argued that traditionally it has been underfunded Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy who is managing the bill on the floor will oppose the socalled trigger amendment because it would undercut the bill a spokesman said Senator Kennedy shares Sen Wellstones concern However efforts to secure additional funding should not set back the efforts to put into place the quality assessments said a spokesman TRADE Bush Orders Permits For Firms To Truck International Cargo President Bush ordered Wednesday that US businesses owned by Mexican citizens be permitted to truck international cargo between points within the United States The order in a memorandum to Transportation Secretary Mineta that will be published in the

FY While essentially in line with President Bushs requests they differ in some cases by billions of dollars In allocations being released today House appropriators are recommending billion more than Bush wanted for LaborHHS billion more for VAHUD and billion more for Energy and Water The socalled b allocations which the Appropriations Committee should mark up by next week divide the billion set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary appropriations among the Appropriations subcommittees The proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in April however were based on his request that total FY spending be kept to billion The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee All numbers are expressed in budget authority followed by the Bush administration proposal Agriculture billion compared to the Bush proposal of billion CommerceJusticeState billion compared to billion Defense billion billion District of Columbia million million Energy and Water billion billion Foreign Operations billion the same as Bush proposed Interior billion billion LaborHHS billion billion Legislative Branch billion billion Military Construction billion billion Transportation billion billion TreasuryPostal billion billion VAHUD billion billion Meanwhile on the FY front House Appropriations Chairman Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Lewis RCalif both said Thursday that they intend to stick to the presidents supplemental appropriations recommendation despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush administrations nearly billion FY supplemental spending request shortchanges the military The supplemental would provide a total of billion for defense partially offset by million in defense cuts House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman Curt Weldon RPa called the request totally inadequate saying the needs are at least billion Congress ought to provide more money using an emergency designation he said But constrained by the budget caps and the administrations admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the presidents requested level Weve got to be in the real world said Lewis The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but not counted against the cap Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as early as next week and conference with the Senate by July th Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo one of the administrations allies on the Hill said the president would be eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto The president wont be hesitant to veto an early bill Blunt said I think theyre looking for an early opportunity to show their commitment to discipline on spending I wouldnt be at all surprised if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental to see a veto In the Senate where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens RAlaska a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would stick with the presidents overall number on the supplemental Daniels who has insisted that the FY supplemental be kept to true currentyear needs and stay within the budget caps defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress I think Congress is going to see that these items are about the right ones Daniels said By Lisa Caruso HOUSE LEADERSHIP Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House Despite Minority Leader Gephardts plea this week for a new era of bipartisan collaboration the Democratic takeover of the Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in the House according to House Republican leaders with close ties to the Bush White House In fact one key leader House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo said House Republicans feel liberated to pass legislation more to their liking Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased opportunity to get our work done without having to give overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate Blunt said Not that we wont be considerate but there wont be overwhelming consideration Previously we held back on some things in consideration of Senator Lotts challenges Blunt who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans and the White House said he expected the House to pass an energy bill a prescription drug benefit a campaign finance reform measureand perhaps legislation to make permanent this years package of tax cutsall before the August recess These will all be placed on Mr Daschles desk before we go home for the August break Blunt said suggesting the pressure will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with bills backed by the House and President Bush House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the balance of the year in an interview Thursdaymentioning energy prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a patients bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade negotiating authority as top priorities He also spoke favorably about a costofliving increase for members of Congress a subject he discussed earlier in the day with Gephardt Lawmakers ought to be able to keep up with the cost of living so that they can take care of their families and provide for their families like everybody else does Hastert said I think thats the decent thing to do Rep Rob Portman ROhio who chairs House GOP leadership meetings told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference since Sen James Jeffords IVt decided last month to bolt the Republican Party was a little more sensitivity by the White House and our leadership in reaching out to moderatesWhere you might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings Gephardt said this week that Jeffords move could embolden GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats But Portman who served in the administration of Bushs father and has strong ties to the current White House noted that moderate GOP Rep Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the elected leadership as Conference secretary And Rep Doug Ose RCalif serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP leadership Weve already formalized something that the Senate Republicans are just now formalizing Portman said in reference to the appointment of Sen Arlen Specter RPa as the moderates representative within leadership Portman did not indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership was imminent In the two weeks since Jeffords switch House Republican moderates have praised Hasterts leadership of and played down any tensions within their Conference Rep Michael Castle RDel for example said he thought the Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength as a master of compromisebut in the meantime expressed confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was Our views are being taken into consideration Blunt said pointing to efforts by Reps Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut among others to persuade Jeffords to stay put Gephardt this week said he stood with olive branches in both hands but that the House Republican leadership has stiffarmed Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels Civility has been improved but we havent had real bipartisanship Gephardt told reporters House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those olive branches but they did make clear that they have a different definition of bipartisanship Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the first six months of said one White House aide who noted that Karl Rove Bushs top political adviser has been keeping score of all the meetings with Democrats Clintons numbers of meetings with Republicans just pale in comparisonWe did a lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and well just keep on doing it Portman said I dont buy Gephardts premise The two most important bills education and taxes were not rammed through on partyline votes But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative House Democrats reiterated that groups complaint that Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development of legislation The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy A House Democratic leadership source said Its been clear for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed any interest in bipartisan cooperation It may take them awhile to come around The source said the problem extended to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue as well declaring The president has given Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames and hes given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice Department By Charlie Mitchell HOUSE RACES Largent Will Resign From House Calls For Early Special Election Setting the stage for the Houses seventh special election this year Republican Rep Steve Largent announced Thursday that he will resign his Tulsabased st District seat in November to concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a fulltime endeavor in the months ahead Largent said Therefore today I announce my plan to resign on Nov exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov Frank Keating to pass a law in the Legislatures upcoming special session to schedule a special election before Largents effective resignation date I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them to allow the election to take place prior to my actual resignation as was done in with former Democratic Sen David Borens departure from the US Senate Largent said This action would ensure that the st District is never without representation in Washington Largent said Largent formerly a recordsetting wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks entered the House when GOP Sen James Inhofe resigned the House seat to assume Borens Senate seat During his tenure Largent has earned a reputation as a champion of Christian conservative causes He has occasionally bucked his partys leadership and supported the coup attempt against former House Speaker Gingrich He unsuccessfully challenged House Majority Leader Armey in In his resignation announcement Largent said he would remain neutral in the GOP primary which already has grown contentious in anticipation of Largents gubernatorial run The Republican field for Largents seat includes state Rep John Sullivan state Sen Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady Cathy Keating the wife of the Republican governor whose term is up in National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia Thursday called the seat strongly Republican noting that Largent never had received less than percent of the vote in the district Nonetheless at least two Democrats have considered entering the race Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely Democratic nominee while former Tulsa County Democratic Party leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats they can win the seat but he was confident about the prospects That seat is competitive for Democrats Parmley said Make no mistake about it During the th Congress the deaths of Reps Julian Dixon DCalif Norman Sisisky DVa and Joe Moakley DMass have necessitated special elections Largent joins former Rep Bud Shuster RPa and Rep Joe Scarborough RFla in retirement announcements Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk also is expected to resign his seat to accept a position in the Bush administration see related article below By Mark Wegner JUDICIARY Hutchinsons Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation The impending departure of Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk whose nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is expected to be confirmed by the Senate has left the business community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive bill to limit legal liability for business Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Wholesalers It would cap punitive damages for small businesses and for product sellers Introduced last month the bill restricts punitive damages against businesses with fewer than employees and limits awards to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or whichever is less Sens Joseph Lieberman DConn and Mitch McConnell RKy are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate However the loss of Hutchinson a highprofile member of the House Judiciary Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform is a blow for bill proponents observers said this week And the loss is even more significant they say given the shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications for legal reform legislation in general The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most viable of the pending legal reform measureson product liability and class action reformwas considered daunting in a closely divided Senate But with Democrats controlling the agenda numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly impossible At the same time some observers noted the bipartisan appeal of the small business communitycombined with President Bushs expected effort later in his term to advance his civiljustice reform agendacould help move the ball on some piecemeal reforms This is not the first time this year that supporters of product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional sponsors The legislations sponsors in the past Congress included former Rep James Rogan RCalif and former Sens John Ashcroft RMo and Spencer Abraham RMich all of whom lost their reelection bids By Pamela Barnett LABOR GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums Dems Seek New Rule House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood R Ga praised Labor Secretary Chaos decision to hold three public forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by September We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing their jobs or placing Americas economy in an illconceived regulatory straightjacket they said in a joint statement We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important issue moving forward and resolved Chao said Thursday But Democrats were more circumspect We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination thats what we want to avoid said John Lawrence minority staff director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee If its the first step to getting to a rule then we welcome it Ranking member George Miller DCalif and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass sent a letter to Chao in April urging her to issue a new rule But Chao has not committed herself to doing so After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton administration ergonomics rules which would have required employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced problems such as repetitivestress disorders Chao promised to review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be based on are prevention sound science incentivedriven flexibility feasibility and clarity A strong advocate of the Clinton rule the AFLCIO is analyzing the recent announcement and will respond in the very near future said Jay Power the unions legislative representative Manufacturers who opposed the Clinton rule have said in the past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the issue The forums will be held in Washington July Illinois July and California July By April Fulton HEALTH FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another attempt to relax a law that bars the reimportation of US made prescription drugs federal officials told a House Commerce subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the publics safety We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing FDAregulated products for personal use enter the US each year through international mail facilities that Customs could set aside for FDA review for possible violations of law FDA Senior Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect Hubbard testified the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to their addresses despite potential risks Hubbards testimony included the agencys strongest language yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase prescription drugs from overseas Such drugs he said may be contaminated subpotent superpotent or counterfeit FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved products are effective or safe or have been produced under US good manufacturing practices he testified USmade drugs that are reimported may not have been stored under proper conditions or may not be the real product because the United States does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies In a pilot project in California earlier this year FDA examined approximately of some packages flagged as suspicious by Customs officials Hubbard testified that some of those packages contained drugs that could not be identified drugs with labeling only in foreign languages and drugs that have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States by the FDA Several shipments contained three drugs that were once approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on serious safety concerns he testified Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in their outrage over the situation For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet said Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood RPa Their motto might very well be theres a sucker logging on every minute Last month Greenwood subcommittee ranking member Peter Deutsch DFla and Rep Bart Stupak DMich toured the international mail facility at Dulles Airport and what we found was truly frightening Greenwood said including pills hidden in carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell DMich whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to the law making reimportation illegal said the new information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather than loosened But while Dingell called last years legislative attempt to overturn the law a misguided effort to attempt to lower prices by opening up our borders he said Congress must recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because they cannot afford to buy them in the United States By Julie Rovner HEALTH Bilirakis Panel OpenMinded On Addressing Generic Drug Law Although some members of Congress and the brandname pharmaceutical companies are skeptical the House Energy and Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting as a way to save money We do feel we should learn enough about them the generic drug issues thats why were having the hearing next week said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Bilirakis RFla The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan in the next few days following the hearing he said Were trying to stay openminded Bilirakis said But Rep Henry Waxman DCalif said he worries about opening up the drug patent law he wrote with Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah particularly in the context of a broader Medicare prescription drug bill Its not a natural fit Waxman said However Waxman said the law might have some problems that should be addressed These include a month stay that prevents generic products from coming to market if a brandname company claims a patent infringement and the day period during which the first producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from competing with it Hatch and Sen Edward Kennedy DMass now the chairman of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee where the issue could pop up on the Senate side have expressed reservations about opening the bill in the past The brandname drug industry has not shown much interest in revamping the HatchWaxman law but the generic drug companies argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through patent challenges But brandname advocates are bracing for a fight against any such move A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said it would only jeopardize prescription drug coverage for seniors Sens Charles Schumer DNY and John McCain RAriz and Reps Jo Ann Emerson RMo and Sherrod Brown DOhio recently introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved with Democratic control of the Senate but Senate aides said no official discussions have taken place since the changeover By April Fulton TRADE EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe US Unilateralism Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday that President Bushs decision to launch a Section investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next weeks EUUS summit Eliasson said the steel decision would be troublesome to a planned discussion on how the worlds two largest trading partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round Eliasson who represents all EU member countries while Sweden holds the groups presidency for the six months ending June spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in advance of the summit in Gothenberg Sweden Eliasson also said that developing a joint EUUS statement on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving to be the most difficult aspect of presummit negotiations Eliasson said the Europeans see no alternative to continuing the Kyoto Protocol talks which Bush has rejected Eliasson also said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg Lamy who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill told an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon We in Europe do not accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the steel problem The European Union he noted has cut million tons of capacity and eliminated jobs in the steel industry without introducing import restrictions Lamy said it would serve a purpose to get the facts of this troubled world industry out into the open The European Union had proposed to the United States that the fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation Lamy said but never received a reply to its suggestion Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade talks Lamy said If at the end of the day the European steelworkers have to pay this way Im not sure the new round will be very popular in Europe Lamy also said the Europeans are becoming concerned about what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic toward unilateralism Responding to speculation that the United States and the European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about launching a new round Lamy said that would be premature Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss foreign policy in the western Balkans the Middle East and Russia the Korean Peninsula the spread of HIV in Africa and the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change By Jerry Hagstrom SENATE LEADERSHIP Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate will take up President Bushs nominees quickly But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said Thursday that Republicans were delivering to Daschle a GOPdrafted document dealing with Bush nominations Senators said the document would be the basis for some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal statement about nominees Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the statement the general concepts have been negotiated during two meetings between Daschle and a fivemember GOP negotiating team The concepts that weve discussed with Daschle were not turned down said Sen Pete Domenici RNM Domenici said the two sides were getting close and the GOP proposal was trying to reflect the views of all of the senators that we talked to A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new organizing resolution Tuesday That would provide time for the two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference which meet separately Tuesday Both sides said the process has gone smoothly a reflection of a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement of nominees By Geoff Earle POLITICS Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a sixyear term as head of the Social Security Administrationwhich pumps out billion a year to million mainly elderly pension recipients Barnharts appointment as Social Security commissioner is subject to Senate confirmation The commissioners job is always a sensitive position because of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go out on time and keep the records straight But with the president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible battle over his plan to introduce personal stockmarket accounts to the system the job could be even tougher than normal Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs with strong links to exSen William Roth RDel She was a legislative assistant to Roth from and ran his re election campaigns in and She served as political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the cycle Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal government Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for children and families Barnhart is currently a member of the Social Security Advisory Board which advises the president Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income POLITICS Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical sampling Board member David Murray questioned the poststrata adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how many people live in a specific geographical area Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the use of census data Murray said Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nations population and using the common characteristics of people in one area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other similar census blocks Board cochairman Mark Neuman called the census the most accurate census in history and said Census Bureau experts were right to recommend against releasing sampling data for congressional redistricting Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data a special bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled data concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more accurate than traditional data Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that with more time statisticians might be able to validate the sampling data TRANSPORTATION Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla has scheduled a June hearing to give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the airlines are making in improving customer service The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to improve service along with an agreement to make these service commitments legally enforceable by including them in

Mica said he expected a floor vote during the week of July The House Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill but the referral expires July POLITICS GOP Lawmakers Introduce Legislation On Monuments House Resources Chairman Hansen and nine other lawmakers announced the filing of the National Monument Fairness Act Thursday The American people deserve a voice in how their own public lands are managed said Hansen The bill gives them that voice Under this bill when a president creates a monument larger than acres he must solicit input from the public and the affected governor and congressional delegation The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the monument After that time if Congress has not approved the measure the presidents proclamation sunsets This means people who dont want a big monument in their state can talk to their local leaders their governor or their congressional delegation said Hansen At a news conference Hansen was joined by an original sponsor of the bill Rep Mike Simpson RIdaho along with GOP Reps George Radanovich of California Greg Walden of Oregon Chris Cannon of Utah Jim Gibbons of Nevada Dennis Rehberg of Montana and Jeff Flake of
