<4560735.1075857677548.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mrha@enron.com,2001-05-21 15:11:05,RE Recent deal Cc It is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination for closed deals On ECFs behalf Bilberry and Hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded Also the PRC process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a persons PL for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of Enron The value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of PL to the overall Formosa deal I do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over million to Enron At best the current value of the closed transaction across EGM ECF and ENA is under million In addition EGM did compensate Bilberry and Hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the TEPPCO contract and incremental transportation volumes from Williams I certainly hope we can work out this PL issue to incentive employees to work on transactions across business lines Regards Jean Original Message From Goodpasture John Sent Thursday May AM To Mrha Jean Subject RE Recent deal Jean It is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination in the form of specific monetary awards for specific projectsdeals The individuals achievements are incorporated into the overall PRC and of course appropriate rewardspromotions would flow from that process Messrs Bilberry and Hilgert indicated that the overall deal was worth over MM to Enron The value of the Formosa storage transaction would be a very small part of that total Surely any specific grants that ENA wished to make could be amply supported by the larger value that would accrue directly to ENA JNG Original Message From Mrha Jean Sent Tuesday May AM To Goodpasture John Subject RE Recent deal John Thank you for noticing the sucess that both Chris Hilgert and Mike Bilberry had in negotiating and closing the many complex contract arrangements between numerous parties in order to get the Formosa deal executed I am also happy that Clean Fuels is pleased with their new long term storage arrangement with Formosa and am sure it will create much value for your organization As such I am assuming that you plan to grant origination to Chris and Mike to compensate them for their time and negotiations with Formosa on ECFs behalf Please contact me regarding the number you would like to propose Chris has worked on a presentation for ECF on this transaction and I will be reviewing it today Regards Jean Mrha Original Message From Goodpasture John Sent Wednesday May AM To Bilberry Michael Hilgert Chris Cc Mrha Jean Subject Recent deal Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa TEPPCO et al It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters timing pressures volumes etc so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible Thanks again John Goodpasture
