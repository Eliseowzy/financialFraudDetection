listed on Bombay Stock Exchange BSE on Monday June and is traded on the B group on the BSE under ticker code We have purchased shares at Rs per share total of Rs million The site for the BSE is wwwbseindiacom The shares are owned by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited Mauritius Based The physical share certificates are with Enron India in a vault in a bank There is no lock up restriction on the shares purchased by us and we are free to sell these shares I am not clear on the materal nonpublic information and who would need to give the certification Could you clarify where the requirement for the certification arises and send me a copy of the form of the certificate We would need a broker in India who is authorised to deal on the BSE to execute the transactions A person acting on behalf of Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited Mauritius would need to enter into the relevant agreements and authorisations I do not think that Goldman Sachs would be able to sell these shares on our behalf on the BSE as we would need a broker here in India to execute the deal Under Indian Regulations the proceeds from the sale of shares on behalf of the foriegn company needs to be deposited in a rupee bank account and then can be onward remitted to Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited account The bank has the responsibility of carrying out the due diligence for adherence to the current Reserve Baank of India rules regarding sale of shares in the Indian Market by an overseas company I hope that I have provided the relevant information required In addition I have enclosed

cc Subject Genesys Sale of Shares RBI approvall FYI It would seem we still have a lot of ground to cover on selling Genesys Forwarded by Lauren HagertyENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Chandran Bhaskar AM To Rahul BasuENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Sandeep KatwalaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Raj ThaparENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Gopalakrishnan SubramaniamENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Veena SrinivasanENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Lauren HagertyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Genesys Sale of Shares RBI approvall Dear Rahul Your mail on the above subject refers As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd Mauritius i list below the following A Approvals required Per section B the FEMA Regulations effective June transfer by way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares debentures held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI Veena your activity chart shows that Form TS is to be filed after the sale is effected money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds Since the Act prescribes prior approval we should sell only after receipt of RBI approval and not before The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement the application should be supported with the average quotation of the share price average of daily high and low for one week proceeding the date of application duly certified by a Chartered Accountant If the sale proposed to be effected on the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market price the Chartered Accountants certification is not required Since we intend selling at the floor this certification is not required B Thinly Traded I refer to Veenas query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded Per section Explanation i the share will be treated as thinly traded if the annualised trading turnover in that share on a main stock exchanges in India during the six calendar months preceding the month in which the application is made is less than by number of shares of the listed stock Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only from June it is to be noted that the new shares issued to a the erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of amalgamation approved by the High Court Mumbai b the applicants of the private placement incl Enron and the new amalgamated company Genesys International Corporation Limited whose previous name was Aeke Trading and Investments Limited was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange Hence it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded or not FYI the Paid Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was Equity Shares of Rs each aggregating Rs We can apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded It is better to check this provision C Formalities for remittance Per section of the FEMA Regulations remittance of sale proceeds shall be made by a authorised dealer upon satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation basis we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No SIANFC NRI to the AD submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and submission of a No Objection Certificate tax clearance certificate D Income Tax NoC TCC I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty we need not obtain the NoC of the IT In my view since the regulation stipulates an NoC TCC from the IT Department i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC TCC of the IT In the past this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificateconfirming there are no tax implications in the underlying transaction one could remit the funds without a NoCTCC from IT But given a very specific statement us of the FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from June and hasnt been time tested i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification In my view NoC would be a pre requisite E Bank Account Assuming that the NoC is required there will be a timing difference between we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after obtaining the NoC from IT It is certainly not advisable to hold the instrument without encashing it Hence opening of a Bank Account in India to encash the instrument is warranted I refer to Mikes mail on allowing the Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC In my view instead of the Broker holding the same the AD himself can hold it on trust for EDVMHC But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank Authorised Dealer and as well at EDVMHC From Due Diligence and Compliance point of view i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank Account than the trust route Since it is not a demated shares opening of an custodial account is not required This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer F Application to RBI TS I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS it is advisable to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E above We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to a opening of an rupee account or b authorising the AD to hold the same in an trust account for EDVMHC RBI while according its approval will look in to the transaction and accord approval for this as well May be before filing the application with RBI we could meet with the concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest G Original Funds I understand that while making this investment the funds have not come in from EDVMHC Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands Tax need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco though on behalf of an Mauritius Company would qualify for tax benefits H Confirmation by Genesys on non Lockin There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify distinctive numbers of the Lockin Shares nor it is stated in the Information Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of the Promoters Quoto they are freely tradable it is advised that we take a certificate from Genesys on this I have spoken this with Rajesh who confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any difficulty Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end Regards Bhaskar Forwarded by Chandran BhaskarENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Sandeep Katwala PM To Chandran

approval Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required Clause B to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS form Please note that the TS form requires a CA certificate If we sell on an exchange through a broker clause B a i will apply Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held by the company there is time from when the sale order is given to the broker Clause provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the money to Mauritius Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause c Also it seems from Clause b that if we sell through the exchange then approval of RBI under the TS is not required for the repatriation Rahul

cc Subject Genesys Sale of Shares RBI approvall FYI It would seem we still have a lot of ground to cover on selling Genesys Forwarded by Lauren HagertyENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Chandran Bhaskar AM To Rahul BasuENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Sandeep KatwalaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Raj ThaparENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Gopalakrishnan SubramaniamENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Veena SrinivasanENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Lauren HagertyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Genesys Sale of Shares RBI approvall Dear Rahul Your mail on the above subject refers As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd Mauritius i list below the following A Approvals required Per section B the FEMA Regulations effective June transfer by way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares debentures held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI Veena your activity chart shows that Form TS is to be filed after the sale is effected money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds Since the Act prescribes prior approval we should sell only after receipt of RBI approval and not before The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement the application should be supported with the average quotation of the share price average of daily high and low for one week proceeding the date of application duly certified by a Chartered Accountant If the sale proposed to be effected on the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market price the Chartered Accountants certification is not required Since we intend selling at the floor this certification is not required B Thinly Traded I refer to Veenas query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded Per section Explanation i the share will be treated as thinly traded if the annualised trading turnover in that share on a main stock exchanges in India during the six calendar months preceding the month in which the application is made is less than by number of shares of the listed stock Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only from June it is to be noted that the new shares issued to a the erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of amalgamation approved by the High Court Mumbai b the applicants of the private placement incl Enron and the new amalgamated company Genesys International Corporation Limited whose previous name was Aeke Trading and Investments Limited was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange Hence it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded or not FYI the Paid Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was Equity Shares of Rs each aggregating Rs We can apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded It is better to check this provision C Formalities for remittance Per section of the FEMA Regulations remittance of sale proceeds shall be made by a authorised dealer upon satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation basis we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No SIANFC NRI to the AD submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and submission of a No Objection Certificate tax clearance certificate D Income Tax NoC TCC I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty we need not obtain the NoC of the IT In my view since the regulation stipulates an NoC TCC from the IT Department i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC TCC of the IT In the past this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificateconfirming there are no tax implications in the underlying transaction one could remit the funds without a NoCTCC from IT But given a very specific statement us of the FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from June and hasnt been time tested i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification In my view NoC would be a pre requisite E Bank Account Assuming that the NoC is required there will be a timing difference between we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after obtaining the NoC from IT It is certainly not advisable to hold the instrument without encashing it Hence opening of a Bank Account in India to encash the instrument is warranted I refer to Mikes mail on allowing the Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC In my view instead of the Broker holding the same the AD himself can hold it on trust for EDVMHC But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank Authorised Dealer and as well at EDVMHC From Due Diligence and Compliance point of view i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank Account than the trust route Since it is not a demated shares opening of an custodial account is not required This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer F Application to RBI TS I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS it is advisable to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E above We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to a opening of an rupee account or b authorising the AD to hold the same in an trust account for EDVMHC RBI while according its approval will look in to the transaction and accord approval for this as well May be before filing the application with RBI we could meet with the concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest G Original Funds I understand that while making this investment the funds have not come in from EDVMHC Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands Tax need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco though on behalf of an Mauritius Company would qualify for tax benefits H Confirmation by Genesys on non Lockin There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify distinctive numbers of the Lockin Shares nor it is stated in the Information Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of the Promoters Quoto they are freely tradable it is advised that we take a certificate from Genesys on this I have spoken this with Rajesh who confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any difficulty Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end Regards Bhaskar Forwarded by Chandran BhaskarENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Sandeep Katwala PM To Chandran

NRONDEVELOPMENT Rajesh AgarwalENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rajesh ShekharENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Sandeep KatwalaENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Raj ThaparENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Genesys Sale of Shares RBI approval Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required Clause B to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS form Please note that the TS form requires a CA certificate If we sell on an exchange through a broker clause B a i will apply Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held by the company there is time from when the sale order is given to the broker Clause provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the money to Mauritius Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause c Also it seems from Clause b that if we sell through the exchange then approval of RBI under the TS is not required for the repatriation Rahul

listed on Bombay Stock Exchange BSE on Monday June and is traded on the B group on the BSE under ticker code We have purchased shares at Rs per share total of Rs million The site for the BSE is wwwbseindiacom The shares are owned by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited Mauritius Based The physical share certificates are with Enron India in a vault in a bank There is no lock up restriction on the shares purchased by us and we are free to sell these shares I am not clear on the materal nonpublic information and who would need to give the certification Could you clarify where the requirement for the certification arises and send me a copy of the form of the certificate We would need a broker in India who is authorised to deal on the BSE to execute the transactions A person acting on behalf of Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited Mauritius would need to enter into the relevant agreements and authorisations I do not think that Goldman Sachs would be able to sell these shares on our behalf on the BSE as we would need a broker here in India to execute the deal Under Indian Regulations the proceeds from the sale of shares on behalf of the foriegn company needs to be deposited in a rupee bank account and then can be onward remitted to Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited account The bank has the responsibility of carrying out the due diligence for adherence to
