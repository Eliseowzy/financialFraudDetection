make a schedule Its important these clients meet SR management Id like to introduce you to the portfolio managers so they can explain the nature of their business and the potential for Enron which is great Of those we deal with we are doing of their business This is predominately gas but we are the best situated to do the same in power weather coal crudeproducts etc They want to understand our structure they have not met anyone SR in ENA since Jeff left We are losing business with new clients everyday because of the creditlegalbackoffice process I am bringing Bill Bradford around to meet the CFOs and port managers Mar and We currently have a log jam of clients to get through the creditlegal system We have one credit analyst working on our names but we share this person with many other groups In the months I have been covering these clients we have only gotten ISDAs signed and one we had been working on for a year prior to my arrival Credit will not allow us to trade without an ISDA even when their are no credit issues we do not take any exposure to these clients we MTM every day and in some cases call for a day VAR on the MTM amount this is typically how long it takes to get the MTM money in the door The legal side of this process is also extremely slow they are excellent once you get them focused on your work but due to all small number of them it takes weeks to get to the top of the chain These clients have special needs the deals they do are alocated to many accounts all these accounts must be set up in our system properly and the deals booked correctly accross all the trading areas This is a timely process with a lot of holes at present We do not have enough personnel dedicated to this process On a side note no ISDAs means that they can also not trade on EOL To date non of these clients have been able to trade on EOL although they are dying to Understanding of market fundamentals New business These clients deal with us because we understand the energy

the hedge funds with the least amount of extra work for you Ive had to scrap the group presentation idea since a few of the funds made it very clear to me that they would not feel comfortable asking questions with their competitors in the room So much for the easy road so this is what I propose there are key relationship funds we need to deliver to and have a working questionanswer session with Most are in the NY area we could do all the sessions in our office making the funds come into the city i think this will be good because if we get them away from the dayto day they focus better also we do not have to travel I am thinking either April or wedthursfri Well space out the presentations through the days over breakfasts and lunches When I know you are available Ill put a schedule together The hedge fund business is really taking off now and your continued support directly contributes to more QUALITY trading relationships and trades The feedback we have been getting from the funds is that they think Enron gets it in terms of our view of the markets trading style fundamental research and execution the banks just are not there thus they really want to do business with us In

Wednesday February PM To Lavorato John White Stacey Beck Sally Beth NRON Nat Steve Subject Potential Gas System Exposure For some period of time various West Power desks have been the default desk which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in TAGG I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West Power out of this problem Im happy with the result from the West Power point of view I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists If someone does a gas deal and hasnt set up a new book properly and doesnt carefully track hisher position the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages Days weeks or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain I think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before not the gas desk with the misplaced trade Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of hisher position is missing These are the facts

book solves the problem for us but not for Enron as a whole If no one monitors the dummy book on the daily basis which probably wont happen if there is no ownership then you still have the possibility

Valarie CT Samantha CT cc Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot do you guys agree Forwarded by Tim BeldenHOUECT on PM From Steve nronXgate on PM CST To Tim CT Stacey W CT cc Beth nronXgate Subject RE Remaining problem with West tot Tim The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the interface job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results tables If mapping logic is not set up for a new book the job was defaulting the gas deals to the STPLT desk The default mapping has been changed to a dummy ZZerms book which will prevent the deals from showing up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated In reference to Beths concerns turns out this was a limitation in our production code not an IT change to production data so we should be OK on that front The longterm solution would be to remove the hardcoded logic setup table structures and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen Given our other priorities and the default logic change we will not pursue this option Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns Steve Original Message From Belden Tim Sent Wednesday February AM To White Stacey Cc Perlman Beth Nat

not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as this would misrepresent the positions across the board The problem is that the position belongs to another book within Enpower The users

please see the attached for details Let me know if you require something further Forwarded by Rob MilnthorpCALECT on PM From Eric LeDain on AM To Rob CT cc Subject Extension of PetroCanada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for more years On Wednesday the President of PetroCanada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November for an incremental years This has taken me a a while to get closed and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service but keep in mind its not easy to renew something half way through the first term This extension is very significant for the following reasons It creates a MTM income of MM CDN net of directly attributable costs to provide the backoffice services It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income along with all the production information etc Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada As you know we have used the PetroCanada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for years but theyve liked it so much theyve already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations Accounting and IT staff that work with PetroCanada I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them It takes alot of effort to enchant the customer day after day year after year In fact its incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider The numbers Under the extension we have provided PetroCanada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee Original base fee is MM CDN per year payable monthly Rebate offered Jan Nov CDN Nov Nov CDN Fee charged for extension term Nov Nov CDN Nov Nov CDN Nov Nov CDN Nov Nov CDN Nov Nov CDN We have thoroughly defined our backoffice costs required to provide these services at CDNyr and have years of operating history to support this as a projection with escalation at per year for the second five year term These costs include backoffice staff allocations salaries and benefits and rentinfrastructure allocation We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow In discussions with Wes this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope will allow us to MTM this income The MTM income of MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term and has been reduced by the above annual costs Notes We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of have disappeared We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to If PetroCanadas sales volumes fall to of last years levels there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about of todays levels PetroCanada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected Volumes over the last months have increased by about year on year Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week
