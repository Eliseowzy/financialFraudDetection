Service XMSEmbeddedReport Thanks Dan Im having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have any choice other than to vigorously and respectfully decline to offer up any contracts and assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attempt to impose any quid pro quo ie forcing folks to waive their due process rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl Best Jeff Original Message From

Karen Shea Jim Crossen Dasovich Jeff Janie Mollon Jack Pigott Greg Blue George Vaughn Gary Ackerman Ed Cazalet Denice Cazalet Purdum Curtis Kebler Curt Hatton Corby Gardiner Charles Miessner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Alden Hoekstra Max Bulk Cc Gregg Klatt Ed Duncan Fairchild Tracy Subject IMPORTANT Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commission by December The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who sign a suitable protective order The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow By December any party who believes that it has a direct access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direct access as of July or a date earlier than September shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order A failure to submit this information for the Commissions consideration will be considered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts and agreements Initially the true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commissions Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge ALJ Robert Barnett Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff which shall be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission staff by December Parties supplemental comments to the comments they filed in response to the October rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by January As a preliminary matter of course AReM and WPTF do not in their own names have direct access contracts However certain members of AReM and WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they wish to take The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds I will be considering our options and get back to you with more detail However as a very preliminary analysis it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over either ESPs or the customers they serve The request is also particularly outrageous because of the statements that A failure to submit this information for the Commissions consideration will be considered a waiver of the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements and Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and agreements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreements are in effect The former is a likely denial of due process and the latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitors and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energydependent customers Your thoughts would be appreciated My initial reaction is that this is time for ESPs and customer groups such as CMTA ABAG CLECA CIU EPUC SPURR etc to band together and fight this at multiple levels from the Governors Office on down including in the media Your thoughts would be very much appreciated Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel Fax mailto This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant
