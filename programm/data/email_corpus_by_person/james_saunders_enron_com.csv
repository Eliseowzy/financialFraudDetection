relatively quickly We have an enterprise issue localized in ETS if that helps getting any action Fundamentally through my recent investigation I have become acquainted with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues with little apparent solution to date The items are being worked Composite depreciation is not correct millions of SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module the FERC trial balance does NOT balance Labor distribution trueups are not correct for FERC purposes costs are being misallocated this was originally deemed a show stopper AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies FERC ledgers are not available FERC Users were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that opportunity was nixed by the decisions below We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes Benefits have been charged out incorrectly nearly resolved Anxiety issue We have little confidence well be able to efficiently prepare timely year end FERC Form reports for Enron pipelines submission deadlines for which are well before any Project Sunrise timetable there is voluminous revenuevolume financial property and tax related data required for this document all of which has to be stated in FERC format Rod Hayslett PM To Melissa NRON cc James NRON Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this or because I have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on this The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution merely means I have to find one since I dont have the option of saying its too hard or the system cant do it On the other hand Im sure I dont know all the answers so Im not sure of what the right process even is Mark CT PM To Rod NRON James NRON Melissa NRON David NRON Ozlem ES Sheila NRON cc Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse To all Hope this clarifies We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle Preliminarily the interviews confirm our suspicions Cost PL reporting is the most widely held concern Cash flow reporting treasury direct indirect follows closely There is no easy readily available solution to FERC reporting People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of SAP Project Sunrises reporting charter will be to address these needs in the most efficient cost effective way possible That could be through a data warehouse could be through the FERC SAP module could be through another avenue None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet although we all have ideas I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan We have followup interviews to schedule complete a data model to build etc Basically a lot of work on our plates However FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the forefront of any reporting solution If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow Im all for it I need the education If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution we should look to postpone I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress but believe the delay worthwhile One final issue Sean the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the project is in California We may want to wait on his

Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse I feel we should proceed with the Dec meeting at least to get a better understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC and maybe determine just how far along it currently is The original reason we were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work had already been completed and it wouldnt take much to deliver an end product The other attendees as well as myself need to understand what this can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP Melissa Becker PM To Rod NRON James NRON cc Sheila NRON Mark CT David NRON Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate In addtion to Project Sunrise I have asked Sheila Howard who is the lead for the financial team in the ISC to work with the Project Sunrise team to understand what your issues are and help determine a solution Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC we are working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen As a matter of fact Project Sunrise had a status meeting today and this came up several times I think the only question is whats the best approach for solving it I will leave it to Dave as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise along with Sheila Mark and the others listed below to continue to work on a solution for the FERC problems Dave is there any reason NOT to proceed with the December meeting under these assumptions I would just ask that Sheila be included Thanks Rod Hayslett AM To Melissa NRON cc Subject Re FERC Data

relatively quickly We have an enterprise issue localized in ETS if that helps getting any action Fundamentally through my recent investigation I have become acquainted with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues with little apparent solution to date The items are being worked Composite depreciation is not correct millions of SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module the FERC trial balance does NOT balance Labor distribution trueups are not correct for FERC purposes costs are being misallocated this was originally deemed a show stopper AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies FERC ledgers are not available FERC Users were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that opportunity was nixed by the decisions below We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes Benefits have been charged out incorrectly nearly resolved Anxiety issue We have little confidence well be able to efficiently prepare timely year end FERC Form reports for Enron pipelines submission deadlines for which are well before any Project Sunrise timetable there is voluminous revenuevolume financial property and tax related data required for this document all of which has to be stated in FERC format Rod Hayslett PM To Melissa NRON cc James NRON Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this or because I have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on this The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution merely means I have to find one since I dont have the option of saying its too hard or the system cant do it On the other hand Im sure I dont know all the answers so Im not sure of what the right process even is Mark CT PM To Rod NRON James NRON Melissa NRON David NRON Ozlem ES Sheila NRON cc Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse To all Hope this clarifies We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle Preliminarily the interviews confirm our suspicions Cost PL reporting is the most widely held concern Cash flow reporting treasury direct indirect follows closely There is no easy readily available solution to FERC reporting People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of SAP Project Sunrises reporting charter will be to address these needs in the most efficient cost effective way possible That could be through a data warehouse could be through the FERC SAP module could be through another avenue None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet although we all have ideas I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan We have followup interviews to schedule complete a data model to build etc Basically a lot of work on our plates However FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the forefront of any reporting solution If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow Im all for it I need the education If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution we should look to postpone I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress but believe the delay worthwhile One final issue Sean the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the project is in California We may want to wait on his

Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse I feel we should proceed with the Dec meeting at least to get a better understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC and maybe determine just how far along it currently is The original reason we were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work had already been completed and it wouldnt take much to deliver an end

your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen As a matter of fact Project Sunrise had a status meeting today and this came up several times I think the only question is whats the best approach for solving it I will leave it to Dave as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise along with Sheila Mark and the others listed below to continue to work on a solution for the FERC problems

SentWednesday October PM ToWaymire Dave Gilbert Steve Saunders James CcCentilli James McCarty Danny Neubauer Dave Brassfield Morris SubjectRE Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal that we should probably charge someone else about as well Think abo ut it is only after tax Has some one enumerated the risks and v alued them on this deal I havent seen any of that work if it has been done I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goa l line return with little or no expense up front I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a num ber of years Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever Alternatively why dont we go through GSS Global Strategic Sourcing to l ook for a better deal Jim Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side Why can t I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense ov er the life of the deal Original Message From Waymire Dave SentWednesday October AM ToHayslett Rod Gilbert Steve CcCentilli James SubjectRE Redfield Deliverability Project Rod Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei r original levels The work overs are planned over a year period and a re expected to have a lasting effect of at least years The cost to mod el and rework these wells is estimated to be MM A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of If the test program did not prove out t he project would be terminated at this point The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment This would result as Kent ha s indicated negative EBIT for the first years As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f ield Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s pend an additional MM on a total of well workovers in the first y ears of the contract NNG currently budgets per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability Operations has c ommitted per year in well maintenance over the next years to thi s project for a total of MM Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer but has indicated that they would require a to return for assuming the financing Hallibu rton indicated that this is a nonstandard deal for them and that is the re ason for high return requirement The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate Even at an estimated return prelimi nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b etween to the first years and to for the out years Original Message From Hayslett Rod SentFriday October AM ToGilbert Steve CcWaymire Dave SubjectRE Redfield Deliverability Project Couple of quick comments Prepaying as an expense would require coming u p with some income to offset and generally doesnt make economic sense An Enron company cant help because it consolidates and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do What accountants have revi ewed the proposal Original Message From Miller Kent SentThursday October AM ToHayslett Rod McCarty Danny CcWaymire Dave Neubauer Dave Neville Sue Thomas Steve SubjectRedfield Deliverability Project Rod We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen ts at Redfield through the use of improved technology related to identifyi ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation This proj ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s tandpoint Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte d Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec onomics and have shown that the project has a great return in excess of Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all OM expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first y ears of the project We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen ses such that they come in over a year period so we dont have this negative IBIT flow in the first years however Halliburton has not been in terested and has proposed a finance charge for this structure What would be the appetite for possibly prepaying a majority of these cost s in to avoid the negative and earnings impact or is there an E nron company that would financeextend the expense payments This is a gre at project that we should do however it is difficult given the negative e arnings impacts in the first couple of years Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle
