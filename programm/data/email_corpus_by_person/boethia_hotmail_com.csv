Werkheiser Emily Pacheco Carolyn Richardson Kayla Pacheco Torrey Hukill Tyler Hukill Woody Berry Mike Stevens Subject President Bush Date Sat Oct A friend of mine sent this to me It is well worth your time to read and pray President Bush This was the same man who came within a hairs breadth of losing an election in November who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic machine to fix the vote count This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger years and whose happygolucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in college and an illfated oil venture This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father and whose speaking missteps became known as Bushisms And on Friday this was the man who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation with dignity class confidence appropriate solemnity and even muchneeded wit One thing struck me during the campaign that difficult rollercoaster campaign that now seems years ago It was that George W Bush never seemed to get ruffled Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or the sudden some would say vicious release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at a key moment W did not lose his cool At times his staff seemed overconfident as did many of us A electoralvote win they quietly implied and we optimistically believed Then they counted the votes miscounted others and recounted still others At the end he was still there Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed trying to gin up something out of nothing Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch He didnt do nothing that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man confusing lack of bluster for absence of action No his team of attorneys and the ironwilled James Baker were carrying out his orders but W stayed in the background confident and faithful You see it is this faith business that confounded everyone We have had such actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever anyone used the term faith But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the Lord of his life on public TV Not an oblique reference to being bornagain or having a life change He said the unPClike phrase Jesus Christ to which his handlers and advisors no doubt off stage were also saying Jesus Christ in a much different tone God has a way of honoring those who honor Him David learned that while he was on the run from Sauls armies Job learned that after his time of horrible tribulation The Messiah said so Himself many times So this was the man who actually put faith into practice He actually loves those who hate him It is a staggering concept so foreign in daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding Even one of Ws biggest supporters chided the President for adhering to his new tone Yet there he was again and again thanking the Democrats Appointing his enemies to high places in his government Inviting his former foes and their wives to private movie screenings and I know this is hard to stomach even treating them with dignity See this was the man who learned early on how faith worked by praying for his enemies you heap burning coals upon their heads This was the man who named the absolute top people in national security and defense then caught barbs from the politically righteous that this one didnt have the right views on abortion or that one didnt have the right position on guns And on September at midmorning this was the man thrust into a position only known by Roosevelt Churchill Lincoln and Washington The weight of the world was on his shoulders and the responsibility of a generation was on his soul So this same manthe one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish with charges of illegitimacy and the one whose political opponents desperately sought to stonewall until midterm electionswalked to his seat at the front of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive symbols of American capitalism and prosperity virtually evaporated along with perhaps thousands of Americans As he sat down next to his wife immediately I knew that even if his faith ever faltered hers didnt I have never seen a more peaceful face than Laura Bush whose eyes seemed as though they were already gazing at the final outcome not just of this conflict but of her reward in Heaven itself In this marriage you indeed got two for the price of one Then came the defining moment of our generation Some people fondly recall their Woodstock days Others mark with grim sadness November as the day America lost her innocence But I firmly believe when the history of this time is written it will be acknowledged by friend and foe alike that President George W Bush came of age in that cathedral and lifted a nation off its knees It wasnt so much his words though read a decade later they will indeed be as stirring as any This conflict would end he noted at a time of our choosing It certainly wasnt his emotion What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of selfcontrol in presidential history W was able to deliver his remarks without losing either his resolve or his focus or more important his confidence It was as if Gods hand which had guided him through that sliverthin election now rested fully on him His quiet confidence let our enemies know and believe me they know that they made a grave miscalculation Now this same man who practiced his faith through a tough election who steeled his convictions even more in a drawnout Florida battle and who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with his foes well ok maybe the Clymer comment is an exception this same man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a generation and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were another unpleasant duty As he walked back to his seat the camera angle was appropriate He was virtually alone in the scene alone in that massive place of God just him and the Lord But thats the way its always been in his life recently In that brief time it took him to return to his seat I believe he heard words to the effect of You can do this George I am with you always And you can do this well because I am going before you And dont worry about the weight Ive got it And I saw in his eyes a quiet acknowledgement I know Thank you Lord Back at his seat when W sat down George H W Bush reached over and took his sons hand The elder Bush always struck me as a religious man but not someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the Lord George H W treats the Father like a respected uncle visiting Him on appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real but not constant Anyway I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H W said I wish I could do this for you son but I cant You have to do this on your own W squeezed back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept throughout It said I dont have to do it alone dad Ive got help What a blessing to have a professing Christian as President one who is not ashamed to admit it Please take a moment after you read this to pray for him he truly does have the weight of the world on his shoulders Pray that God will sustain him and give him wisdom and discernment in his decisions Make no mistake about it the decisions he makes in the coming days weeks and months will literally define the future of our country and the free world Pray for his protection and that of his family After you have prayed send this to everyone on your email list Our President needs Christians around the world to be praying for him As this makes the email rounds eventually there could literally be people praying for him He needs it John K OwensGet more from the Web FREE MSN Explorer download Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at intlasp Yahoo Groups Sponsor FREE COLLEGE MONEY CLICK HERE to search
