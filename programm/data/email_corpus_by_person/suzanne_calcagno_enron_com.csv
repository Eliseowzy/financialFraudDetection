have any questions or need additional informationSMC NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Williams MarketLink Phase Is Open for Business Williams said Wednesday that it has completed the first phase of the Transco pipeline systems MarketLink expansion project which will provide much needed incremental natural gas transportation capacity into the northeastern United States The company added that this project represents the first interstate pipeline expansion completed to serve the New York metropolitan area since Williams Gas PipelineTransco has provided reliable economic gas transportation services to the Northeast for over years and is committed to meeting the growing energy requirements in the region said Gary Lauderdale senior vice president and general manager Williams Transco pipeline This area which includes Pennsylvania New Jersey and New York continues to experience a need for additional natural gas to serve residential commercial and power generation facilities MarketLink will help meet this need The MarketLink project which received the goahead from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on April is being constructed in two phases The first phase was completed and entered into service on Wednesday It will deliver an incremental Dthd of natural gas The second phase of the project which will be placed in service in November will deliver an additional Dthd to the region Phase of MarketLink will provide much needed capacity to the region in time for the winter heating season said Mario DiCocco Williams Transco pipeline director of operations for the Princeton division which covers New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania We will begin construction of Phase II next spring Williams pointed out that there are more than a dozen new gasfueled power plants currently in the permitting process in New Jersey alone Gas transported by MarketLink is expected to fuel new efficient power plants that are needed to meet the regions growing electricity needs and help meet Clean Air Act standards NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Islander East Receives FERCs Preliminary Determination The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues to the Islander East Pipeline Co LLC to build a mile pipeline that will bring natural gas from Connecticut to Long Island NY Duke Energy Gas Transmission DEGT and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island KEDLI first announced its plans for the proposed line in January The proposed pipeline project will be equally owned by the two companies under Islander East Pipeline LLC Originating from DEGTs Algonquin Gas Transmissions system the pipeline made from inch and inch diameter pipe would extend from Connecticut across Long Island Sound to Wading River NY and other points on Long Island where it would connect with KEDLI The companies believe the time is right for Islander East because it would have access to almost every major supply basin in North America including the recently developed Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia in Atlantic Canada Its backers said it would be possible through Algonquins proposed interconnection with Maritimes Northeast Pipeline The companies said that they expect to have the pipeline operating in initially providing Dthd of natural gas to the Long Island and New York City energy markets enough to heat homes However the Islander East project is not the only game in town Following the Islander announcement El Paso Corps Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co revealed a project that would provide up to Dthd of new transportation capacity from the companys interconnection with joint facilities of Maritimes Northeast Pipeline LLC and Portland Natural Gas Transmission System Co in Dracut MA and terminate in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island Tennessee said its project will deliver to various local distribution companies and their facilities including Yankee Gas Services Connecticut Natural Gas Southern Connecticut Gas and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island as well as directly to proposed power generating plants along the way Also throwing its hat into the ring back in April Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP announced an open season yesterday for Zone firm transportation capacity for delivery on its proposed Eastern Long Island Expansion Iroquois proposes to construct miles of inch diameter marine pipeline from Milford CT to Shoreham Long Island and points farther inland as the market demands NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Maritimes Phase III HubLine Iroquois Eastchester Receive Final FERC Nods FERC issued final certificates Wednesday morning to the Maritimes Northeast Pipeline Phase III expansion project and related HubLine expansion by Algonquin Gas Transmission The integrated expansions will increase transportation of Atlantic Canadian gas to the Boston area In addition Iroquois Eastchester project received a final green light from FERC The million Eastchester project will add Dthd of capacity to the Iroquois system to increase deliveries mainly to New York City power generators The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied rolledin rate treatment for Eastchester stating that contrary to Iroquois claims the projects cost actually would exceed its revenues requiring existing firm shippers to subsidize a portion of the project Iroquois had said the project would provide million in annual net financial benefits but FERC found that it actually would cost existing shippers million As a result the Commission left the rates to be settled in a future proceeding The mile pipeline extension will connect Iroquois existing system in Suffolk County with Consolidated Edisons system in the Bronx Iroquois hopes to complete the extension by November It signed year precedent agreements for the capacity with five shippers Virginia Power Energy Marketing Dthd Mirant New York Management KeySpan Ravenswood Consolidated Edison Energy and Orion Power Holdings ConEd KeySpan and Orion will use their capacity to serve power generation load FERC also said the pipeline must finalize its agreements with shippers prior to moving forward with construction Iroquois Gas Transmission System is a partnership of US and Canadian energy firms and is owner of a mile interstate pipeline extending from the USCanadian border at Waddington NY through western Connecticut to Long Island NY The companion expansion projects of Maritimes Northeast and Algonquin call for Maritimes to construct an extension in a southeasterly direction through several Massachusetts counties to the East Coast where a new Algonquin line would connect and extend offshore down the coast through Boston Bay to a connection with Algonquins existing system at Weymouth on the south side of Boston Harbor The two pipeline projects are designed to supply up to Dthd to the gasstarved New England region and are targeted for service by November The socalled Phase III extension of the mile Maritimes pipeline which imports Atlantic Canadian gas to the Northeast from the Sable Offshore Energy Project offshore Nova Scotia will include miles of inch diameter pipeline and one mile of inch diameter pipeline extending from Methuen MA through a number of counties to a connection with Algonquins proposed extension in Beverly MA The project which has an estimated price tag of million would provide firm transportation service to serve growing markets on the east end of Algonquins system Algonquins HubLine project which has a projected cost of million will include about miles of inch diameter pipeline extending offshore from an interconnection near Beverly with Maritimes proposed Phase III project to an interconnection with Algonquins existing I lateral in Weymouth Algonquin also plans to build a mile inch diameter lateral from the proposed pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant owned by Massachusetts Water Resources Authority on Deer Island

in the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said

have any questions or need additional informationSMC NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Williams MarketLink Phase Is Open for Business Williams said Wednesday that it has completed the first phase of the Transco pipeline systems MarketLink expansion project which will provide much needed incremental natural gas transportation capacity into the northeastern United States The company added that this project represents the first interstate pipeline expansion completed to serve the New York metropolitan area since Williams Gas PipelineTransco has provided reliable economic gas transportation services to the Northeast for over years and is committed to meeting the growing energy requirements in the region said Gary Lauderdale senior vice president and general manager Williams Transco pipeline This area which includes Pennsylvania New Jersey and New York continues to experience a need for additional natural gas to serve residential commercial and power generation facilities MarketLink will help meet this need The MarketLink project which received the goahead from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on April is being constructed in two phases The first phase was completed and entered into service on Wednesday It will deliver an incremental Dthd of natural gas The second phase of the project which will be placed in service in November will deliver an additional Dthd to the region Phase of MarketLink will provide much needed capacity to the region in time for the winter heating season said Mario DiCocco Williams Transco pipeline director of operations for the Princeton division which covers New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania We will begin construction of Phase II next spring Williams pointed out that there are more than a dozen new gasfueled power plants currently in the permitting process in New Jersey alone Gas transported by MarketLink is expected to fuel new efficient power plants that are needed to meet the regions growing electricity needs and help meet Clean Air Act standards NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Islander East Receives FERCs Preliminary Determination The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC issued a preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues to the Islander East Pipeline Co LLC to build a mile pipeline that will bring natural gas from Connecticut to Long Island NY Duke Energy Gas Transmission DEGT and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island KEDLI first announced its plans for the proposed line in January The proposed pipeline project will be equally owned by the two companies under Islander East Pipeline LLC Originating from DEGTs Algonquin Gas Transmissions system the pipeline made from inch and inch diameter pipe would extend from Connecticut across Long Island Sound to Wading River NY and other points on Long Island where it would connect with KEDLI The companies believe the time is right for Islander East because it would have access to almost every major supply basin in North America including the recently developed Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia in Atlantic Canada Its backers said it would be possible through Algonquins proposed interconnection with Maritimes Northeast Pipeline The companies said that they expect to have the pipeline operating in initially providing Dthd of natural gas to the Long Island and New York City energy markets enough to heat homes However the Islander East project is not the only game in town Following the Islander announcement El Paso Corps Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co revealed a project that would provide up to Dthd of new transportation capacity from the companys interconnection with joint facilities of Maritimes Northeast Pipeline LLC and Portland Natural Gas Transmission System Co in Dracut MA and terminate in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island Tennessee said its project will deliver to various local distribution companies and their facilities including Yankee Gas Services Connecticut Natural Gas Southern Connecticut Gas and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island as well as directly to proposed power generating plants along the way Also throwing its hat into the ring back in April Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP announced an open season yesterday for Zone firm transportation capacity for delivery on its proposed Eastern Long Island Expansion Iroquois proposes to construct miles of inch diameter marine pipeline from Milford CT to Shoreham Long Island and points farther inland as the market demands NGIs Daily Gas Price Index published December Maritimes Phase III HubLine Iroquois Eastchester Receive Final FERC Nods FERC issued final certificates Wednesday morning to the Maritimes Northeast Pipeline Phase III expansion project and related HubLine expansion by Algonquin Gas Transmission The integrated expansions will increase transportation of Atlantic Canadian gas to the Boston area In addition Iroquois Eastchester project received a final green light from FERC The million Eastchester project will add Dthd of capacity to the Iroquois system to increase deliveries mainly to New York City power generators The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied rolledin rate treatment for Eastchester stating that contrary to Iroquois claims the projects cost actually would exceed its revenues requiring existing firm shippers to subsidize a portion of the project Iroquois had said the project would provide million in annual net financial benefits but FERC found that it actually would cost existing shippers million As a result the Commission left the rates to be settled in a future proceeding The mile pipeline extension will connect Iroquois existing system in Suffolk County with Consolidated Edisons system in the Bronx Iroquois hopes to complete the extension by November It signed year precedent agreements for the capacity with five shippers Virginia Power Energy Marketing Dthd Mirant New York Management KeySpan Ravenswood Consolidated Edison Energy and Orion Power Holdings ConEd KeySpan and Orion will use their capacity to serve power generation load FERC also said the pipeline must finalize its agreements with shippers prior to moving forward with construction Iroquois Gas Transmission System is a partnership of US and Canadian energy firms and is owner of a mile interstate pipeline extending from the USCanadian border at Waddington NY through western Connecticut to Long Island NY The companion expansion projects of Maritimes Northeast and Algonquin call for Maritimes to construct an extension in a southeasterly direction through several Massachusetts counties to the East Coast where a new Algonquin line would connect and extend offshore down the coast through Boston Bay to a connection with Algonquins existing system at Weymouth on the south side of Boston Harbor The two pipeline projects are designed to supply up to Dthd to the gasstarved New England region and are targeted for service by November The socalled Phase III extension of the mile Maritimes pipeline which imports Atlantic Canadian gas to the Northeast from the Sable Offshore Energy Project offshore Nova Scotia will include miles of inch diameter pipeline and one mile of inch diameter pipeline extending from Methuen MA through a number of counties to a connection with Algonquins proposed extension in Beverly MA The project which has an estimated price tag of million would provide firm transportation service to serve growing markets on the east end of Algonquins system Algonquins HubLine project which has a projected cost of million will include about miles of inch diameter pipeline extending offshore from an interconnection near Beverly with Maritimes proposed Phase III project to an interconnection with Algonquins existing I lateral in Weymouth Algonquin also plans to build a mile inch diameter lateral from the proposed pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant owned by Massachusetts Water Resources Authority on Deer Island

the Texas Gas cashout proceeding Transco is saying they wont implement prior to April but havent decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m its likely that the dollars will be subject to the ongoing negotiations taking place in Transcos RP rate case proceeding Ill coordinate with Tammy to insure that weve got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes On Texas Gas this represents a minor win for uswe had argued that Texas Gas proposal was not consistent with Order and that they should adopt a more Transcolike scheme that creates uncertainty wo creating undue penalties Texas Gas will have to refile well have another goround between the marketing companiesproducers and the LDCs on the Texas Gas system Will keep you posted Please let me know if you have any questions Suzanne x TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT LINE SYSTEM OTHER RATE CHANGES Capping a longrunning debate over the Line proposal Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from FERC to implement a new online interactive computer system Last months ruling also went a long way toward completing Transcos effort to comply with orders and The Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos Inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and According to Transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transcos proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how Line complies with orders and IF April Looking at the Line plan from an order and perspective FERC in the Sept order RP et al found most of the scheme to its liking It accepted Transcos proposal to change the capacityrelease bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill The commission approved Transcos proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity To raise its comfort level about the provision FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shippers nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shippers ability to specify when the release will become effective FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims In response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transcos affiliates as well On order matters FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transcos positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing FERC was less enthused with Transcos preferred approach to interaction between the pipelines segmentation and discounting policies Refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shippers right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours FERC also accepted Transcos existing imbalance cashout tolerances and tiered cashout mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties The pipeline has not adequately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on noncritical days said the commission FERC rejected Transcos proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges The commission ruled that Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue But the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances FERC said that it is not clear from Transcos explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of highlow daily pricing for cashouts The revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system FERC said To stop customers from gaming its system Texas Gas in March proposed RP a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pooltopool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price Seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that Texas Gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided However FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily highlow index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order The order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate For instance Texas Gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance FERC said
