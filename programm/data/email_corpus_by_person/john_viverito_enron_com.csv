utilizing the term Business Model Patent If you believe it appropriate perhaps you could clarify this with him I note that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a conference call that was in progress The question that Jae Moo had raised was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be categorized as a commodity derivative as opposed to a financial derivative I informed the participants on the call that in Japan weather derivatives are considered financial in nature most analagous under the Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions The basis for this is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather derivative as would be possible in a commodity type transaction therefore resulting in the classification of a financial derivative If I may be of further assistance please contact me My office phone number in Tokyo is Cheers John Matthias CT AM To Alan CT Mark CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Edmund CT John nron cc Angeline CT Subject Meeting with Kim Chang EOL Korean legal survey Alan MarkDavid John Edmund I had a telephone conference with Kim ChangEnron Korea this afternoon The meeting was initiated by Mike Dahlke APACHI Regulatory Affairs and Jae Moo Lee Enron Korea Attendence Mike Dahlke Enron Jae Moo Lee Enron Michelle Lee Enron Matt Lee Enron by telephone SK Hong Kim Chang Summary of issues discussed Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or received Financial Derivatives are not defined Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for each trade Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of Korea for each trade Failure to make report or obtain approval means the Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment Bank of Korea has informally advised KC that for Commodity Derivatives the report can be made by the foreign counterparty ie Enron and notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report can be done as soon as possible after the trade confirmation However Bank of Korea has the discretion to reject any report made This would make a trade effectively unperformable or unenforceable Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April and informally informed KC that they have yet to receive a single report Prior to April reports were made to certain designated banks KC advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty it would have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is hedging but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign copunterparty makes the report I am of the opinion that this statement should be viewed with caution especially since there is really no expereince in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea For Financial Derivatives prior approval is required before a trade is done and may take to days The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean entities In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified KC recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation The Ministry of Finance and Economy which is the legislative authority may have to be approached if Bank of Korea is unableunwilling to make a decision Such lobbying is likely to be protracted I have asked KC to make informal enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives and whether it would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives KC also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather Derivatives KC was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company out to make lots of money Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan which he had spoken with John V about John could you fill me in in case applicable to Korea It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting toapproval from Bank of Korea The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives potentially offered out of Enron Japan The Korean regulations do not seem to accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading let alone instantaneous online derivative trading Please advise next steps in particular do the commercial guys want to proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated Meanwhile I attach my comments and queries of KCs memorandum for your review Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for me to revert to KC Regards Matt

future reference my office number is Ill try to give you a ring Wednesday morning Houston time to discuss the going forward strategy Attached hereto are the draft documents modified in accordance with your commentsquestions and my responsive comments which are set forth below in red Look forward to seeing you soon Hi Susan Please review the attached documents from the tax perspective Thanks Best regards John Mark CT PM To John nron cc Subject Japanese ISDA Documents Dear John So sorry for the delay I hope it hasnt caused too much inconvenience No problem I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I dont have your phone number Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent Part b In our other derivatives trading the cross default test applies to Enron Corp with a Threshold of US To accomplish this in the schedule Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly The Schedule has been revised Please advise if the equivalent change should be made to paragraph bivB of paragraph of the CSA Part d Has Baker McKenzie recommended this We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation ie the outstanding transactions terminate automatically leaving us with an open unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it In the US the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge According to BM the ability to setoff against Japanese counterparties is limited by certain laws relating to insolvency including the Bankruptcy Law These laws give a trustee the right to cherry pick contracts Accordingly it is the general practice in Japan for parties to elect automatic early termination to ensure that close out netting takes place before the trustees right to cherry pick comes into effect In December a netting law came into effect in Japan which specifically permits close out netting notwithstanding the trustees right to cherry pick The netting law only applies where one of the parties to the transaction is a financial institution Mitsui Marine and Fire Sanwa and IBJ would all qualify From a legal perspective it is now arguable that automatic early termination should not be adopted for the same reasons as are described in you message However as a matter of Japanese market practice BM has advised that most schedules with Japanese counterparties still specify automatic early termination Accordingly the automatic early termination provision in place Please confirm that this is acceptable Please also note that the automatic early termination provision will be necessary when Enron Japan deals with Japanese corporations that are not financial institutions Part e We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the nondefaulting party the most flexibility Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature However in many of the markets where we operate quotations will not be available where they are available they may well not be meaningful and the Loss method gives flexibility while still requiring commercial reasonableness The Schedule has been revised Part hix This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex When we have the ability to ask for or be asked for collateral in the case of a downgrading we build that event into the Paragraph to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position If the party fails it then becomes a default allowing termination The Schedule has been revised Part hx Wouldnt the cross default be triggered before this could happen BM has advised that although the cross default provisions may well be triggered before this clause applies the clause is standard in Japan and is not detrimental to Enron therefore the clause has been left in place Part Have our internal Tax people approved this I have copied Susan Musch on this email so that she may review the documents for tax purposes Part I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to Since Enron Corp will be a Credit Support Provider does it have a Representative Director etc The clause has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection with the Enron Corp guarantee Please fill in the blanks to specify the appropriate documents Sorry for the oversight The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary In many nonUS jurisdictions local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval in others derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents etc BM has stated that in practice they have never been given or asked to review a Japanese law opinion in relation to a specific ISDA schedule entered into by a Japanese counterparty and would expect Japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions Part b gh These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind although they may be helpful for other reasons as well If neither party is in the US the CFTC reason may go away On the other hand since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well If that is our theory there are additional representations the Eligible Swap Participant reps that we should think about putting back in These representations were tailored with the Japanese prohibition on gambling in mind I was not able to find the eligible swap participant representation in the Enron US ISDA Form although there is a reference to this in the opinion Please inform me as to the wording that needs to be added for New York purposes Part d We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA definitions While I think we will get there we havent actually made the decision yet So far I guess we leave it the way it is OK Part j My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about For the swap counterparties currently being considered by Enron Mitsui Marine IBJ and Sanwa no guarantees are being required BM has advised the form of the Enron Corp guarantee would generally be acceptable for guaranteeing the obligations of Japanese counterparties However there are a number of changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and jurisdiction provisions to Japan for ease of enforcement against parties whose principal assets are located in Japan It is recommended that the guarantee be reviewed in further detail before it is actually proposed to counterparties Paragraph I have to admit Im not as familiar with the Paragraph provisions as the Schedule My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like theres a glitch in the form It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the major agencies we shouldnt be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us The way it is drafted now if either SP or Moodys stops rating us even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur The counterparty doesnt have to worry about Moodys at all Just a thought The suggested change has been made Additionally the provision has been modified to provide that a MAC will occur with respect to Enron only if both rating agencies downgrade Enron Corp Please confirm this is OK On the guaranty you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp Legal My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher in this case maybe an extra than the threshold in the CSA that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded I will separately forward the guaranty to Clement Abrams for his approval The cap has been increased to US Tana is preparing a redline for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but dont expect many I apologize that the redline was not fully made against the US form I hope this is helpful Mark This has been very helpful Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things All excellent ideas Were looking forward to having you back Looking forward to seeing you soon Thanks again

counterparties is limited by certain laws relating to insolvency including the Bankruptcy Law These laws give a trustee the right to cherry pick contracts Accordingly it is the general practice in Japan for parties to elect automatic early termination to ensure that close out netting takes place before the trustees right to cherry pick comes into effect In December a netting law came into effect in Japan which specifically permits close out netting notwithstanding the trustees right to cherry pick The netting law only applies where one of the parties to the transaction is a financial institution Mitsui Marine and Fire Sanwa and IBJ would all qualify From a legal perspective it is now arguable that automatic early termination should not be adopted for the same reasons as are described in you message However as a matter of Japanese market practice BM has advised that most schedules with Japanese counterparties still specify automatic early termination Accordingly the automatic early termination provision in place Please confirm that this is acceptable Please also note that the automatic early termination provision will be necessary when Enron Japan deals with Japanese corporations that are not financial institutions Part e We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the nondefaulting party the most flexibility Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature However in many of the markets where we operate quotations will not be available where they are available they may well not be meaningful and the Loss method gives flexibility while still requiring commercial reasonableness The Schedule has been revised Part hix This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex When we have the ability to ask for or be asked for collateral in the case of a downgrading we build that event into the Paragraph to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position If the party fails it then becomes a default allowing termination The Schedule has been revised Part hx Wouldnt the cross default be triggered before this could happen BM has advised that although the cross default provisions may well be triggered before this clause applies the clause is standard in Japan and is not detrimental to Enron therefore the clause has been left in place Part Have our internal Tax people approved this I have copied Susan Musch on this email so that she may review the documents for tax purposes Part I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to Since Enron Corp will be a Credit Support Provider does it have a Representative Director etc The clause has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection with the Enron Corp guarantee Please fill in the blanks to specify the appropriate documents Sorry for the oversight The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary In many nonUS jurisdictions local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval in others derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents etc BM has stated that in practice they have never been given or asked to review a Japanese law opinion in relation to a specific ISDA schedule entered into by a Japanese counterparty and would expect Japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions Part b gh These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind although they may be helpful for other reasons as well If neither party is in the US the CFTC reason may go away On the other hand since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well If that is our theory there are additional representations the Eligible Swap Participant reps that we should think about putting back in These representations were tailored with the Japanese prohibition on gambling in mind I was not able to find the eligible swap participant representation in the Enron US ISDA Form although there is a reference to this in the opinion Please inform me as to the wording that needs to be added for New York purposes Part d We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA definitions While I think we will get there we havent actually made the decision yet So far I guess we leave it the way it is OK Part j My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about For the swap counterparties currently being considered by Enron Mitsui Marine IBJ and Sanwa no guarantees are being required BM has advised the form of the Enron Corp guarantee would generally be acceptable for guaranteeing the obligations of Japanese counterparties However there are a number of changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and jurisdiction provisions to Japan for ease of enforcement against parties whose principal assets are located in Japan It is recommended that the guarantee be reviewed in further detail before it is actually proposed to counterparties Paragraph I have to admit Im not as familiar with the Paragraph provisions as the Schedule My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like theres a glitch in the form It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the major agencies we shouldnt be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us The way it is drafted now if either SP or Moodys stops rating us even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur The counterparty doesnt have to worry about Moodys at all Just a thought The suggested change has been made Additionally the provision has been modified to provide that a MAC will occur with respect to Enron only if both rating agencies downgrade Enron Corp Please confirm this is OK On the guaranty you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp Legal My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher in this case maybe an extra than the threshold in the CSA that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded I will separately forward the guaranty to Clement Abrams for his approval The cap has been increased to US Tana is preparing a redline for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but dont expect many I apologize that the redline was not fully made against the US form I hope this is helpful Mark This has been very helpful Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things All excellent ideas Were looking forward to having you back Looking forward to seeing you soon Thanks again

tax provisions of the documentation As there is the possibility though unlikely that a nonJapanese counterparty will be permitted to trade Japanese weather such possibility has been addressed in the tax provisions Attached are the modified versions I also spoke with John Suttle today and he informed me that he was content with the provisions relating to credit Do you believe any further changes would be required in the GTCs if the transactions are entered into with a nonJapanese counterparty If not please proceed with the loading process Also I look forward to your response to my questions related to utilizing ENA as a counterparty for Japanese weather As mentioned if ENA and Japanese counterparties who may only have assets in Japan were to enter into these types of transactions the relevant GTCs should contain certain provisions to deal with Japanese legal issues Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on PM John Viverito AM To Brent nron cc Dale CT David

Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL The suggested change below takes care of the issue of not being able to modify the threshold level to be counterparty specific However I question whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a threshold at least for Enron What is the danger of this provision being triggered by some nonmaterial disputed debt If having a bilateral zero threshold works from an Enron credit perspective then I think you could go forward with using this provision I am open to everyones comments on this point Let me know if you have any other questions Regards Brent John Viverito PM To Brent nron cc Dale CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Jonathan nron Mark CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative

any of its assets other than its rights under the ISDA Agreement in relation to a debt or debts in an aggregate amount of not less than JPY or the equivalent in any currency and such attachment or

able to handle counterparty specific threshold levels in the GTCs and I dont think a generic threshold level will work for everyone Is there a way to redraft this provision or leave it out and still accomplish what you need to After the form is finalized then you will need to talk to Dale Neuner at about loading the documents and removing the product from Enron Australia Let me know if you have

from the draft you have provided Please inform me with regard to paragraph a ix as to what if anything should be inserted for the event of default threshold amount I have also copied Susan Musch on this email so that she can determine if all is well from the tax perspective Once Susan signsoff from the tax perspective please inform me as to what needs to be done to load the GTCs noting that the existing EOL GTCs for Japanese weather are utilizing Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited as the counterparty My understanding is that those GTCs will then be removed I have also copied David Minns in Australia so that he is aware of the status of this matter Cheers John Brent Hendry AM To John nron cc Mark CT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL John I am attaching the GTC with a few changes marked in the draft Is this GTC only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp and a Japanese counterparty The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties With respect to footnote number you are correct the issue is covered under f Noted With respect to footnote number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents of Japan on derivative transactions Please let me know if this is not the case I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence to

<12835252.1075859957741.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.viverito@enron.com,2000-09-18 21:40:00,Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Cc Today we received IBJs responsive comments to the points that have been raised which are set forth below for your review IBJ has stated In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA During our recent meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this correspondence Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM John Viverito AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like

<6227440.1075860226696.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.viverito@enron.com,2000-07-19 20:13:00,Re Meeting with Kim Chang EOL Korean legal survey Cc I am unsure as to what Mike Dahlke is referencing when utilizing the term Business Model Patent If you believe it appropriate perhaps you could clarify this with him I note that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a conference call that was in progress The question that Jae Moo had raised was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be categorized as a commodity derivative as opposed to a financial derivative I informed the participants on the call that in Japan weather derivatives are considered financial in nature most analagous under the Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions The basis for this is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather derivative as would be possible in a commodity type transaction therefore resulting in the classification of a financial derivative If I may be of further assistance please contact me My office phone number in Tokyo is Cheers John Matthias CT AM To Alan CT Mark CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Edmund CT John nron cc Angeline CT Subject Meeting with Kim Chang EOL Korean legal survey Alan MarkDavid John Edmund I had a telephone conference with Kim ChangEnron Korea this afternoon The meeting was initiated by Mike Dahlke APACHI Regulatory Affairs and Jae Moo Lee Enron Korea Attendence Mike Dahlke Enron Jae Moo Lee Enron Michelle Lee Enron Matt Lee Enron by telephone SK Hong Kim Chang Summary of issues discussed Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or received Financial Derivatives are not defined Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for each trade Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of Korea for each trade Failure to make report or obtain approval means the Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment Bank of Korea has informally advised KC that for Commodity Derivatives the report can be made by the foreign counterparty ie Enron and notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report can be done as soon as possible after the trade confirmation However Bank of Korea has the discretion to reject any report made This would make a trade effectively unperformable or unenforceable Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April and informally informed KC that they have yet to receive a single report Prior to April reports were made to certain designated banks KC advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty it would have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is hedging but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign copunterparty makes the report I am of the opinion that this statement should be viewed with caution especially since there is really no expereince in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea For Financial Derivatives prior approval is required before a trade is done and may take to days The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean entities In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified KC recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation The Ministry of Finance and Economy which is the legislative authority may have to be approached if Bank of Korea is unableunwilling to make a decision Such lobbying is likely to be protracted I have asked KC to make informal enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives and whether it would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives KC also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather Derivatives KC was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company out to make lots of money Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan which he had spoken with John V about John could you fill me in in case applicable to Korea It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting toapproval from Bank of Korea The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives potentially offered out of Enron Japan The Korean regulations do not seem to accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading let alone instantaneous online derivative trading Please advise next steps in particular do the commercial guys want to proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated Meanwhile I attach my comments and queries of KCs memorandum for your review Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for me to revert to KC Regards Matt

they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the

ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like

utilizing the term Business Model Patent If you believe it appropriate perhaps you could clarify this with him I note that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a conference call that was in progress The question that Jae Moo had raised was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be categorized as a commodity derivative as opposed to a financial derivative I informed the participants on the call that in Japan weather derivatives are considered financial in nature most analagous under the Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions The basis for this is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather derivative as would be possible in a commodity type transaction therefore resulting in the classification of a financial derivative If I may be of further assistance please contact me My office phone number in Tokyo is Cheers John Matthias CT AM To Alan CT Mark CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Edmund CT John nron cc Angeline CT Subject Meeting with Kim Chang EOL Korean legal survey Alan MarkDavid John Edmund I had a telephone conference with Kim ChangEnron Korea this afternoon The meeting was initiated by Mike Dahlke APACHI Regulatory Affairs and Jae Moo Lee Enron Korea Attendence Mike Dahlke Enron Jae Moo Lee Enron Michelle Lee Enron Matt Lee Enron by telephone SK Hong Kim Chang Summary of issues discussed Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or received Financial Derivatives are not defined Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for each trade Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of Korea for each trade Failure to make report or obtain approval means the Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment Bank of Korea has informally advised KC that for Commodity Derivatives the report can be made by the foreign counterparty ie Enron and notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report can be done as soon as possible after the trade confirmation However Bank of Korea has the discretion to reject any report made This would make a trade effectively unperformable or unenforceable Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April and informally informed KC that they have yet to receive a single report Prior to April reports were made to certain designated banks KC advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty it would have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is hedging but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign copunterparty makes the report I am of the opinion that this statement should be viewed with caution especially since there is really no expereince in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea For Financial Derivatives prior approval is required before a trade is done and may take to days The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean entities In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified KC recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation The Ministry of Finance and Economy which is the legislative authority may have to be approached if Bank of Korea is unableunwilling to make a decision Such lobbying is likely to be protracted I have asked KC to make informal enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives and whether it would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives KC also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather Derivatives KC was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company out to make lots of money Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan which he had spoken with John V about John could you fill me in in case applicable to Korea It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting toapproval from Bank of Korea The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives potentially offered out of Enron Japan The Korean regulations do not seem to accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading let alone instantaneous online derivative trading Please advise next steps in particular do the commercial guys want to proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated Meanwhile I attach my comments and queries of KCs memorandum for your review Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for me to revert to KC Regards Matt

your commentsquestions and my responsive comments which are set forth below in red Look forward to seeing you soon Hi Susan Please review the attached documents from the tax perspective Thanks Best regards John Mark CT PM To John nron cc Subject Japanese ISDA Documents Dear John So sorry for the delay I hope it hasnt caused too much inconvenience No problem I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I dont have your phone number Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent Part b In our other derivatives trading the cross default test applies to Enron Corp with a Threshold of US To accomplish this in the schedule Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly The Schedule has been revised Please advise if the equivalent change should be made to paragraph bivB of paragraph of the CSA Part d Has Baker McKenzie recommended this We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation ie the outstanding transactions terminate automatically leaving us with an open unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it In the US the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge According to BM the ability to setoff against Japanese counterparties is limited by certain laws relating to insolvency including the Bankruptcy Law These laws give a trustee the right to cherry pick contracts Accordingly it is the general practice in Japan for parties to elect automatic early termination to ensure that close out netting takes place before the trustees right to cherry pick comes into effect In December a netting law came into effect in Japan which specifically permits close out netting notwithstanding the trustees right to cherry pick The netting law only applies where one of the parties to the transaction is a financial institution Mitsui Marine and Fire Sanwa and IBJ would all qualify From a legal perspective it is now arguable that automatic early termination should not be adopted for the same reasons as are described in you message However as a matter of Japanese market practice BM has advised that most schedules with Japanese counterparties still specify automatic early termination Accordingly the automatic early termination provision in place Please confirm that this is acceptable Please also note that the automatic early termination provision will be necessary when Enron Japan deals with Japanese corporations that are not financial institutions Part e We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the nondefaulting party the most flexibility Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature However in many of the markets where we operate quotations will not be available where they are available they may well not be meaningful and the Loss method gives flexibility while still requiring commercial reasonableness The Schedule has been revised Part hix This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex When we have the ability to ask for or be asked for collateral in the case of a downgrading we build that event into the Paragraph to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position If the party fails it then becomes a default allowing termination The Schedule has been revised Part hx Wouldnt the cross default be triggered before this could happen BM has advised that although the cross default provisions may well be triggered before this clause applies the clause is standard in Japan and is not detrimental to Enron therefore the clause has been left in place Part Have our internal Tax people approved this I have copied Susan Musch on this email so that she may review the documents for tax purposes Part I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to Since Enron Corp will be a Credit Support Provider does it have a Representative Director etc The clause has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection with the Enron Corp guarantee Please fill in the blanks to specify the appropriate documents Sorry for the oversight The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary In many nonUS jurisdictions local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval in others derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents etc BM has stated that in practice they have never been given or asked to review a Japanese law opinion in relation to a specific ISDA schedule entered into by a Japanese counterparty and would expect Japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions Part b gh These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind although they may be helpful for other reasons as well If neither party is in the US the CFTC reason may go away On the other hand since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well If that is our theory there are additional representations the Eligible Swap Participant reps that we should think about putting back in These representations were tailored with the Japanese prohibition on gambling in mind I was not able to find the eligible swap participant representation in the Enron US ISDA Form although there is a reference to this in the opinion Please inform me as to the wording that needs to be added for New York purposes Part d We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA definitions While I think we will get there we havent actually made the decision yet So far I guess we leave it the way it is OK Part j My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about For the swap counterparties currently being considered by Enron Mitsui Marine IBJ and Sanwa no guarantees are being required BM has advised the form of the Enron Corp guarantee would generally be acceptable for guaranteeing the obligations of Japanese counterparties However there are a number of changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and jurisdiction provisions to Japan for ease of enforcement against parties whose principal assets are located in Japan It is recommended that the guarantee be reviewed in further detail before it is actually proposed to counterparties Paragraph I have to admit Im not as familiar with the Paragraph provisions as the Schedule My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like theres a glitch in the form It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the major agencies we shouldnt be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us The way it is drafted now if either SP or Moodys stops rating us even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur The counterparty doesnt have to worry about Moodys at all Just a thought The suggested change has been made Additionally the provision has been modified to provide that a MAC will occur with respect to Enron only if both rating agencies downgrade Enron Corp Please confirm this is OK On the guaranty you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp Legal My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher in this case maybe an extra than the threshold in the CSA that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded I will separately forward the guaranty to Clement Abrams for his approval The cap has been increased to US Tana is preparing a redline for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but dont expect many I apologize that the redline was not fully made against the US form I hope this is helpful Mark This has been very helpful Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things All excellent ideas Were looking forward to having you back Looking forward to seeing you soon Thanks again

Japan for parties to elect automatic early termination to ensure that close out netting takes place before the trustees right to cherry pick comes into effect In December a netting law came into effect in Japan which specifically permits close out netting notwithstanding the trustees right to cherry pick The netting law only applies where one of the parties to the transaction is a financial institution Mitsui Marine and Fire Sanwa and IBJ would all qualify From a legal perspective it is now arguable that automatic early termination should not be adopted for the same reasons as are described in you message However as a matter of Japanese market practice BM has advised that most schedules with Japanese counterparties still specify automatic early termination Accordingly the automatic early termination provision in place Please confirm that this is acceptable Please also note that the automatic early termination provision will be necessary when Enron Japan deals with Japanese corporations that are not financial institutions Part e We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the nondefaulting party the most flexibility Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature However in many of the markets where we operate quotations will not be available where they are available they may well not be meaningful and the Loss method gives flexibility while still requiring commercial reasonableness The Schedule has been revised Part hix This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex When we have the ability to ask for or be asked for collateral in the case of a downgrading we build that event into the Paragraph to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position If the party fails it then becomes a default allowing termination The Schedule has been revised Part hx Wouldnt the cross default be triggered before this could happen BM has advised that although the cross default provisions may well be triggered before this clause applies the clause is standard in Japan and is not detrimental to Enron therefore the clause has been left in place Part Have our internal Tax people approved this I have copied Susan Musch on this email so that she may review the documents for tax purposes Part I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to Since Enron Corp will be a Credit Support Provider does it have a Representative Director etc The clause has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection with the Enron Corp guarantee Please fill in the blanks to specify the appropriate documents Sorry for the oversight The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary In many nonUS jurisdictions local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval in others derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents etc BM has stated that in practice they have never been given or asked to review a Japanese law opinion in relation to a specific ISDA schedule entered into by a Japanese counterparty and would expect Japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions Part b gh These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind although they may be helpful for other reasons as well If neither party is in the US the CFTC reason may go away On the other hand since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well If that is our theory there are additional representations the Eligible Swap Participant reps that we should think about putting back in These representations were tailored with the Japanese prohibition on gambling in mind I was not able to find the eligible swap participant representation in the Enron US ISDA Form although there is a reference to this in the opinion Please inform me as to the wording that needs to be added for New York purposes Part d We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA definitions While I think we will get there we havent actually made the decision yet So far I guess we leave it the way it is OK Part j My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about For the swap counterparties currently being considered by Enron Mitsui Marine IBJ and Sanwa no guarantees are being required BM has advised the form of the Enron Corp guarantee would generally be acceptable for guaranteeing the obligations of Japanese counterparties However there are a number of changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and jurisdiction provisions to Japan for ease of enforcement against parties whose principal assets are located in Japan It is recommended that the guarantee be reviewed in further detail before it is actually proposed to counterparties Paragraph I have to admit Im not as familiar with the Paragraph provisions as the Schedule My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like theres a glitch in the form It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the major agencies we shouldnt be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us The way it is drafted now if either SP or Moodys stops rating us even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur The counterparty doesnt have to worry about Moodys at all Just a thought The suggested change has been made Additionally the provision has been modified to provide that a MAC will occur with respect to Enron only if both rating agencies downgrade Enron Corp Please confirm this is OK On the guaranty you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp Legal My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher in this case maybe an extra than the threshold in the CSA that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded I will separately forward the guaranty to Clement Abrams for his approval The cap has been increased to US Tana is preparing a redline for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but dont expect many I apologize that the redline was not fully made against the US form I hope this is helpful Mark This has been very helpful Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things All excellent ideas Were looking forward to having you back Looking forward to seeing you soon Thanks again

would be required in the GTCs if the transactions are entered into with a nonJapanese counterparty If not please proceed with the loading process Also I look forward to your response to my questions related to utilizing ENA as a counterparty for Japanese weather As mentioned if ENA and Japanese counterparties who may only have assets in Japan were to enter into these types of transactions the

Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL The suggested change below takes care of the issue of not being able to modify the threshold level to be counterparty specific However I question whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a threshold at least for Enron What is the danger of this provision being triggered by some nonmaterial disputed debt If having a bilateral zero threshold works from an Enron credit perspective then I think you could go forward with using this provision I am open to everyones comments on this point Let me know if you have any other questions Regards Brent John Viverito PM To Brent nron cc Dale CT David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Jonathan nron Mark CT Susan MuschENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative

any of its assets other than its rights under the ISDA Agreement in relation to a debt or debts in an aggregate amount of not less than JPY or the equivalent in any currency and such attachment or

able to handle counterparty specific threshold levels in the GTCs and I dont think a generic threshold level will work for everyone Is there a way to redraft this provision or leave it out and still accomplish what you need to After the form is finalized then you will need to talk to Dale Neuner at about loading the documents and removing the product from Enron Australia Let me know if you have

this email so that she can determine if all is well from the tax perspective Once Susan signsoff from the tax perspective please inform me as to what needs to be done to load the GTCs noting that the existing EOL GTCs for Japanese weather are utilizing Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited as the counterparty My understanding is that those GTCs will then be removed I have also copied David Minns in Australia so that he is aware of the status of this matter Cheers John Brent Hendry AM To John nron cc Mark CT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL John I am attaching the GTC with a few changes marked in the draft Is this GTC only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp and a Japanese counterparty The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties With respect to footnote number you are correct the issue is covered under f Noted With respect to footnote number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents of Japan on derivative transactions Please let me know if this is not the case I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence to

<16556981.1075860024027.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,john.viverito@enron.com,2000-09-18 21:40:00,Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Cc Today we received IBJs responsive comments to the points that have been raised which are set forth below for your review IBJ has stated In terms of CSA as we are not ready for running collateral operations we still do not prefer to use the CSA During our recent meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial institutions I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan from IBJ of roughly US Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his input IBJs specific responses are quoted below as follows Part a Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA g We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as for a party a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor e Part We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only Part fEven though deleting the word not in this provision we can net the payments with respect to the same Transaction Due to our system incapability we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo re Transactions in the same currency h Agreed Part a If your suggested language is included a Nondefaulting Party has to continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation which does not seem realistic We prefer to terminate Transactions when an Event of Default occurs We do not like to include the provision which releases a technical error c Agreed e We propose business days instead g We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a partys branch offices If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan we will amend this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office We hea rd that in most jurisdictions of the world it is not effective to setoff th e obligations between a party and the other partys Affiliate i Agreed to include this provision j We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation s without the other partys consent to even its Affiliates We might not get approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might cause an additional payment of tax or other cost k We will revert to you later m Agreed n Agreed to include this provision Part We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity Transactions in the respective Confirmations I look forward to receiving your input I note that Jane McBride has start ed here at Enron Japan therefore I have copied her on this correspondence Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon Best regards John Forwarded by John ViveritoCorpEnron on AM John Viverito AM To Mark CT cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT Mark Thanks for your input I agree with all of the comments you have raised As to Part n the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit h regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for transactions under the ISDA documentation I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic e relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex Therefore I have asked Baker McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an d will provide this information upon receipt Following receipt of John Suttles comments I will prepare the response to IBJ based on the points that have been raised by both you and John Thanks John Mark CT PM To John NRON cc Kevin CT Steve n CT Tom Bruce CT Subject Re Fw IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle Credit and it looks like hes going to insist on the CSA We are going to talk tomorrow and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments While we have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a master agreement the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy Many of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents It would be helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a markup Following are my points responsive to their revisions Part a The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes for example this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy this agreement would be in default g This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk to the other party It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a reason to remove it Part The language inserted is much to vague Our original version spells out exactly what is expected of the parties If the documents we listed ar e not acceptable IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we agree we will put it in the agreement Part f By deleting the word not in this provision IBJ is saying tha t payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne t ie if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating we each have to make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o ne payment This is not acceptable h If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent we should use Enron Corp or E NA Part a Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to receive payments due even though technically in default under another provision of the agreement Our position is that if there are no other possible payment requirements due from the purchaser the option should be honored c The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same city For many markets in which we participate it is very difficult if n ot impossible to find multiple market makers in the same city e The change to business days is much too long This means we can no t have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks We can go as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market practice g Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t o multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows setoff with each IBJ branch as a separate entity This may not be an issue if we will never trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we will never do business with any other branch of IBJ We usually dont like to restrict ourselves that way i We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions If there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu t wholesale deletion is out of the question j As with Part g this section adds flexibility to both parties while maintaining flexibility within the corporate family Given the frequency with which Enron moves businesses around within the family this section is important to us k This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha t went into bankruptcy and therefore default while they were in the money We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement without o ur revision we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds a rathe r high rate given their status as a bankrupt We feel the nondefault rate i s more appropriate m I cant imagine why they wouldnt want this section included it protects us both n You know more about this than I Part These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them individually if they object for some articulated reason If these provisio ns are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation a significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it and we need to know now if they object to any of them Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects I hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long Im happy to discus s any of these issues at greater length if you want It sounds to me like
