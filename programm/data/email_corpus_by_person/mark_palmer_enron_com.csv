the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III PARTIES Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego California Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDGE and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class Period defined infra that are unjust and unfair and that have been artificially inflated by defendants misconduct Moreover plaintiff Pamela R Gordon was born with no lymph

names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff When their true names and capacities are ascertained Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff as herein alleged Further Plaintiff is informed and believes and upon such information and belief alleges that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each

Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of

COMMUNICATIONS on PM PDT To Joe HirkoEnron nron Communications Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Ken RiceEnron nron Communications Kelly KimberlyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark NRON Karen NRON Paula NRON cc Subject Enron is both old and new economy an article Enron is both Old and New Economy Saw opportunity that Canadian firms missed Mathew Ingram says MATHEW INGRAM The Globe and Mail Calgary Old Economy New Economy In the past few weeks one goes down while the other goes up and then the next day they change places For the nervous there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them That company is Houstonbased Enron Corp and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but arent Enron is one of the worlds largest energy companies with a market value of about billion US and interests in electric power generation natural gas production pipelines and related industries But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business the fibreoptic information pipeline business Not only does it own a massive fibre network but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading Not that long ago Enron was a sleepy old energy utility much like TransCanada PipeLines for example Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibreoptic bandwidth Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years he expects the bandwidth market will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets or about billion It didnt take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks that is readymade routes Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a billion company called Qwest Communications which is merging with US West Williams Cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in for billion The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications In Canada Albertabased construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail and sold access to phone and Internet companies That business became Networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge formerly IPL and Westcoast while all this was going on Well Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses Enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the range last fall to about Given its exposure to technology Enron has suffered a little bit lately Enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and Networks are building or buying them Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PGE who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway Six other US energy companies have a similar joint venture With all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas Enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management Whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline Not much Can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time That remains to be seen but Enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become the General Electric of the New Economy

COMMUNICATIONS on PM PDT To Joe HirkoEnron nron Communications Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Ken RiceEnron nron Communications Kelly KimberlyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark NRON Karen NRON Paula NRON cc Subject Enron is both old and new economy an article Enron is both Old and New Economy Saw opportunity that Canadian firms missed Mathew Ingram says MATHEW INGRAM The Globe and Mail Calgary Old Economy New Economy In the past few weeks one goes down while the other goes up and then the next day they change places For the nervous there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them That company is Houstonbased Enron Corp and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but arent Enron is one of the worlds largest energy companies with a market value of about billion US and interests in electric power generation natural gas production pipelines and related industries But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business the fibreoptic information pipeline business Not only does it own a massive fibre network but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading Not that long ago Enron was a sleepy old energy utility much like TransCanada PipeLines for example Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibreoptic bandwidth Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years he expects the bandwidth market will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets or about billion It didnt take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks that is readymade routes Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a billion company called Qwest Communications which is merging with US West Williams Cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in for billion The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications In Canada Albertabased construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail and sold access to phone and Internet companies That business became Networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge formerly IPL and Westcoast while all this was going on Well Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses Enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the range last fall to about Given its exposure to technology Enron has suffered a little bit lately Enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and Networks are building or buying them Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PGE who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway Six other US energy companies have a similar joint venture With all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas Enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management Whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline Not much Can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time That remains to be seen but Enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become the General Electric of the New Economy

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III

a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each

have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants violations of the Antitrust Act The Cartwright Act states Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter may sue therefore and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her interest and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase

injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable andor injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act Civil Code Section et seq Defendants acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code c That damages be granted according to proof and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages where applicable attorneys fees costs and disbursements d That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre and postjudgment interest e That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief including the disgorgement of defendants unlawful profits and f That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances Dated November KRAUSE KALFAYAN James C Krause Esq Ralph B Kalfayan

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III

names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff When their true names and capacities are ascertained Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff as herein alleged Further Plaintiff is informed and believes and upon such information and belief alleges that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Cartwright Act states at o that Except as provided in this chapter every trust is unlawful against public policy and void A trust is defined at o as follows A

or commodity Agree to pool combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in any manner be affected Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants violations of the Antitrust Act The Cartwright Act states Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter may sue therefore and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her interest and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition alleged herein violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract conspiracy combination and trust and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable andor injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act Civil Code Section et seq Defendants acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code c That damages be granted according to proof and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages where applicable attorneys fees costs and disbursements d That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre and postjudgment interest e That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief including the disgorgement of defendants unlawful profits

COMMUNICATIONS on PM PDT To Joe HirkoEnron nron Communications Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Ken RiceEnron nron Communications Kelly KimberlyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark NRON Karen NRON Paula NRON cc Subject Enron is both old and new economy an article Enron is both Old and New Economy Saw opportunity that Canadian firms missed Mathew Ingram says MATHEW INGRAM The Globe and Mail Calgary Old Economy New Economy In the past few weeks one goes down while the other goes up and then the next day they change places For the nervous there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them That company is Houstonbased Enron Corp and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but arent Enron is one of the worlds largest energy companies with a market value of about billion US and interests in electric power generation natural gas production pipelines and related industries But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business the fibreoptic information pipeline business Not only does it own a massive fibre network but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading Not that long ago Enron was a sleepy old energy utility much like TransCanada PipeLines for example Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibreoptic bandwidth Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years he expects the bandwidth market will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets or about billion It didnt take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks that is readymade routes Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a billion company called Qwest Communications which is merging with US West Williams Cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in for billion The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications In Canada Albertabased construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail and sold access to phone and Internet companies That business became Networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge formerly IPL and Westcoast while all this was going on Well Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses Enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the range last fall to about Given its exposure to technology Enron has suffered a little bit lately Enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and Networks are building or buying them Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PGE who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway Six other US energy companies have a similar joint venture With all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas Enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management Whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline Not much Can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time That remains to be seen but Enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become the General Electric of the New Economy

COMMUNICATIONS on PM PDT To Joe HirkoEnron nron Communications Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Ken RiceEnron nron Communications Kelly KimberlyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark NRON Karen NRON Paula NRON cc Subject Enron is both old and new economy an article Enron is both Old and New Economy Saw opportunity that Canadian firms missed Mathew Ingram says MATHEW INGRAM The Globe and Mail Calgary Old Economy New Economy In the past few weeks one goes down while the other goes up and then the next day they change places For the nervous there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them That company is Houstonbased Enron Corp and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but arent Enron is one of the worlds largest energy companies with a market value of about billion US and interests in electric power generation natural gas production pipelines and related industries But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business the fibreoptic information pipeline business Not only does it own a massive fibre network but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading Not that long ago Enron was a sleepy old energy utility much like TransCanada PipeLines for example Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibreoptic bandwidth Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years he expects the bandwidth market will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets or about billion It didnt take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks that is readymade routes Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a billion company called Qwest Communications which is merging with US West Williams Cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in for billion The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications In Canada Albertabased construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail and sold access to phone and Internet companies That business became Networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge formerly IPL and Westcoast while all this was going on Well Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses Enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the range last fall to about Given its exposure to technology Enron has suffered a little bit lately Enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and Networks are building or buying them Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PGE who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway Six other US energy companies have a similar joint venture With all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas Enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management Whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline Not much Can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time That remains to be seen but Enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become the General Electric of the New Economy

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III

business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each

or commodity Agree to pool combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in any manner be affected Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants violations of the Antitrust Act The Cartwright Act states Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter may sue therefore and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her interest and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition alleged herein violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract conspiracy combination and trust and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable andor injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code c That damages be granted according to proof and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages where applicable attorneys fees costs and disbursements d That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre and postjudgment interest e That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief including the disgorgement of defendants unlawful profits

COMMUNICATIONS on PM PDT To Joe HirkoEnron nron Communications Kevin HannonEnron nron Communications Ken RiceEnron nron Communications Kelly KimberlyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Mark NRON Karen NRON Paula NRON cc Subject Enron is both old and new economy an article Enron is both Old and New Economy Saw opportunity that Canadian firms missed Mathew Ingram says MATHEW INGRAM The Globe and Mail Calgary Old Economy New Economy In the past few weeks one goes down while the other goes up and then the next day they change places For the nervous there are a few companies that have a foot in both of these camps including one whose feet come with size large construction boots on them That company is Houstonbased Enron Corp and it is everything that Canadian energy and pipeline companies could have been but arent Enron is one of the worlds largest energy companies with a market value of about billion US and interests in electric power generation natural gas production pipelines and related industries But it is also a major player in a new kind of pipeline business the fibreoptic information pipeline business Not only does it own a massive fibre network but it is also a leader in the emerging market of bandwidth trading Not that long ago Enron was a sleepy old energy utility much like TransCanada PipeLines for example Then the company realized it could play a role in the market for new commodities such as fibreoptic bandwidth Enron president Jeff Skilling said recently that in five or six years he expects the bandwidth market will be as large as the combined natural gas and electricity markets or about billion It didnt take a genius to see that pipeline companies had an advantage when it came to building fibre networks that is readymade routes Railway and oil industry magnate Philip Anschutz was one of the early entrants in the market having hit on the idea of laying fibreoptic cables along his railway rightsofway an idea that became a billion company called Qwest Communications which is merging with US West Williams Cos had the same idea of laying fibre alongside its pipelines and later sold that business to MCI WorldCom in for billion The company is now completing a new network through subsidiary Williams Communications In Canada Albertabased construction company Ledcor started laying fibre as it was repairing tracks for CN Rail and sold access to phone and Internet companies That business became Networks a separate unit that is expected to go public this week So where were pipeline and energy companies like TransCanada and Nova and Enbridge formerly IPL and Westcoast while all this was going on Well Nova was busy trying to be a chemical and a pipeline company and then it and TransCanada were busy fighting the Alliance pipeline project and then they decided to merge in one of the worlds alltime worst merger deals Now TransCanada has its hands full trying to replace the billions in market value it has managed to lose over the past year Westcoast and Enbridge have focused on pipelines and related interests and they have both done a good job of it but they remain tied to fundamentally lowmargin businesses Enron has swung for the fences and thats why its stock has climbed from the range last fall to about Given its exposure to technology Enron has suffered a little bit lately Enron isnt the only one building the pipes for the information industry mind you Established companies such as Qwest and WorldCom own extensive networks while newer entrants such as Global Crossing and Networks are building or buying them Enron even has competition from energy firms such as BP Amoco and PGE who recently bought a stake in a company called Aerie Networks that is building a network using their pipeline rightsofway Six other US energy companies have a similar joint venture With all this building some industry watchers have raised the spectre of a bandwidth glut and it is conceivable there will be some kind of consolidation But Enron is in a good position to be one of the consolidators and meanwhile the company is taking advantage of the increase in demand for fibre capacity by setting up a bandwidth trading market This is another area where energy companies like Enron have an advantage They are already accustomed to sophisticated trading and hedging of commodities such as pipeline capacity and natural gas Enron for example is a leader in energy trading and risk management Whats so different about selling space on a fibreoptic pipeline Not much Can a single company explore produce and ship natural gas produce and sell electric power and become a leader in Internet infrastructure all at the same time That remains to be seen but Enron appears determined to try and thats why brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch say it has a chance to become the General Electric of the New Economy

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III PARTIES Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego California Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDGE and has been forced to pay rates for

names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff When their true names and capacities are ascertained Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff as herein alleged Further Plaintiff is informed and believes and upon such information and belief alleges that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each

Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open

Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the

injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III PARTIES Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego California Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDGE and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class Period defined infra that are unjust and unfair and that have been artificially inflated by defendants misconduct Moreover plaintiff Pamela R Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack of circulation Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela R Gordons legs to swell which can lead to possible severe health consequences As a result of her condition plaintiff Pamela R Gordon must maintain her home at temperatures of not more than degrees at night and degrees during the day Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is unable to terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and unfair rates for electricity from SDGE as a result of defendants misconduct Specifically plaintiff Pamela R Gordon was charged andor paid the following rates for electricity by SDGE during the Class Period Dates Total Electric Charges to to to to to Plaintiff was charged less for electricity per kWh prior to the Class Period and the inception of Defendants wrongful conduct Dates Total Electric Charges to Defendant Reliant Energy hereinafter Reliant is a Houston Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Reliant Energy Services It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers including plaintiff and the class and is a WSCC member

names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff When their true names and capacities are ascertained Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff as herein alleged Further Plaintiff is informed and believes and upon such information and belief alleges that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Cartwright Act states at o that Except as provided in this chapter every trust is unlawful against public policy and void A trust is defined at o as follows A

or commodity Agree to pool combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in any manner be affected Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants violations of the Antitrust Act The Cartwright Act states Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter may sue therefore and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her interest and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition alleged herein violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract conspiracy combination and trust and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable andor injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act Civil Code Section et seq Defendants acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code c That damages be granted according to proof and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages where applicable attorneys fees costs and disbursements d That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre and postjudgment interest e That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief including the disgorgement of defendants unlawful profits

<5515891.1075852652510.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.palmer@enron.com,2001-07-10 10:36:24,Great editorialHeres an editorial that gets to the heart of the matter Tuesday July Ghost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol Gray Davis is following footsteps of former OC treasurer into fiscal cha os JOHN MW MOORLACH Mr Moorlach is the Orange County treasurertax collector A recent LA Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy Perhaps the s tates subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five mont hs has caused us to believe that everything is fine It is not The state has been spending an average of million a mediumsized citys annual b udget per day for electricity Now California is headed toward the same fi nancial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholderowned utilities fi nding one of them in Chapter bankruptcy and another on the precipice At this pace it will not be long before the state will be staring a Chapter bankruptcy filing in the face Thats why Im gnawed by this dj vu s ensation The similarities and parallels between California of and Ora nge County of are frightening Heres a refresher In the county through former Treasurer Robert Citron was borrowing at variable rates an d investing at fixed rates The experts and the politicos were comforta ble with the investment scheme No wonder the electorate was convinced tha t there were no investing improprieties Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was investing and what his exit strategy would be Guess what The unexpected happened Shortterm borrowing rates d oubled The cost of borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generate d It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers re alized a billion loss In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this tr ain wreck the countys leadership he ignored it The rest is history In a halfpregnant deregulation scheme the state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge It also eliminated the availability to acquire el ectricity through the use of longterm contracts Guess what The unexpect ed happened The wholesale price for electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap It depleted the available funds for the ut ilities and then some and they are imploding In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov Gray Davis to avoid or minimize this train wreck he ignored them The rest is also history It gets worse Davis doesnt al low for the immediate raising of retail rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity Guess what The expected happened He deple ted our budget surplus Our reserves Nearly billion and counting He s a Citron only quintupled And in the light of day the secret purchases were not attractively priced and only compound this financial nightmare G ov Davis has done what no Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of do ing in such a short time He has returned the budget surplus created by tax payers to the residents of California by subsidizing their electricity bill s Bravo It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes but has anyone ever thought up a more efficient method But thats not all He wa nts it back Davis now wants to borrow some billion to replace the spen t reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the ret ail prices When does this train wreck in slow motion stop And how do we pay off these bonds Davis did not want to raise rates last summer or this past winter But now he will to pay off this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase The ratepayers wil l be reminded for years after Davis is gone about his expensive brillian ce And this elected official wants to purchase the power grids and bureauc ratically manage the utilities I say no If we dont show some leadersh ip in Sacramento soon potential bond buyers will also say no unless the y receive an attractive interest rate Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates It just subscribed million in bonds paying percent Tragically Gov Davis walked into his position with an existin g budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to show for it No reserves No improved highways No new schools No infrastructure improvements Onl y interest payments Wasnt that Citrons legacy If amortized over yea rs at percent the citizens of California will pay an additional bil lion in interest costs Over years its billion And therein lies t he true legacy of Davis squandering the entire budget surplus that he inhe rited on interest resulting from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in de nial and continues to play the blame game Orange County played the blam e game too But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of l aw in securing a significant amount in retribution payments Im not so sur e California will have a similar result

defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III

a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents data and information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as confidential or commercially sensitive under Section provided however that the ISO need not keep confidential information that is explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section of this ISO Tariff information that the ISO or the Market Participant providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO Tariff or applicable regulatory requirements provided that the ISO shall comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure or information that becomes available to the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of the ISOs breach of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators shall be treated by the ISO as confidential a individual bids for Supplemental Energy b individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not designated by the scheduling coordinator as available c individual bids for Ancillary Services d transactions between Scheduling Coordinators e individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short term ie one month or less in which case the ISO may publish the name of that Generator CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO or to review any documents data or other information of another Market Participant to the extent such documents data or information is to be treated as in accordance with Section provided however a market Participant may receive and review any composite documents data and other information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents data or information if the composite document does not disclose such confidential data or information relating to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Cartwright Act states at o that Except as provided in this chapter every trust is unlawful against public policy and void A trust is defined at o as follows A

have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of defendants violations of the Antitrust Act The Cartwright Act states Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter may sue therefore and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her interest and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid absent defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition alleged herein violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies obtained by defendants acts of unfair competition with respect to the contract conspiracy combination and trust and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the general public which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and deceptive acts and practices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court providing appropriate equitable andor injunctive relief restraining defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating the electricity markets FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act Civil Code Section et seq Defendants acts warrant appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief including an injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code c That damages be granted according to proof and that Plaintiff and the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages where applicable attorneys fees costs and disbursements d That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre and postjudgment interest e That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable relief including the disgorgement of defendants unlawful profits and f That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances Dated November KRAUSE KALFAYAN James C Krause Esq Ralph B Kalfayan

the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the investigation made by and through her attorneys as follows I NATURE OF THE CASE This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California for defendants conduct in the market for wholesale electricity During the spring and summer of a group of electricity generators and traders including defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated the California wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western United States Defendants accomplished this result by inter alia improperly using confidential real time generator capacity use and maintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesale electricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from the California Power Exchanges forward markets by improperly parking power with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at inflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide with other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by scheduling transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of the California Tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesale electricity within California By engaging in said unfair business practices defendants have directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange As noted in the August San Diego Union Tribune The utility bills of all electric ratepayers in San Diego are exorbitant Rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short of confiscatory rates In its November Order the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC expressly found that electricity prices in California have been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevant period though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto In its November response to the November st FERC order the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC concluded that due to market manipulation by wholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of In its November nd response to the November st FERC order even the California Independent System Operator CAISO which manages Californias transmission system infrastructure known as the power grid found that the summer prices resulted from the exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders II VENUE Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the State of California and because the damages caused by defendants unlawful manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego County III PARTIES Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego California Plaintiff Pamela R Gordon is a retail electricity customer of SDGE and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class Period defined infra that are unjust and unfair and that have been artificially inflated by defendants misconduct Moreover plaintiff Pamela R Gordon was born with no lymph

names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff When their true names and capacities are ascertained Plaintiff will amend this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein Plaintiff is informed and believe and based thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and thereby proximately caused injuries and damages to Plaintiff as herein alleged Further Plaintiff is informed and believes and upon such information and belief alleges that each of the Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in andor benefited from the wrongful acts conduct and omissions described in this complaint and that said acts conduct and omissions directly and proximately caused injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below IV CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers including the retail customers of San Diego Gas Electric Company SDGE who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange during the period from May through and including the date of trial hereinafter the Class Period All such persons and entities have paid andor have been charged prices for electricity that were unjust and unreasonable and that were artificially inflated due to defendants exercise of market power improper use of confidential information manipulations and unlawful actions Members of the Class are extremely numerous and their joinder would be impracticable Approximately million SDGE customers are within the class Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues including whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter gamed the market whether defendants charged unjust and unreasonable prices for electricity during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for electricity whether defendants exercised market power in the California electricity market during the Class Period whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be refunded and paid to members of the Class Plaintiffs interests are typical of and not antagonistic to the interests of the class Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this action A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy The size of the individual damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the defendants operations and alleged misconduct A class action is the only method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims Plaintiff does not anticipate any difficulty with the management of this action V COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT A The California Wholesale Electricity Markets In California deregulated its electricity industry and required the States privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their generating plants The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition into the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates for electrical power In fact however certain participants in this recently deregulated industry have in violation of their operating Tariff taken advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for electricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at the expense of California consumers As part of the deregulation several new entities were created to facilitate the workings of this new market Californias investor owned utilities Pacific Gas Electric PGE Southern California Edison SCE and San Diego Gas Electric SDGE theUtilities now purchase electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders including defendants through a market known as the California Power Exchange PX The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time markets Under the California deregulatory scheme the Utilities were until just recently required to purchase power through the PX and prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California Independent System Operator CAISO The CAISO is an independent nonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representatives from among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flow of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltage power lines that make up the bulk of Californias transmission system Approximately of Californias electricity is distributed through the CAISO managed power grid The CAISO monitors electrical loads ie demand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of power to meet that demand The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance Market the Real Time Market When the CAISO receives bids from suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must accept any bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour Under the single price auction system used by the CAISO all sellers of electricity in the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price which is the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willing to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices This mechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants to game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing price The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply and demand Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market which is used to balance supply and demand of electricity Sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity If called upon by the ISO to deliver energy sellers in the Replacement Reserve Market also receive the Real Time Market price Thus if generators know that capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve Market Access to real time generating information facilitates such gaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competing supply In times of high demand the CAISO has the authority to purchase energy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative price cap The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of California generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California markets They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and uncapped prices As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November Report the PX Compliance Report During periods of high OutofMarket purchases when prices are above the RealTime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to export energy out of California Surrounding control areas can effectively park that energy for resale to the CAISO OutofMarket calls and return it to the state Id at p Notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increase in exports from the California energy market despite the very high prices and short supplies that existed in the State Market power is defined by the CAISO as the ability to significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from competitive levels for a material period of time Generators and suppliers including defendants can exercise market power by physically or economically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity out of the California markets and by pricing and bidding their resources in ways that impede the efficiency of the market Notably the California energy market consists of a relatively small number of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the total generating capacity The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise of market power during periods of high demand even when there is not a true scarcity of available generating capacity In addition the relatively inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market power B Defendants Improper Acts Prior to May the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC an organization consisting of electric industry participants including defendants with real time industry data as to electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmission system flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual market participants Through the WSCC Internet web site wholesale electricity market participants including defendants herein were thereby given access to real time data as to their competitors actions although access to such data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff When requested by various governmental entities including the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC the WSCC refused access CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part Meter Data supplied by an ISO metered entity shall be made available by the ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement but shall not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by law FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO Tariff CAISOFERC Tariff section states in relevant part The ISO shall

to an individual Market Participant and provided however that the ISO may disclose information as provided for in its bylaws Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring Information Protocol MMIP The objective of this Protocol MMIP is to set forth the workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to identify abuses of market power The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all ISO Market Participants including Defendants MMIP Section states in relevant part Anomalous market behavior which is defined as behavior that departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or unexplained market outcomes Evidence of such behavior may be derived from a number of circumstances including MMIP withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in which it would normally be offered in a competitive market MMIP unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by Generators MMIP unusual trades or transactions MMIP pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions eg prices and bids that appear consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions and MMIP unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or exports to other markets or exchanges The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market eg the strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity and whether it indicates the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable practices MMIP Section states in relevant part Gaming or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs Protocols or Activity Rules or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion to the detriment of the efficiency of and of consumers in the ISO Markets Gaming may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity such as loop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that may otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency Market participants used their trade organization the WSCC to share access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact that its publication and use violated the ISOs operating procedures as set forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC and by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants were authorized to sell electricity to the PX Those tariffs and protocols required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market and not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitive behavior It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work Com Newswire on October that Electricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports from the states grid operator to their advantage in Californias wholesale electricity market according to an official with the Western Systems Coordinating Council At issue is realtime information the California Independent System Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council a governmental sic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western US about power plant activity in the state The realtime information allows market participants to access data via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on the grid Last month however the ISOs attorneys alerted the WSCC that the data is being used against them and to game the market according to Bill Commish director of dispatch with the WSCC Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular region and use that to gouge customers However the ISO which controls about of the states power grid and realtime market may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to keep such information confidential for days an ISO attorney told the WSCC Beginning Monday the ISO will no longer provide such information to the WSCC or other market participants Starting on or about May Defendants used such real time data to exercise market power by among other things reducing their output strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price and other market prices As a direct result of their improper access to and use of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply upwards on May and has remained at artificially inflated prices ever since FERC CPUC and CAISO Dept of Market Analysis have all now concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board As noted in the North County Times on October A case study of San Diego Countys two big power plants has concluded that they held back from full production of electricity in June even as prices skyrocketed and Californias power manager was scrambling for supplies to prevent blackouts To the studys author the low production in San Diego county is clear evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices McCulloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for June found that the Encina plant in Carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that it could have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost of production The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated percent of what would be expected under traditional economic theory Economists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generate electricity at the plants The wholesale price in June averaged per megawatt hour A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed mysterious cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that electricity traders have waited until prices rose on Californias market this summer before they would commit their power plants to production We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to Jim Detmers the ISOs operations chief In addition defendants used such real time information about their competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISOs need to balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given period In addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity with affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the California markets They then sold that electricity back into the California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market to purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot Market rather than the less than that should be sold in that market The Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the demand for energy C Results of Defendants Activities From late May through the present defendants activities have raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the rates that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the costs of generating that electricity Those prices have resulted in an approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDGE where retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass through of SDGEs costs for such power which it purchases from the defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange As the Market Surveillance Committee MSC of the CAISO concluded in its September Report the MSC Report during the months of May and June revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy market were and respectively above the revenues that would have been generated under competitive pricing conditions MSC Report at p The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a significant amount of market power in the California energy markets beginning as early as October and increasing dramatically during the Class Period Id at pp The average market clearing price in Californias wholesale markets during August of was MWh under moderate load conditions compared with MWh a year earlier While load demand conditions in California during August were slightly higher than in August they were similar to those during August when prices were much lower Peak demand in August was lower than in August of either of the prior two years negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand caused these price increases Indeed some California electricity producers were only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the night when electricity is abundant and demand is low Further prices in November when demand for electricity is much lower than during the summer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive marketplace As a result of defendants exercise of market power they artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge windfall profits As reported in the October San Diego Union Tribune analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity industry profits from California for the months ended September could reach billion even after taking into account cost increases Feygin stated The industry was literally at eight times the profitability of last year that is a fortune Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will top last years figure by about million Similarly defendant Dynegy reported an percent increase in its third quarter income as compared to its third quarter figures Profits from Defendant Dynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of Dynegys overall profits This is the most successful quarter in Dynegys history reported chairman and chief executive officer Charles Chuck Watson Other defendants also obtained large windfall profits during this period Prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatt hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately per MWh During the Summer of defendants conduct caused the Real Time Market price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per MWh resulting in an approximate tripling of SDGE customers bills In its Order issued on November FERC concluded that wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at unjust and unreasonable levels during the Summer of CAISO and CPUC responses to the November st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during Summer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators and traders Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customers of SDGE since costs were fully passed through to them The CPUCs November report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by wholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for the delivery of electricity to California during the summer of Due to the unlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses As Congressman Brian Bilbray stated Every day that goes by youve got small businesses bleeding to death People are literally dying financially from this situation Workcom Newswire The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived and artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect of artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to billions of dollars at the expense of plaintiffs and the class FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections and of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the Antitrust Act Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each

Plaintiffs and the Class are persons within the meaning of the Antitrust Act as defined in o Beginning on or about May the exact date being presently unknown to Plaintiffs Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating power plant capacity utilization and outages through the WSCC an organization consisting of Defendants and others to inflate the market prices of wholesale electricity in restraint of trade and commerce in California As a result of these efforts Defendants engaged in acts and entered into Agreements which were intended to and have in fact restrained trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity markets in violation of the Antitrust Act which violations are continuing to the present day The aforesaid acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing agreements undertakings and concert of action among Defendants the substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of electricity to the California markets Through these acts and Agreements Defendants acted to set raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of electricity and indirectly and ultimately to California consumers at supracompetitive prices Defendants successfully set raised and maintained supracompetitive wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May to the customers of the California Power Exchange Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity such as Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent Defendants acts contracts agreements combinations and conspiracies were intended to restrain and did in fact restrain trade and commerce in California during the Class Period Defendants unlawful restraints of trade have had and unless enjoined threaten to continue to have the following anticompetitive effects among others a Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale purchasers and ultimately to the customers of SDGE in California have been and will continue to be set raised and maintained at artificially high and noncompetitive levels b Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained and adversely affected and c Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit of free and open competition in the electricity market in California As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open

otherwise paid absent Defendants unlawful conduct Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their irreparable injuries Defendants acts contracts agreements conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act Accordingly Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition which is defined as any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and includes violations of the Cartwright Act oo et seq of the BP Code As alleged hereinabove beginning as early as May defendants unlawfully conspired agreed arranged and combined to prevent and restrain competition for the sale of electricity in violation of oo et seq and oo et seq of the BP Code Pursuant to BP Code oo et seq Plaintiff brings this action seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants unfair trade practices and requiring defendants disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open competition and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases andor charges for

injunction enjoining defendants continuing violations of the Cartwright Act THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act Based Upon Defendants Unfair Business Acts and Practices In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates against all defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Section et seq of the California Business Professions Code prohibits acts of unfair competition which include any unlawful unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of unfair competition as more fully described above by inter alia manipulating the price of wholesale electricity in the California markets In addition pursuant to the Federal Power Act All rates and charges made demanded or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be just and reasonable and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful USC Section da Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the foregoing statute The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable The California Public Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the California wholesale electricity market As a result of the conduct described above the defendants unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the members of the Class Specifically defendants have deprived Plaintiff and the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at unjust excessive and manipulated prices Pursuant to Section of the California Business Professions Code Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a claim in the full amount of all of defendants illgotten gains so as to restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the

injunction restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the market for electricity FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION Unconscionability Against All Defendants Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable given their cost of production the newly emergent markets for that product and the consumers need for electrical power Defendants rates were inherently excessive invalid and unconscionable particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need consumers and businesses have for electrical power Defendants unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by SDGE and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class VI PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as follows a That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a class action and direct that reasonable notice of this action be given to the members of the Class b That the combination contract arrangement agreement conspiracy and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sections and of the California Business and
