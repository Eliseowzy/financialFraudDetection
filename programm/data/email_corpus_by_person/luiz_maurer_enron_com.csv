case study to follow I personally do not believe that the association of distributors is going to strongly stand against this decline in Initial Contracts Afterall there are a monopsony for this cheap

confident to express our Enrons views Those letters are just the tip of the iceberg though Another good subject for us to follow up closely is the Bill of Law It proposes several changes to the electric sector Inter alia there is a proposal to keep bulk energy prices regulated after when the initial contracts start expiring This is detrimental to Enron as it t will delay the implementation of a real wholesale market Keeping most of the energy regulated will certainly have spillover effects on the unregulated business We have already discussed this subject internally We all agree that this proposal is bad for Enron However it may be good for Abradee as the distribution companies will be the only buyers of the cheap regulated energy after Needless to say they will likely support it Some of our collegues are anxious and screaming that Enron should put a stick on the ground Right before I left I prepared a simple white paper to us to use internally and externally It shows that maintaining energy regulated is bad for competition and for expansion Enron has been silent on this issue If necessary I can get this translated It is really important My concern is that Enron will try to look for consensus and we will not be as assertive as we should You may want to probe this issue with our top managers in South America at some points in the future LM Forwarded by Luiz

electron Why not collapse the markets together Certifcates can settle at the MAE and merchant plants can sell industrials the power they need above their meta on bilateral basis Starting with

<7692528.1075844203368.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-07 03:04:00,Intervention in the MAE Cc Sergios and Ricks request please find enclosed a quick summary on the ANEELs intervention in the MAE This note is organized in four main sections a What was it b Initial reactions c Enrons view d Next steps a WHAT WAS IT Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE It has also amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial settlement In terms of structure ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its responsibilities ASMAE is the organization in charge of developing MAEs basic operational functions such as metering contract registering spot price calculation and financial settlement It also has a role in developing the MAE rules an effort which started in November and has not yet come to fruition ASMAE formerly reported to COEX the MAE Board of Directors According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors In terms of governance ANEEL has terminated COEX a stakeholder Board in charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules The Resolution was effective immediately In lieu of COEX ANEEL has created COMAE a new member professional Board in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE rules on an ongoing basis COMAE should be operational in two months ANEELDistributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each Similarly to COEX COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly where all stakeholdershave a seat votes are equally split between generators and distributors In terms of MAE rules ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees Those were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning but they have never been implemented The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature the ones strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running There is a day period to put the new organization and governance in place In the meantime ASMAE will continue its routine functions If doubts arise ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL b INITIAL REACTIONS Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions The Resolutions were issued on a Friday late afternoon to allow agents to dissipate their anger over the weekend The measures were considered a unilateral coupdeetat kind of intervention A lot of criticism was raised on the legality of the process Initial reactions challenged ANEELs ability to intervene in the MAE rules and terminate COEX Similar reactions were expressed the following week A COEX meeting void in legal terms was held the following week to verbalize peoples angers and discuss next steps An immediate General Assembly was scheduled Several COEX members got really upset Reasons vary some are questioning the necessity of those actions although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic body Some COEX member got very emotional afterall their hierarchical positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted by being a COEX member ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX whose members are motivated by more parochial views The meeting was useful and most of the negative reaction was placated No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL Most stakeholders agree that something had to be done despite the fact that the way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity The issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement containing the basic mandates and addressing utilitys concerns c Enrons view Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed Enron has publicly and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE implementation In Informativo Regulatrio issued back in November we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems Nothing was being decided COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than two years without success No one except a few including Enron was interested in getting MAE up and running Rather most agents were interested in conforming the MAE rules to meet their adhoc individual parochial interests The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear nave retreat to objectives Procrastination was the rule of the game In sum COEX was not working The California experience served to surface and enlighten the maladies of stakeholders Board In several instances we proposed a professional Board and some form of ANEELs intervention as it had the ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market R ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account Regulatory Affairs is proud to have influenced this process However we think ANEEL should have acted a long time ago ANEEL now has a sense of urgency It fully understands that a nonfunctioning market would be an obstacle to anyones building new short term generation on a merchant basis This incremental generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a coupdeetat Legally speaking it is also questionable ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy and by other Federally owned generations who have many votes in the MAE Despite those deficiencies we believe the changes are in the right direction ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our individual support as well as to use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of ABRADEE APINE CBIEE and ABRACEEL to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market Agreement in place Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is The only way to proceed is to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE Agreement to be signed by all parties This would require ANEEL some willingness to negotiate and compromise They accepted our suggestion We have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the MAE rules spot pricing and contracts Our support is contingent on the integrity of market and contracts even during a serious rationing The impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to further interfere set caps on spot and the like We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and proposing changes improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement There are many aspects which need to be clarifiedimproved in the new governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL For example the hierarchical lines between ANEEL COMAE ANEEL General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need clarification Similarly the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to be implemented We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry players asking for inputs and feedback No one is really focused on the new MAE Agreement Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time However we feel that some progress has been made Coalition groups are not talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds This is unlikely to happen on an individual basis The situation is relatively under control d Next Steps Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger there is still a long way to go Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions distributed to industry players should be technically discussed and agreed COMAE members should be appointed ideally utilities should agree on the COMAE members specs on a slate of candidates and on a process for final COMAE members selection Finally a new MAE Agreement should be signed None of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint ANEEL has established a day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens ANEEL itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they are We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats one or two to be appointed by traders So far this group has not been represented in the COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups We feel traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale compatition Collectively they avoid competition and therefore the implementation of the market Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate competition on a genuine basis All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months

<16753707.1075844208949.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-18 14:01:00,Facing difficultiesAs you know the energy sector is facing several challenges MAE intervention rationing drafting a new market agreement and the like It is all happening as we speak In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders I have defended correct economic signals have a functioning MAE keeping market rules stable creating wholesale and retail competition honoring contract sanctity and the like More importantly that rationing should not be an excuse for revoking supply and demand Those are not ideologic positions only They represent in my view the best interest for Enron in the short medium and long terms We have already agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee That means I am in fact wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enrons best interests Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest among many others a By defending contract sanctity we defended Elektros contractual position on Annex V which sets a formula on how financial contracts decline during rationing Simulations have indicated that our long position even during the deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues On the contraty wo Annex V loss of EBITDA may be US million in b By defending the integrity of MAE spot prices and the like we are paving the road for Eletrobolts success Needless to say Abraceel message has been consistent across the board For example if one believes on markets we have to defend the use of market signals economic incentivespenalties during rationing And prices to allocate a scarce resource Also as a corollary no intervention in spot prices which will in turn make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible I feel very comfortable in defending Enrons interests and wearing my Abraceel hat There is a positive synergy However Orlando is the President of ABRADEE the Brazilian Association of Distributors The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free market seldom are nor they are the interests of Enron For example ABRADEE as a group criticizes the government for changing MAE governance they wanted rolling blackouts instead of economic signals they advocate caps on spot and the like Needless to say there is a potential crash here with some internal reverberations Today the government announced the rationing plan It is based on quotas with an overlay of economic signals tied to wholesale prices This is consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on However ABRADEE wanted rolling blackouts paving the road for eliminating MAE rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures Guess what happened Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the plan and kill it I am convinced that the government made the right decision and we helped influence it The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV radio and other media Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces Last Tuesday I was invited to express our views to the Minister of the Rationing and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is elasticity in demand MAE should work asap intervention was necessary government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot etc Most of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very same meeting The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements of market forces It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days ago where market signals were completely neglected CERA has recently referred to it as a step away from market forces And it was indeed Internally we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron However the situation is getting more complicated as tension increases Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business In sum there is an internal issue going on I do not want to be a trouble maker However I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make things work or at least to try to Our relationship with ANEEL and with the powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent I feel we should take advantage of it and put a stick on the ground That is our culture I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere beside we know that we do not want markets That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last two years with no material results We have remained silent in key issues waiting for this consensus to happen This has been the case for the market intervention The market is misinterpreting our views For example there was a press article today stating that Enron together with AES were dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime stakeholder board What a gross misinterpretation of our views Informativo Regulatorio has conveyed the opposite message and it has inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess They gave us the credit We are still silent on our view waiting for consensus to happen May be I am in too much of a hurry because I am leaving soon But I feel that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen or at least knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon And we are not taking advantage of it I am not expecting any immediate action from you Just for you to be aware on what is going on and share some concerns If you have any comments or any advise please let me know I have even considered to resign Abraceel leadership to avoid future internal conflicts Luiz Maurer
<14727724.1075844209002.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-20 14:13:00,What is Enrons view on ongoing issues in the energy sector Our Enrons list of commandments Cc As we agreed I prepared this list of key regulatory points to be agreed among ourselves The idea is that this list should serve as a basis for Enrons advocacy plan As you pointed out life has been so hectic and we have been in some many battle fields that we did not have too much time to discuss and agree on our update own view Therefore some of us including myself may have lost sight on what is ultimately good to Enron given the complexity of issues and their state of flux Given the potentially conflicting coalitions we are part of this should also serve as a basis for defining our position and role in each of those institutions Finally this could also serve as a basis for our internal and external communication plans Overall Guiding Principles As an overrarching objective for Enron all over the world we defend inter alia markets competition both at retail and wholesale levels contract sanctity free prices and customer choice We will balance our short term and long term interests to maximize company shareholders value We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on shareholders value we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of regulatory support We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests We will select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests In case Enrons interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we are part of we will defend and express our interests individually we will let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately As a consequence of the above the first step is to have our own view If we do not know what the right way is any alternative may look equally good or bad Commandment list Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy Sector in Brazil We want the Wholesale Energy Market MAE to operate effectively asap We acknowledge that COEX the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the last years The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum game issues have prevented COEX to be effective We advocate professional independent boards instead as we do in most markets we participate worldwide Informativo Regulatrio represent our best view on the subject for Brazil Therefore we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix inter alia i the ineffectiveness of COEX by replacing it by COMAE a professional board ii introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years which has resulted in a US million default iii we acknowledge that the Ordinances published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged iv therefore we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to enhance the governance of the new board make MAE the organizational structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not overpenalize our long positions loss sharing v we will do our best to convince our peers about the proposed changes however if the agreed level is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement we will present our view to ANEEL separately vi we will advocate that companies trading in the free market should have a nondiscriminatory treatment within MAE and COMAE vii we will strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the free trading association We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot price even during rationing in fact already capped at about R MWh which represents the embedded cost of deficit This conceptual view is perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro Eletrobolt and wholesale position all of them long We will strongly oppose any government temptation to set additional caps on spot prices On the contrary we will support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit which we believe to be underestimated We have recently supported as strongly suggested by our trading group ANEELs proposal to significantly raise the cost of deficit particularly during rationing We advocate that any caps on spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will aggravate the rationing crisis We defend Contract sanctity In this regard we will fight with Aneel to have the passthrough of noncontrollable costs for Elektro such as power purchases costs Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession contract whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff reviews should not be recovered We defend the idea of a tracking account or a similar mechanism We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend our interests Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity we will defend Annex V which is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon rationing According to several Elektros analysis developed thus far preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro even able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing If Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on the basis of actual load redution as proposed in the rumor mill we will forego US million in terms of EBITDA We will refuse to negotiate with our suppliers eg Duke AES any changes in the Initial Contracts which entail any transfer of riskcosts between generators and distributors We will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted to change the Annex V under the assumption that contract sanctity is being violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty We will also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing plan because of the free ride effect We will not advocate any bailout of companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the impact of Annex V when companies were privatized We will argue that Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore there is not any excuse to change the rules now We will not agree to set additional caps on spot not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is which will represent about US million to Elektro Caps are actually a disguised way of partially revoking Annex V We will support Aneels Resolution recently published whereby any new generation backup self generator no matter its size is allowed to sell to any market player at freely negotiated prices before they could sell to the host utility only Similarly we support any other initiative to give a nondiscriminatory treatment to new generation which should be free to trade energy at freely negotiated basis We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand reduction during rationing To avoid Californias mistakes we will advocate that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices We will advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay of correct economic signals MAE spot prices for those exceding their quotas We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource nor it is effective for a longterm energy rationing as opposed to California where the issue was peak shaving Furthermore as recently pointed out by CERA rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant departure from markets and will open new avenues for market intervention and contract breaches We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand elasticity in electricity prices By linking the success of the rationing program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro We acknowledge that the increase in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the medium term While the financial impact of energy rationing has not been quantified for Elektro we also assume the appetite for markets and energy services may create new business opportunities for Enron We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail competition in proposed threshold level of kW We do not accept a commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail market Instead regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent distribution companies to become stranded by sharing this burden among the captive and free market segments California CTC is an example but government should look at best practices We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to competition in the electricity market Informativo Regulatrio We will also advocate for open access in the pipelines We will express our contrary views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobrs role as the sole gas supplier in order to avoid effective competition in the natural gas We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to the government able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term We will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory risks faced by generators and distributors We will express our views on how to create a healthy contracting environment to foster competition and expand capacity We will oppose any measures which create a nonlevel playing field both at the production or consumption side If emergency actions are needed they should be used on a temporary basis only eg Petrobrs being the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge Finally we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to or at least try to get the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry We acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and that the competitive model has not worked We will express our opposite views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead We acknowlege that it will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse partiesinterests COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process Given that we should express our coherent market based views to the Government We will use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude strengthens our points of view In case conflicts emerge we will preserve the coherence of our ideas as a whole LM

Seminar promoted by ABCE The first topic presented by ABCEs President by the opening of the S eminar was the importance of the maintenance of the Annex V of the Initial Contracts Among other matters it was discussed during the event the C oncession Contract and Rationing Prof Caio Tcito one of the most well known and respected scholars was one of the speakers According with him the losses in sales and revenues that the DCs will suffer as a result of the cut of the load may be recovered by DCs based on the principle of th e reestablishment of the economicfinancial balancing equilibrium of the concession agreement Prof Tcito further emphasized his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa sum that is to be collected should be reserv ed in favor of the DCs so as to compensate partially such losses Finall y Mr Tcito suggested that in order to avoid legal controversies the Go vernment could alternatively conceive using the surcharge sobretarifa collected as future credits to be used by consumers when rationing is ov erDavid Watenberg also ratified such understanding He further expressed his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa has no legal grounds to sur vive This is so because

willing to listen to us I think we should not be afraid of putting a stick on the ground as necessary I know that Mario Arce got upset with me and I did not mean it However he has to know that if he comes up with some precooked crazy ideas Kill Annex V caps on spot he will have to face the discipline of the media He or any other has to know that we will do whatever is necessary to get our ideas

full time ASMAE employee was expressing her distorted views to the press on why generating companies should not abide by Annex V She was not speaking on behalf of ASMAE however she was probably reflecting ASMAE view I did not mean to shoot the messenger but I could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion There are two problems in Patricias view She is not supposed to express any views on contracts MAE should only settle contracts but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAEs frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II Furnas conflict in the last months Informativo Regulatrio explores the issue in more detail She was dead wrong Quite nave arguments A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V we may use externally as you see fit Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts So what It is a regulated contract by nature as so many others such as CUST CUSD CCT CCD Does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions So what I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms it is by definition an adhesion contract Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement provisions Guess what the answer was None Some Gs did not sign Annex V eg Furnas which apparently disobeyed Annels instructions as per Law This is serious That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract those Gs do not want to abide by Law No response Some companies do not have Annex V So what Discussion is about Annex V Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts Ttariff energy price was not subject to negotiation as part of the Initial Contracts therefore they were not able to price the risk represented by Annex V So what Many contracts have regulated prices All use of system contracts have regulated prices Furthermore the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V risk Why giving them a windfall now Since it is a zero sum game a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch Wrong ERM Mecanismo de Realocao de Energia was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing It is called dry period relief clause It was proposed by the generators and approved by Annel The spot price is a proxy for the depth of rationing One should not evoke rationing I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is bullet proof In the meantime let me share my views There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on the ridiculous proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in junk bonds We should make this clear at the outset We should make Minister Patente realize that Mario Arces proposal is nonsense Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and FonteCindam and became a public scandal If we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven If we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs Crisis will get worse and worse Generators should have the burden of proof In the meantime Annex V is effective and should be enforceable Regarding California case as mentioned by Mario Arce It is a totally different situation In California DCs were not allowed to contract In Brazil they were strongly encouraged Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex VThey did not They acted irresponsibly They secondguessed regulations They did not help in expanding capacity They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V The argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals Some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition And hopefully someone has to go bankrupt This will be a great lesson People will start taking market signals more seriously Otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a market We have to be as transparent as possible Finally I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week I volunteer to prepare a first draft if you guys agree it is a good idea LM

setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and FonteCindam and became a public scandal If we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven If we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs Crisis will get worse and worse Generators should have the burden of proof In the meantime Annex V is effective and should be enforceable Regarding California case as mentioned by Mario Arce It is a totally different situation In California DCs were not allowed to contract In Brazil they were strongly encouraged Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex VThey did not They acted irresponsibly They secondguessed regulations They did not help in expanding capacity They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V The argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals Some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition And hopefully someone has to go bankrupt This will be a great lesson People will start taking market signals more seriously Otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a

refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion There are two problems in Patricias view She is not supposed to express any views on contracts MAE should only settle contracts but never attempt to

ticity to demand in the absence of full retail competition or under emerg ency situations such as rationing when the regulator may establish that a ll customers recieve price signals above a certain baseline consumption I would dare to say that even less than of load being price sensitive on a time interval basis would have a significant impact on price spikes and therefore on the entire logic for payment for capacityreserves CERA has just produced an interesting report In the Northeast US NY has had th e best demand response despite being a few thousand MW they may have alli viated significant curtailment One may hypothesize why customer response h as been so modest in genera One possible explanation is that under the t hreat of rolling blackouts customers do not want to face the inconvenien ce and investments or responding to demand Situation may change in the f uture as they get used and perceive the real benefits of participating in t his game That is why our ICAP paper relies heavily on demand response to m ake sure that the market will always clear As far as the LSE holding forward call options as an intermediary solu tion I think this is an idea originally developed by Oren from Berkeley He basically states that LSEs or large industries should decide their de sired exposure to the spot price by holding more or less of those options Options should be backed by real generation in this case reserves In Or ens view this avoids the syndrome of one size fits all Instead of all pl ayers buying for the same reliability level the scheme would allow each pa rticipant to customize their risk preferences This idea only makes sense i f you impose a contracting requirement on LSEs otherwise the freeride pr oblem would still be there and because of the risk of curtailment the marke t would not be able to clear In earlier versions of our Icap paper we dr afted this idea as a possible alternative I can send you older versions i f you want to go further into the subject However Larry Ruff and some of our trading guys disliked the concept of any kind of mandatory contract re quirement which I understand goes hand in hand with the call option propos al If we had to choose Larry would rather go for the British LOLP x VLL model instead of the mandatory contract requirement To be fully consistent with our paper you should state our interim proposa l and explain why it is superior to the former UK model LOLP or the Oren s proposal mandatory requirement Or alternatively you should stress t hat Orens idea only works if you impose a mandatory contracting requiremen t over and above your forecasted load LM Original Message From Walton Steve Sent Thu PM To Novosel Sarah Roan Michael Perrino Dave Maurer Luiz Hueter Bar bara A

A Landwehr Susan M Hoatson Tom Nicolay Chri sti L Steffes James D Alvarez Ray Shelk John Rodriquez Andy Subject RE RTO Week Comments ICAP The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that so me type of long term capacity obligation is needed as long as demand is no t very price responsive in order to allow generation to recover its fixed costs and support investment The report also notes that some panelists support a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward ca ll options on energy and a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand become price responsive I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our r esponse see below but I have a couple of questions for this group We say in our comments that a real time energy market thro ugh an RTO will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve beca use they will see real time prices However if a state ha s a rate freeze in effect andor if retail access is not permitted in a sta te how can retail load respond to the RTOs real time spot marke t prices We need to include this response in our comments What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement Your thoughts are greatly appreciated Also any thoughts you have on othe r parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated thanks Dave Perin o for sending you comments Thanks Everyone Sarah EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requi rements Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations RT Os that encompass robust competitive spot markets for energy and operati ng reserve products including demand side management products will provid e an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generat ion the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand sid e management products to ensure that demand is met in real time Spot mark ets reveal the cost of procuring or not using electricity based on actua l supply and demand conditions and thus signal the need for new generatio n capacity They also ensure that consumers see the cost of procurement decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based on discovered prices These markets will keep supply and demand in balanc e in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning cri teria Therefore there is no need to continue separate installed capacity requirements in an RTO environment The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is new to the electricity industry Regulated consumers have historically pai d utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions These regulated tarif fs provide little if any meaningful supplydemand price information to th e consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the u nderlying cost of doing so has been high As a result demand curves hav e been categorized as inelastic or vertical suggesting the need for ca pacity related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will for the first time give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need f or specific capacity related payments as supplydemand interaction and cur tailment will be based on economic choices

importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implementaion of wholesale markets RTO participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well You included some elements of this topic under the title An Installed capacity requirement is not necessary It does fit under this title but I think it is more than that Perhaps a separate item A few possible additional points a Demand response has been very limited so far because customers have been under a regulatory shield b A few attempts to make load see correct prices have been very encouraging There is still a long way to go though c There has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices eg DSB d Wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways such as i increased chances for the market to clear at all times ii mitigate price spikes and as a consequence the need for caps iii proxy for reserves e It will take some time to get demand response In the meantime some interim measures may be necessary such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments your footnote to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level f Even for this interim period we do not support caps By not having caps the rationale for capacity payment disappears FERC will deal with market power if any on an adhoc basism by not allowing market based rates instead of caps This is the approach MISO has been taking and we agreed with it What about including the text A well designed RTO as an attachment the one recently prepared by Janel Hydro I agree with your point that LMP may work in a hydro based system The only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade In that case plants are not free to bid there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management The marginal price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process but it is the shadow price of an optimization program This very same price could be the basis for the LMP Not a big deal Hydro plants do not like LMP because in general they are far away from consumer centers and LMP with technical losses penalizes them a lot We should stick to our point that LMP should be used across all RTOs Still on LMP on the northwest page second paragraph I agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out For example generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum or maximum requirements However I would not call this allowing bilateral contracts I would call it accomodate must run requirements caused by operational inflexibilities for example if a run of river plant decides to be merchant it still should have the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run Still on LMP for hydro I am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the Northwest RTO Steve Walton to confirm Otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page I think David suggested to use the NY example I am not familiar with Capacity Payment Page last paragraph Finally any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a specitc generator as a physical product I know what you meant but it may lead to dubious interpretations It may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures If we were able to get property rights on reliability issues the capacity fee discussion wouuld be a nobrainer I would eliminate the sentence Capacity Payment Page last paragraph our white paper on capacity footnote does not clearly say that the RTO should the purchasing agent during the interim period It may be the case provider of last resource but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution What we can certainly say is that in the interim period the RTO should be responsible for system adequacy plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all Control Areas as opposed to having each one of them working independently Sorry for

intervention in the MAE This note is organized in four main sections a What was it b Initial reactions c Enrons view d Next steps a WHAT WAS IT Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE It has also amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial settlement In terms of structure ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its responsibilities ASMAE is the organization in charge of developing MAEs basic operational functions such as metering contract registering spot price calculation and financial settlement It also has a role in developing the MAE rules an effort which started in November and has not yet come to fruition ASMAE formerly reported to COEX the MAE Board of Directors According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors In terms of governance ANEEL has terminated COEX a stakeholder Board in charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules The Resolution was effective immediately In lieu of COEX ANEEL has created COMAE a new member professional Board in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE rules on an ongoing basis COMAE should be operational in two months ANEELDistributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each Similarly to COEX COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly where all stakeholdershave a seat votes are equally split between generators and distributors In terms of MAE rules ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees Those were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning but they have never been implemented The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature the ones strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running There is a day period to put the new organization and governance in place In the meantime ASMAE will continue its routine functions If doubts arise ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL b INITIAL REACTIONS Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions The Resolutions were issued on a Friday late afternoon to allow agents to dissipate their anger over the weekend The measures were considered a unilateral coupdeetat kind of intervention A lot of criticism was raised on the legality of the process Initial reactions challenged ANEELs ability to intervene in the MAE rules and terminate COEX Similar reactions were expressed the following week A COEX meeting void in legal terms was held the following week to verbalize peoples angers and discuss next steps An immediate General Assembly was scheduled Several COEX members got really upset Reasons vary some are questioning the necessity of those actions although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic body Some COEX member got very emotional afterall their hierarchical positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted by being a COEX member ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX whose members are motivated by more parochial views The meeting was useful and most of the negative reaction was placated No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL Most stakeholders agree that something had to be done despite the fact that the way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity The issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement containing the basic mandates and addressing utilitys concerns c Enrons view Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed Enron has publicly and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE implementation In Informativo Regulatrio issued back in November we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems Nothing was being decided COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than two years without success No one except a few including Enron was interested in getting MAE up and running Rather most agents were interested in conforming the MAE rules to meet their adhoc individual parochial interests The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear nave retreat to objectives Procrastination was the rule of the game In sum COEX was not working The California experience served to surface and enlighten the maladies of stakeholders Board In several instances we proposed a professional Board and some form of ANEELs intervention as it had the ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market R ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account Regulatory Affairs is proud to have influenced this process However we think ANEEL should have acted a long time ago ANEEL now has a sense of urgency It fully understands that a nonfunctioning market would be an obstacle to anyones building new short term generation on a merchant basis This incremental generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a coupdeetat Legally speaking it is also questionable ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy and by other Federally owned generations who have many votes in the MAE Despite those deficiencies we believe the changes are in the right direction ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our individual support as well as to use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of ABRADEE APINE CBIEE and ABRACEEL to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market Agreement in place Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is The only way to proceed is to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE Agreement to be signed by all parties This would require ANEEL some willingness to negotiate and compromise They accepted our suggestion We have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the MAE rules spot pricing and contracts Our support is contingent on the integrity of market and contracts even during a serious rationing The impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to further interfere set caps on spot and the like We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and proposing changes improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement There are many aspects which need to be clarifiedimproved in the new governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL For example the hierarchical lines between ANEEL COMAE ANEEL General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need clarification Similarly the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to be implemented We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry players asking for inputs and feedback No one is really focused on the new MAE Agreement Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time However we feel that some progress has been made Coalition groups are not talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds This is unlikely to happen on an individual basis The situation is relatively under control d Next Steps Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger there is still a long way to go Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions distributed to industry players should be technically discussed and agreed COMAE members should be appointed ideally utilities should agree on the COMAE members specs on a slate of candidates and on a process for final COMAE members selection Finally a new MAE Agreement should be signed None of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint ANEEL has established a day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens ANEEL itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they are We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats one or two to be appointed by traders So far this group has not been represented in the COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups We feel traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale compatition Collectively they avoid competition and therefore the implementation of the market Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate competition on a genuine basis All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months

drafting a new market agreement and the like It is all happening as we speak In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders I have defended correct economic signals have a functioning MAE keeping market rules stable creating wholesale and retail competition honoring contract sanctity and the like More importantly that rationing should not be an excuse for revoking supply and demand Those are not ideologic positions only They represent in my view the best interest for Enron in the short medium and long terms We have already agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee That means I am in fact wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enrons best interests Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest among many others a By defending contract sanctity we defended Elektros contractual position on Annex V which sets a formula on how financial contracts decline during rationing Simulations have indicated that our long position even during the deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues On the contraty wo Annex V loss of EBITDA may be US million in b By defending the integrity of MAE spot prices and the like we are paving the road for Eletrobolts success Needless to say Abraceel message has been consistent across the board For example if one believes on markets we have to defend the use of market signals economic incentivespenalties during rationing And prices to allocate a scarce resource Also as a corollary no intervention in spot prices which will in turn make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible I feel very comfortable in defending Enrons interests and wearing my Abraceel hat There is a positive synergy However Orlando is the President of ABRADEE the Brazilian Association of Distributors The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free market seldom are nor they are the interests of Enron For example ABRADEE as a group criticizes the government for changing MAE governance they wanted rolling blackouts instead of economic signals they advocate caps on spot and the like Needless to say there is a potential crash here with some internal reverberations Today the government announced the rationing plan It is based on quotas with an overlay of economic signals tied to wholesale prices This is consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on However ABRADEE wanted rolling blackouts paving the road for eliminating MAE rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures Guess what happened Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the plan and kill it I am convinced that the government made the right decision and we helped influence it The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV radio and other media Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces Last Tuesday I was invited to express our views to the Minister of the Rationing and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is elasticity in demand MAE should work asap intervention was necessary government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot etc Most of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very same meeting The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements of market forces It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days ago where market signals were completely neglected CERA has recently referred to it as a step away from market forces And it was indeed Internally we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron However the situation is getting more complicated as tension increases Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business In sum there is an internal issue going on I do not want to be a trouble maker However I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make things work or at least to try to Our relationship with ANEEL and with the powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent I feel we should take advantage of it and put a stick on the ground That is our culture I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere beside we know that we do not want markets That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last two years with no material results We have remained silent in key issues waiting for this consensus to happen This has been the case for the market intervention The market is misinterpreting our views For example there was a press article today stating that Enron together with AES were dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime stakeholder board What a gross misinterpretation of our views Informativo Regulatorio has conveyed the opposite message and it has inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess They gave us the credit We are still silent on our view waiting for consensus to happen May be I am in too much of a hurry because I am leaving soon But I feel that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen or at least knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon And we are not taking advantage of it I am not expecting any immediate action from you Just for you to be aware on what is going on and share some concerns If you have any comments or any advise please let me know I have even considered to resign Abraceel leadership to avoid future internal conflicts Luiz Maurer

have been in some many battle fields that we did not have too much time to discuss and agree on our update own view Therefore some of us including myself may have lost sight on what is ultimately good to Enron given the complexity of issues and their state of flux Given the potentially conflicting coalitions we are part of this should also serve as a basis for defining our position and role in each

shareholders value We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on shareholders value we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of regulatory support We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests We will select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests In case Enrons interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we are part of we will defend and express our interests individually we will let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately As a consequence of the above the first step is to have our own view If we do not know what the right way is any alternative may look equally good or bad Commandment list Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy Sector in Brazil We want the Wholesale Energy Market MAE to operate effectively asap We acknowledge that COEX the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the last years The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum game issues have prevented COEX to be effective We advocate professional independent boards instead as we do in most markets we participate worldwide Informativo Regulatrio represent our best view on the subject for Brazil Therefore we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix inter alia i the ineffectiveness of COEX by replacing it by COMAE a professional board ii introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years which has resulted in a US million default iii we acknowledge that the Ordinances published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged iv therefore we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to enhance the governance of the new board make MAE the organizational structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not overpenalize our long positions loss sharing v we will do our best to convince our peers about the proposed changes however if the agreed level is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement we will present our view to ANEEL separately vi we will advocate that companies trading in the free market should have a nondiscriminatory treatment within MAE and COMAE vii we will strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the free trading association We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot price even during rationing in fact already capped at about R MWh which represents the embedded cost of deficit This conceptual view is perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro Eletrobolt and wholesale position all of them long We will strongly oppose any government temptation to set additional caps on spot prices On the contrary we will support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit which we believe to be underestimated We have recently supported as strongly suggested by our trading group ANEELs proposal to significantly raise the cost of deficit particularly during rationing We advocate that any caps on spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will aggravate the rationing crisis We defend Contract sanctity In this regard we will fight with Aneel to have the passthrough of noncontrollable costs for Elektro such as power purchases costs Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession contract whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff reviews should not be recovered We defend the idea of a tracking account or a similar mechanism We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend our interests Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity we will defend Annex V which is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon rationing According to several Elektros analysis developed thus far preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro even able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing If Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on the basis of actual load redution as proposed in the rumor mill we will forego US million in terms of EBITDA We will refuse to negotiate with our suppliers eg Duke AES any changes in the Initial Contracts which entail any transfer of riskcosts between generators and distributors We will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted to change the Annex V under the assumption that contract sanctity is being violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty We will also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing plan because of the free ride effect We will not advocate any bailout of companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the impact of Annex V when companies were privatized We will argue that Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore there is not any excuse to change the rules now We will not agree to set additional caps on spot not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is which will represent about US million to Elektro Caps are actually a disguised way of partially revoking Annex V We will support Aneels Resolution recently published whereby any new generation backup self generator no matter its size is allowed to sell to any market player at freely negotiated prices before they could sell to the host utility only Similarly we support any other initiative to give a nondiscriminatory treatment to new generation which should be free to trade energy at freely negotiated basis We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand reduction during rationing To avoid Californias mistakes we will advocate that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices We will advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay of correct economic signals MAE spot prices for those exceding their quotas We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource nor it is effective for a longterm energy rationing as opposed to California where the issue was peak shaving Furthermore as recently pointed out by CERA rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant departure from markets and will open new avenues for market intervention and contract breaches We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand elasticity in electricity prices By linking the success of the rationing program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro We acknowledge that the increase in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the medium term While the financial impact of energy rationing has not been quantified for Elektro we also assume the appetite for markets and energy services may create new business opportunities for Enron We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail competition in proposed threshold level of kW We do not accept a commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail market Instead regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent distribution companies to become stranded by sharing this burden among the captive and free market segments California CTC is an example but government should look at best practices We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to competition in the electricity market Informativo Regulatrio We will also advocate for open access in the pipelines We will express our contrary views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobrs role as the sole gas supplier in order to avoid effective competition in the natural gas We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to the government able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term We will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory risks faced by generators and distributors We will express our views on how to create a healthy contracting environment to foster competition and expand capacity We will oppose any measures which create a nonlevel playing field both at the production or consumption side If emergency actions are needed they should be used on a temporary basis only eg Petrobrs being the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge Finally we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to or at least try to get the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry We acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and that the competitive model has not worked We will express our opposite views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead We acknowlege that it will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse partiesinterests COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process Given that we should express our coherent market based views to the Government We will use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude strengthens our points of view In case conflicts emerge we will preserve the coherence of our ideas as a whole LM

Seminar promoted by ABCE The first topic presented by ABCEs President by the opening of the S eminar was the importance of the maintenance of the Annex V of the Initial Contracts Among other matters it was discussed during the event the C oncession Contract and Rationing Prof Caio Tcito one of the most well known and respected scholars was one of the speakers According with him the losses in sales and revenues that the DCs will suffer as a result of the cut of the load may be recovered by DCs based on the principle of th e reestablishment of the economicfinancial balancing equilibrium of the concession agreement Prof Tcito further emphasized his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa sum that is to be collected should be reserv ed in favor of the DCs so as to compensate partially such losses Finall y Mr Tcito suggested that in order to avoid legal controversies the Go vernment could alternatively conceive using the surcharge sobretarifa collected as future credits to be used by consumers when rationing is ov erDavid Watenberg also ratified such understanding He further expressed his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa has no legal grounds to sur vive This is so because

exposures in the MAE An Abradee group was created to think about the issue Joao and Fred will participate tomorrow A few supporting arguments Contract sanctity Why changing the rules in the middle of the game if Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing conditions More subtle argument The risk of being exposed is the only economic incentive for a DC to reduce its load Otherwise we will have a classica l free ride problem DCs will not put any effort to reduce their loadsrevenues and will advocate for an expost adjustment on ICs based on verified load reduction We can build a case that in the absence of this exposure DCs will have no incentives to work hand in hand with their clients to foster load reduction and the whole program will fail Debora is working on the legal

reflecting ASMAE view I did not mean to shoot the messenger but I could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion There are two problems in Patricias view She is not supposed to express any views on contracts MAE should only settle contracts but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAEs frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II Furnas conflict in the last months Informativo Regulatrio explores the issue in more detail She was dead wrong Quite nave arguments A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V we may use externally as you see fit Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts So what It is a regulated contract by nature as so many others such as CUST CUSD CCT CCD Does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions So what I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms it is by definition an adhesion contract Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement provisions Guess what the answer was None Some Gs did not sign Annex V eg Furnas which apparently disobeyed Annels instructions as per Law This is serious That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract those Gs do not want to abide by Law No response Some companies do not have Annex V So what Discussion is about Annex V Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts Ttariff energy price was not subject to negotiation as part of the Initial Contracts therefore they were not able to price the risk represented by Annex V So what Many contracts have regulated prices All use of system contracts have regulated prices Furthermore the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V risk Why giving them a windfall now Since it is a zero sum game a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch Wrong ERM Mecanismo de Realocao de Energia was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing It is called dry period relief clause It was proposed by the generators and approved by Annel The spot price is a proxy for the depth of rationing One should not evoke rationing I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is bullet proof In the meantime let me share my views There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on the ridiculous proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in junk bonds We should make this clear at the outset We should make Minister Patente realize that Mario Arces proposal is nonsense Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and FonteCindam and became a public scandal If we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven If we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs Crisis will get worse and worse Generators should have the burden of proof In the meantime Annex V is effective and should be enforceable Regarding California case as mentioned by Mario Arce It is a totally different situation In California DCs were not allowed to contract In Brazil they were strongly encouraged Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex VThey did not They acted irresponsibly They secondguessed regulations They did not help in expanding capacity They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V The argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals Some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition And hopefully someone has to go bankrupt This will be a great lesson People will start taking market signals more seriously Otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a market We have to be as transparent as possible Finally I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V and caps on spot and deliver it to

compromise between true market incentives and political pressures I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE eg there is no substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price signals credit integrity and timely cash settlement I WOULD NOT make the resolution of Angra II a precondition for the continuing wellbeing of the MAE Lets just get the market working

Subject ASMAE taking the wrong view on Annex X Ignorance or bad faith Last Friday Patricia Arce Mario Arces daughter and a full time ASMAE employee was expressing her distorted views to the press on why generating companies should not abide by Annex V She was not speaking on behalf of ASMAE however she was probably reflecting ASMAE view I did not mean to shoot the messenger but I could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion There are two problems in Patricias view She is not supposed to express any views on contracts MAE should only settle contracts but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAEs frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II Furnas conflict in the last months Informativo Regulatrio explores the issue in more detail She was dead wrong Quite nave arguments A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V we may use externally as you see fit Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts So what It is a regulated contract by nature as so many others such as CUST CUSD CCT CCD Does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions So what I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms it is by definition an adhesion contract Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement provisions Guess what the answer was None Some Gs did not sign Annex V eg Furnas which apparently disobeyed Annels instructions as per Law This is serious That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract those Gs do not want to abide by Law No response Some companies do not have Annex V So what Discussion is about Annex V Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts Ttariff energy price was not subject to negotiation as part of the Initial Contracts therefore they were not able to price the risk represented by Annex V So what Many contracts have regulated prices All use of system contracts have regulated prices Furthermore the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V risk Why giving them a windfall now Since it is a zero sum game a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch Wrong ERM Mecanismo de Realocao de Energia was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing It is called dry period relief clause It was proposed by the generators and approved by Annel The spot price is a proxy for the depth of rationing One should not evoke rationing I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is bullet proof In the meantime let me share my views There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on the ridiculous proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in junk bonds We should make this clear at the outset We should make Minister Patente realize that Mario Arces proposal is nonsense Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and FonteCindam and became a public scandal If we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven If we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs Crisis will get worse and worse Generators should have the burden of proof In the meantime Annex V is effective and should be enforceable Regarding California case as mentioned by Mario Arce It is a totally different situation In California DCs were not allowed to contract In Brazil they were strongly encouraged Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex VThey did not They acted irresponsibly They secondguessed regulations They did not help in expanding capacity They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V The argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals Some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition And hopefully someone has to go bankrupt This will be a great lesson People will start taking market signals more seriously Otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a market We have to be as transparent as possible Finally I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week I volunteer to prepare a first draft if you guys agree it is a good idea LM

multitiered and that even the first tier should be higher I also wouldnt concede that changing the cost of defecit is a change of the rules Nevertheless leaving it where it is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political pressures I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE eg there is no substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price signals credit integrity and timely cash settlement I WOULD NOT make the resolution of Angra II a precondition for the continuing wellbeing of the MAE Lets just get the market working now eg governance penaltiesguaranties accounting on an ongoing basis I think that the issue of Angra II can be treated separately Given the current discussion visavis the constitutionality of

in the same boat We share the same ideas as well The only difference is perhaps the approach I am kind of skeptical of negotiating with those guys COEX has been a two year failure in terms of consensus building Where has consensus led us Nowhere After some point it is worthless discussing with those guys I know that you have been standing and fighting You are probably right when you say I am being radical Given my skepticism I think there are only two ways i going straight to Pedro Parente ii or a big splash in the media because we have a coherent story there are always many reporters willing to listen to us I think we should not be afraid of putting a stick on the ground as necessary I know that Mario Arce got upset with me and I did not mean it However he has to know that if he comes up with some precooked crazy ideas Kill Annex V caps on spot he will have to face the discipline of the media He or any other has to know that we will do whatever is necessary to get our ideas across It is a war No time for consensus building or for being the nice guy They are writing new laws as we speak There is a strong sense of urgency It is a make it or break it situation This is my modest view only LM Joao Carlos Albuquerque PM To Joe nron David M nron Luiz nron Fred nron cc Orlando nron Sergio nron Fred nron Britaldo nron Brett R nron Remi nron Subject Re CAP no MAE David and

the appearance of supporting price caps I cant think of any other situation anywhere in the world where Enron has supported price caps in a market To the contrary we are almost always public in our opposition to such marketkilling sophistry Consensus is a noble objective but sometimes it is just better to let people know your true opinion DMR Luiz Maurer To Joao Carlos nron cc Orlando nron Sergio nron Fred nron Britaldo nron Brett R nron Remi nron David M nron Subject Re CAP no MAE I strongly disagree If it is impossible to reach an agreement within ABRADEE then we should be loud an clear in expressing our own view to all levels of government including a position paper to Pedro Parente asap Caps at this point in time may jeopardize the rationing plan per se We had a victory in anchoring the penalties to the MAE price Why surrender it now Why do we have to abide by ABRADEEs desires This is not a religious issue only There are a few US million left on the table How many US million are on the table for Enron Ballpark possibly USf or Elektros long position in EBITDA A lot lot more for Eletrobolt perhaps to the point of killing the project as Joao Albuquerque stated Are we being consistent About a week ago we submitted our views to ANEEL on Public Hearing advocating for an increase in the cost of defict to US MWh The trading group Remi David were adamant about this

Seminar promoted by ABCE The first topic presented by ABCEs President by the opening of the S eminar was the importance of the maintenance of the Annex V of the Initial Contracts Among other matters it was discussed during the event the C oncession Contract and Rationing Prof Caio Tcito one of the most well known and respected scholars was one of the speakers According with him the losses in sales and revenues that the DCs will suffer as a result of the cut of the load may be recovered by DCs based on the principle of th e reestablishment of the economicfinancial balancing equilibrium of the concession agreement Prof Tcito further emphasized his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa sum that is to be collected should be reserv ed in favor of the DCs so as to compensate partially such losses Finall y Mr Tcito suggested that in order to avoid legal controversies the Go vernment could alternatively conceive using the surcharge sobretarifa collected as future credits to be used by consumers when rationing is ov erDavid Watenberg also ratified such understanding He further expressed his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa has no legal grounds to sur vive This is so because

preserve US million in EBITDA for Elektro in Luiz Travesso AES was quite aggressive last Saturday in trying to convinc e me otherwise Needless to say he did not My view was to defend contract sanctity which for him is a minor detail He screamed loudly and swore to God he was not going to pay if Tiete gets short I said he would better discuss this issue in court as opposed to killing the messenger Demostenes AES defended the idea that ANNEX V is a risk sharing mechanism between Gs and Ds and because of this those should sit down again and agree on a new risk allocation mechanism This is wrong I helped design Annex V The only reason why ANNEX V is there is to mitigate the isk for generators not distributors statistically a generator will not able to deliver its assured energy in out of years Any amendment to Annex V will push riskscosts back to Elektro The argument that rules are being changed is weak No rules are being changed Annex V was part of the initial contracts and prices accordingly When Luiz Travesso replied that he overvalued Tiet during its privatization because he did not take Annex V into account I expressed my sympathy I told him to hire more competent

<27866962.1075852032174.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-20 14:13:00,What is Enrons view on ongoing issues in the energy sector Our Enrons list of commandments Cc As we agreed I prepared this list of key regulatory points to be agreed among ourselves The idea is that this list should serve as a basis for Enrons advocacy plan As you pointed out life has been so hectic and we have been in some many battle fields that we did not have too much time to discuss and agree on our update own view Therefore some of us including myself may have lost sight on what is ultimately good to Enron given the complexity of issues and their state of flux Given the potentially conflicting coalitions we are part of this should also serve as a basis for defining our position and role in each of those institutions Finally this could also serve as a basis for our internal and external communication plans Overall Guiding Principles As an overrarching objective for Enron all over the world we defend inter alia markets competition both at retail and wholesale levels contract sanctity free prices and customer choice We will balance our short term and long term interests to maximize company shareholders value We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on shareholders value we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of regulatory support We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests We will select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests In case Enrons interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we are part of we will defend and express our interests individually we will let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately As a consequence of the above the first step is to have our own view If we do not know what the right way is any alternative may look equally good or bad Commandment list Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy Sector in Brazil We want the Wholesale Energy Market MAE to operate effectively asap We acknowledge that COEX the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the last years The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum game issues have prevented COEX to be effective We advocate professional independent boards instead as we do in most markets we participate worldwide Informativo Regulatrio represent our best view on the subject for Brazil Therefore we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix inter alia i the ineffectiveness of COEX by replacing it by COMAE a professional board ii introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years which has resulted in a US million default iii we acknowledge that the Ordinances published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged iv therefore we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to enhance the governance of the new board make MAE the organizational structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not overpenalize our long positions loss sharing v we will do our best to convince our peers about the proposed changes however if the agreed level is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement we will present our view to ANEEL separately vi we will advocate that companies trading in the free market should have a nondiscriminatory treatment within MAE and COMAE vii we will strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the free trading association We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot price even during rationing in fact already capped at about R MWh which represents the embedded cost of deficit This conceptual view is perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro Eletrobolt and wholesale position all of them long We will strongly oppose any government temptation to set additional caps on spot prices On the contrary we will support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit which we believe to be underestimated We have recently supported as strongly suggested by our trading group ANEELs proposal to significantly raise the cost of deficit particularly during rationing We advocate that any caps on spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will aggravate the rationing crisis We defend Contract sanctity In this regard we will fight with Aneel to have the passthrough of noncontrollable costs for Elektro such as power purchases costs Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession contract whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff reviews should not be recovered We defend the idea of a tracking account or a similar mechanism We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend our interests Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity we will defend Annex V which is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon rationing According to several Elektros analysis developed thus far preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro even able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing If Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on the basis of actual load redution as proposed in the rumor mill we will forego US million in terms of EBITDA We will refuse to negotiate with our suppliers eg Duke AES any changes in the Initial Contracts which entail any transfer of riskcosts between generators and distributors We will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted to change the Annex V under the assumption that contract sanctity is being violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty We will also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing plan because of the free ride effect We will not advocate any bailout of companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the impact of Annex V when companies were privatized We will argue that Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore there is not any excuse to change the rules now We will not agree to set additional caps on spot not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is which will represent about US million to Elektro Caps are actually a disguised way of partially revoking Annex V We will support Aneels Resolution recently published whereby any new generation backup self generator no matter its size is allowed to sell to any market player at freely negotiated prices before they could sell to the host utility only Similarly we support any other initiative to give a nondiscriminatory treatment to new generation which should be free to trade energy at freely negotiated basis We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand reduction during rationing To avoid Californias mistakes we will advocate that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices We will advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay of correct economic signals MAE spot prices for those exceding their quotas We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource nor it is effective for a longterm energy rationing as opposed to California where the issue was peak shaving Furthermore as recently pointed out by CERA rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant departure from markets and will open new avenues for market intervention and contract breaches We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand elasticity in electricity prices By linking the success of the rationing program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro We acknowledge that the increase in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the medium term While the financial impact of energy rationing has not been quantified for Elektro we also assume the appetite for markets and energy services may create new business opportunities for Enron We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail competition in proposed threshold level of kW We do not accept a commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail market Instead regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent distribution companies to become stranded by sharing this burden among the captive and free market segments California CTC is an example but government should look at best practices We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to competition in the electricity market Informativo Regulatrio We will also advocate for open access in the pipelines We will express our contrary views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobrs role as the sole gas supplier in order to avoid effective competition in the natural gas We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to the government able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term We will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory risks faced by generators and distributors We will express our views on how to create a healthy contracting environment to foster competition and expand capacity We will oppose any measures which create a nonlevel playing field both at the production or consumption side If emergency actions are needed they should be used on a temporary basis only eg Petrobrs being the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge Finally we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to or at least try to get the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry We acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and that the competitive model has not worked We will express our opposite views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead We acknowlege that it will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse partiesinterests COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process Given that we should express our coherent market based views to the Government We will use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude strengthens our points of view In case conflicts emerge we will preserve the coherence of our ideas as a whole LM
<7278937.1075852032199.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-18 14:01:00,Facing difficultiesAs you know the energy sector is facing several challenges MAE intervention rationing drafting a new market agreement and the like It is all happening as we speak In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders I have defended correct economic signals have a functioning MAE keeping market rules stable creating wholesale and retail competition honoring contract sanctity and the like More importantly that rationing should not be an excuse for revoking supply and demand Those are not ideologic positions only They represent in my view the best interest for Enron in the short medium and long terms We have already agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee That means I am in fact wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enrons best interests Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest among many others a By defending contract sanctity we defended Elektros contractual position on Annex V which sets a formula on how financial contracts decline during rationing Simulations have indicated that our long position even during the deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues On the contraty wo Annex V loss of EBITDA may be US million in b By defending the integrity of MAE spot prices and the like we are paving the road for Eletrobolts success Needless to say Abraceel message has been consistent across the board For example if one believes on markets we have to defend the use of market signals economic incentivespenalties during rationing And prices to allocate a scarce resource Also as a corollary no intervention in spot prices which will in turn make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible I feel very comfortable in defending Enrons interests and wearing my Abraceel hat There is a positive synergy However Orlando is the President of ABRADEE the Brazilian Association of Distributors The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free market seldom are nor they are the interests of Enron For example ABRADEE as a group criticizes the government for changing MAE governance they wanted rolling blackouts instead of economic signals they advocate caps on spot and the like Needless to say there is a potential crash here with some internal reverberations Today the government announced the rationing plan It is based on quotas with an overlay of economic signals tied to wholesale prices This is consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on However ABRADEE wanted rolling blackouts paving the road for eliminating MAE rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures Guess what happened Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the plan and kill it I am convinced that the government made the right decision and we helped influence it The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV radio and other media Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces Last Tuesday I was invited to express our views to the Minister of the Rationing and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is elasticity in demand MAE should work asap intervention was necessary government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot etc Most of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very same meeting The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements of market forces It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days ago where market signals were completely neglected CERA has recently referred to it as a step away from market forces And it was indeed Internally we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron However the situation is getting more complicated as tension increases Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business In sum there is an internal issue going on I do not want to be a trouble maker However I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make things work or at least to try to Our relationship with ANEEL and with the powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent I feel we should take advantage of it and put a stick on the ground That is our culture I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere beside we know that we do not want markets That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last two years with no material results We have remained silent in key issues waiting for this consensus to happen This has been the case for the market intervention The market is misinterpreting our views For example there was a press article today stating that Enron together with AES were dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime stakeholder board What a gross misinterpretation of our views Informativo Regulatorio has conveyed the opposite message and it has inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess They gave us the credit We are still silent on our view waiting for consensus to happen May be I am in too much of a hurry because I am leaving soon But I feel that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen or at least knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon And we are not taking advantage of it I am not expecting any immediate action from you Just for you to be aware on what is going on and share some concerns If you have any comments or any advise please let me know I have even considered to resign Abraceel leadership to avoid future internal conflicts Luiz Maurer

intervention in the MAE This note is organized in four main sections a What was it b Initial reactions c Enrons view d Next steps a WHAT WAS IT Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE It has also amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial settlement In terms of structure ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its responsibilities ASMAE is the organization in charge of developing MAEs basic operational functions such as metering contract registering spot price calculation and financial settlement It also has a role in developing the MAE rules an effort which started in November and has not yet come to fruition ASMAE formerly reported to COEX the MAE Board of Directors According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors In terms of governance ANEEL has terminated COEX a stakeholder Board in charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules The Resolution was effective immediately In lieu of COEX ANEEL has created COMAE a new member professional Board in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE rules on an ongoing basis COMAE should be operational in two months ANEELDistributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each Similarly to COEX COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly where all stakeholdershave a seat votes are equally split between generators and distributors In terms of MAE rules ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees Those were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning but they have never been implemented The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature the ones strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running There is a day period to put the new organization and governance in place In the meantime ASMAE will continue its routine functions If doubts arise ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL b INITIAL REACTIONS Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions The Resolutions were issued on a Friday late afternoon to allow agents to dissipate their anger over the weekend The measures were considered a unilateral coupdeetat kind of intervention A lot of criticism was raised on the legality of the process Initial reactions challenged ANEELs ability to intervene in the MAE rules and terminate COEX Similar reactions were expressed the following week A COEX meeting void in legal terms was held the following week to verbalize peoples angers and discuss next steps An immediate General Assembly was scheduled Several COEX members got really upset Reasons vary some are questioning the necessity of those actions although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic body Some COEX member got very emotional afterall their hierarchical positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted by being a COEX member ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX whose members are motivated by more parochial views The meeting was useful and most of the negative reaction was placated No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL Most stakeholders agree that something had to be done despite the fact that the way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity The issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement containing the basic mandates and addressing utilitys concerns c Enrons view Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed Enron has publicly and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE implementation In Informativo Regulatrio issued back in November we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems Nothing was being decided COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than two years without success No one except a few including Enron was interested in getting MAE up and running Rather most agents were interested in conforming the MAE rules to meet their adhoc individual parochial interests The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear nave retreat to objectives Procrastination was the rule of the game In sum COEX was not working The California experience served to surface and enlighten the maladies of stakeholders Board In several instances we proposed a professional Board and some form of ANEELs intervention as it had the ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market R ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account Regulatory Affairs is proud to have influenced this process However we think ANEEL should have acted a long time ago ANEEL now has a sense of urgency It fully understands that a nonfunctioning market would be an obstacle to anyones building new short term generation on a merchant basis This incremental generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a coupdeetat Legally speaking it is also questionable ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy and by other Federally owned generations who have many votes in the MAE Despite those deficiencies we believe the changes are in the right direction ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our individual support as well as to use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of ABRADEE APINE CBIEE and ABRACEEL to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market Agreement in place Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is The only way to proceed is to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE Agreement to be signed by all parties This would require ANEEL some willingness to negotiate and compromise They accepted our suggestion We have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the MAE rules spot pricing and contracts Our support is contingent on the integrity of market and contracts even during a serious rationing The impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to further interfere set caps on spot and the like We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and proposing changes improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement There are many aspects which need to be clarifiedimproved in the new governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL For example the hierarchical lines between ANEEL COMAE ANEEL General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need clarification Similarly the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to be implemented We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry players asking for inputs and feedback No one is really focused on the new MAE Agreement Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time However we feel that some progress has been made Coalition groups are not talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds This is unlikely to happen on an individual basis The situation is relatively under control d Next Steps Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger there is still a long way to go Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions distributed to industry players should be technically discussed and agreed COMAE members should be appointed ideally utilities should agree on the COMAE members specs on a slate of candidates and on a process for final COMAE members selection Finally a new MAE Agreement should be signed None of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint ANEEL has established a day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens ANEEL itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they are We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats one or two to be appointed by traders So far this group has not been represented in the COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups We feel traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale compatition Collectively they avoid competition and therefore the implementation of the market Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate competition on a genuine basis All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months

confident to express our Enrons views Those letters are just the tip of the iceberg though Another good subject for us to follow up closely is the Bill of Law It proposes several changes to the electric sector Inter alia there is a proposal to keep bulk energy prices regulated after when the initial contracts start expiring This is detrimental to Enron as it t will delay the implementation of a real wholesale market Keeping most of the energy regulated will certainly have spillover effects on the unregulated business We have already discussed this subject internally We all agree that this proposal is bad for Enron However it may be good for Abradee as the distribution companies will be the only buyers of the cheap regulated energy after Needless to say they will likely support it Some of our collegues are anxious and screaming that Enron should put a stick on the ground Right before I left I prepared a simple white paper to us to use internally and externally It shows that maintaining energy regulated is bad for competition and for expansion Enron has been silent on this issue If necessary I can get this translated It is really important My concern is that Enron will

least on the surface I do not like it I have the impression that it washes away Elektros initial long position as Elektro as it puts and end to Annex V discussions I would have to see the numbers to check that this solution is equivalent to Annex V for Enron It depends on how one defines rationing losses This solution is perfect for companies like AES who were both short in the generation and in the distribution businesses They win on both sides How are they going to treat Annex V provisions when load curtailment reduces to and Annex V becomes a liability for Elektro What is going to happen with Annex V It may be part of the agreement it is not clear though From an elecric sector perspective this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity Bad for future investments It would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full passthrough OK This had already been achieved It was an MP Law enacted by Minister Parente The only way we were able to get it was to take Aneel to court here comes my point again why not being equally bold regarding Annex V Perhaps AES influence on Abradee What are the terms of final settlement Will they have any provision regarding Annex V By solving the pending issues for the rationing losses thus eliminating the Annex controversy the MAE should function normally allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool Three comments Technically not correct MAE recently stopped because of a legal injunction of Itaipu energy It is key to have a functioning MAE for Eletrobolt Why has Abradee voted in favor or procrastinating MAE operation three times in the recent past and Enron has not exercised a dissenting vote Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the

are realised Funding scheduled by December th Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R million or US million Corrected numbers in second email AprilMay MAE settlement Market will settle under current rules due to prerationing conditions confirming the procedures used on Elektros books Impact of approximately R million or US million Parcel A for the future All noncontrolable costs to which LDCs are subjected to including power purchases sector charges are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with the LDC tariff revision date Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector Elektro Ebitda impact forward of R million or US million as had been considered in the plan This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in Parcel A from the past Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable that were not passed through to tariffs since late using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney Generals office targeting a final solution in ten days Elektro impact is R million or US million in The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the months for the rationing losses We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector These agreements represent a major step forward significantly improving the value

<17272008.1075862223325.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-11-14 09:33:54,ESA negotiations Good NewsRick I took a quick look at the numbers for rationing and what has been achieved Orlandos statement that the impact on EBITDA was US million is very misleading For a simple reason that we are exchanging a U million credit Annex V for a LOAN Obviously on an EBITDA basis it may look terrific this metrics does not take into consideration the payment of the loan It assumes that the loan is free Lets for a second give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the loan is indeed free because it would be repaid with tariff increases over next months which would not be granted otherwise In that case the credit becomes the loan I only have the overall figure but I assume that Elektros share will be around US million If that is the case the result of the negotiation resulted in a U million reduction by excusing Annex V If one assumes that the tariff increases would happen anyway the loss is US minus the benefit of a subsidized loan If the latter is U million interest and discount rate the loss would be US million US million To summarize Orlando states that negotiations on rationing losses resulted on a benefit of U million I challenge that excusing Annex V has costed us something between US to million I am not sure what we should do with those numbers I am not naive to think that Annex V would be a piece of cake either I just want to note that the good news is not indeed good news Enron will lose money by foregiving Annex V If that is a conscious decision made by Enron Corp that is fine for me But it has to be a well informed decision LM PS As you know press news are not reliable at all but there was a news today saying that generators will be gaining up twice Original Message From Maurer Luiz Sent Tuesday November PM To Shapiro Richard Subject RE ESA government negotiations corrected My initial reaction Rationing Losses I was afraid of this outcome At least on the surface I do not like it I have the impression that it washes away Elektros initial long position as Elektro as it puts and end to Annex V discussions I would have to see the numbers to check that this solution is equivalent to Annex V for Enron It depends on how one defines rationing losses This solution is perfect for companies like AES who were both short in the generation and in the distribution businesses They win on both sides How are they going to treat Annex V provisions when load curtailment reduces to and Annex V becomes a liability for Elektro What is going to happen with Annex V It may be part of the agreement it is not clear though From an elecric sector perspective this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity Bad for future investments It would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full passthrough OK This had already been achieved It was an MP Law enacted by Minister Parente The only way we were able to get it was to take Aneel to court here comes my point again why not being equally bold regarding Annex V Perhaps AES influence on Abradee What are the terms of final settlement Will they have any provision regarding Annex V By solving the pending issues for the rationing losses thus eliminating the Annex controversy the MAE should function normally allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool Three comments Technically not correct MAE recently stopped because of a legal injunction of Itaipu energy It is key to have a functioning MAE for Eletrobolt Why has Abradee voted in favor or procrastinating MAE operation three times in the recent past and Enron has not exercised a dissenting vote Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes I would rather not comment on this statement Original Message From Shapiro Richard Sent

Stanley Shapiro Richard Mark E NRON Cc Assad Sergio Wiggs Brett Soares Britaldo Novak John Subject ESA government negotiations corrected Disegard previous email We reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night The main points are Rationing losses Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next months of rationing losses realised from June until the end of rationing in Recovery includes financial compensation Immediate funding of through BNDES with Brazilian government funds Loans liquidated over the year period as tariff increases are realised Funding scheduled by December th Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R million or US million Corrected numbers in second email AprilMay MAE settlement Market will settle under current rules due to prerationing conditions confirming the procedures used on Elektros books Impact of approximately R million or US million Parcel A for the future All noncontrolable costs to which LDCs are subjected to including power purchases sector charges are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with the LDC tariff revision date Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector Elektro Ebitda impact forward of R million or US million as had been considered in the plan This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in Parcel A from the past Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable that were not passed through to tariffs since late using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney Generals office targeting a final solution in ten days Elektro impact is R million or US million in The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the months for the rationing losses We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector These agreements represent a major step forward significantly improving the value of our businesses By solving the pending issues for the rationing losses thus eliminating the Annex controversy the MAE should function normally allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool Total amounts for the sector represent about R billion or US billion at the current rates Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing and have been instrumental in

to us I think we should not be afraid of putting a stick on the ground as necessary I know that Mario Arce got upset with me and I did not mean it However he has to know that if he comes up with some precooked crazy ideas Kill Annex V caps on spot he will have to face the discipline of the media He or any other has to know that we will do whatever is necessary to get our ideas across It is a war

Seminar promoted by ABCE The first topic presented by ABCEs President by the opening of the S eminar was the importance of the maintenance of the Annex V of the Initial Contracts Among other matters it was discussed during the event the C oncession Contract and Rationing Prof Caio Tcito one of the most well known and respected scholars was one of the speakers According with him the losses in sales and revenues that the DCs will suffer as a result of the cut of the load may be recovered by DCs based on the principle of th e reestablishment of the economicfinancial balancing equilibrium of the concession agreement Prof Tcito further emphasized his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa sum that is to be collected should be reserv ed in favor of the DCs so as to compensate partially such losses Finall y Mr Tcito suggested that in order to avoid legal controversies the Go vernment could alternatively conceive using the surcharge sobretarifa collected as future credits to be used by consumers when rationing is ov erDavid Watenberg also ratified such understanding He further expressed his belief that the surcharge sobretarifa has no legal grounds to sur vive This is so because

of those institutions Finally this could also serve as a basis for our internal and external communication plans Overall Guiding Principles As an overrarching objective for Enron all over the world we defend inter alia markets competition both at retail and wholesale levels contract sanctity free prices and customer choice We will balance our short term and long term interests to maximize company shareholders value We will focus our advocacy efforts on issues which have more impact on shareholders value we will constantly talk to our multiple internal users to understand their needs and how those can be translated in terms of regulatory support We will use several coalition groups to defend our interests We will select the coalition groups more aligned with our own interests In case Enrons interests conflict with the interests of the coalitions we are part of we will defend and express our interests individually we will let our coalition groups know when our interest conflict with the general view on a particular subject and that we will express our views separately As a consequence of the above the first step is to have our own view If we do not know what the right way is any alternative may look equally good or bad Commandment list Issues Related to the Current Situation of the Energy Sector in Brazil We want the Wholesale Energy Market MAE to operate effectively asap We acknowledge that COEX the stakeholder board has not worked properly over the last years The consensus building process and the nature of the zero sum game issues have prevented COEX to be effective We advocate professional independent boards instead as we do in most markets we participate worldwide Informativo Regulatrio represent our best view on the subject for Brazil Therefore we applaud ANEEL in its recent initiatives to fix inter alia i the ineffectiveness of COEX by replacing it by COMAE a professional board ii introducing penalties and guarantees for financial settlement COEX was not able to introduce any in the last two years which has resulted in a US million default iii we acknowledge that the Ordinances published by ANEEL to fix the market are legally weak and may be challenged iv therefore we should help ANEEL in drafting a new Market Agreement to enhance the governance of the new board make MAE the organizational structure more effective and introduce penalties and guarantees which do not overpenalize our long positions loss sharing v we will do our best to convince our peers about the proposed changes however if the agreed level is too superficial to be useful in drafting the new MAE agreement we will present our view to ANEEL separately vi we will advocate that companies trading in the free market should have a nondiscriminatory treatment within MAE and COMAE vii we will strive to have e seat at COMAE appointed by the free trading association We will advocate free market prices and no caps on the wholesale spot price even during rationing in fact already capped at about R MWh which represents the embedded cost of deficit This conceptual view is perfectly consistent with our expected Elektro Eletrobolt and wholesale position all of them long We will strongly oppose any government temptation to set additional caps on spot prices On the contrary we will support any initiative to review the current cost of deficit which we believe to be underestimated We have recently supported as strongly suggested by our trading group ANEELs proposal to significantly raise the cost of deficit particularly during rationing We advocate that any caps on spot prices create disencentives to capacity expansion and therefore will aggravate the rationing crisis We defend Contract sanctity In this regard we will fight with Aneel to have the passthrough of noncontrollable costs for Elektro such as power purchases costs Aneel has given its own interpretation to the concession contract whereby any cost increase occurring between two successive tariff reviews should not be recovered We defend the idea of a tracking account or a similar mechanism We will take the necessary measures against ANEEL either individually or as part of the distribution coalition group to defend our interests Along the same lines of Contract Sanctity we will defend Annex V which is a contractual provision to scale down Initial Contract volumes upon rationing According to several Elektros analysis developed thus far preserving Annex VI will represent a substantial benefit to Elektro even able to offset the negative impact our foregone revenues during rationing If Annex V is revoked and the reduction of Initial Contracts is calculated on the basis of actual load redution as proposed in the rumor mill we will forego US million in terms of EBITDA We will refuse to negotiate with our suppliers eg Duke AES any changes in the Initial Contracts which entail any transfer of riskcosts between generators and distributors We will also express our protest to any Brazilian Government authorities tempted to change the Annex V under the assumption that contract sanctity is being violated and that this creates additional regulatory uncertainty We will also claim that revoking Annex V will jeopardize the success of the rationing plan because of the free ride effect We will not advocate any bailout of companies negatively affected by Annex V because they poorly evaluated the impact of Annex V when companies were privatized We will argue that Annex V was designed specifically to deal with rationing situations and therefore there is not any excuse to change the rules now We will not agree to set additional caps on spot not even the proposal to maintaing it as it is which will represent about US million to Elektro Caps are actually a disguised way of partially revoking Annex V We will support Aneels Resolution recently published whereby any new generation backup self generator no matter its size is allowed to sell to any market player at freely negotiated prices before they could sell to the host utility only Similarly we support any other initiative to give a nondiscriminatory treatment to new generation which should be free to trade energy at freely negotiated basis We will support the use of correct economic signals to foster demand reduction during rationing To avoid Californias mistakes we will advocate that the correct signals should link the wholesale and retail prices We will advocate the government to establish a quota system and establish an overlay of correct economic signals MAE spot prices for those exceding their quotas We will oppose rolling blackouts on the grounds that it does not provide the best economic allocation of a scarce resource nor it is effective for a longterm energy rationing as opposed to California where the issue was peak shaving Furthermore as recently pointed out by CERA rolling black outs as initially proposed in Brazil are a significant departure from markets and will open new avenues for market intervention and contract breaches We will rebuff those who argue that there is no demand elasticity in electricity prices By linking the success of the rationing program to free movements to the MAE price we are protecting our long positions both at Eletrobolt and at Elektro We acknowledge that the increase in electricity prices may create a taste for energy rationing measures in the medium term While the financial impact of energy rationing has not been quantified for Elektro we also assume the appetite for markets and energy services may create new business opportunities for Enron We will support ANEEL in its attempts to open the market to retail competition in proposed threshold level of kW We do not accept a commonly accepted argument that minimum contracting requirements for distribution companies are inconsistent with the opening of the retail market Instead regulatory safeguards should be put in place to prevent distribution companies to become stranded by sharing this burden among the captive and free market segments California CTC is an example but government should look at best practices We will advocate for competition at the natural gas as a key ingredient to competition in the electricity market Informativo Regulatrio We will also advocate for open access in the pipelines We will express our contrary views against any discriminatory measure trying to protect Petrobrs role as the sole gas supplier in order to avoid effective competition in the natural gas We will leverage our best expertise to propose a solid capacity plan to the government able to alleviate the energy crisis in the medium term We will talk about the necessary actions to be taken to eliminate regulatory risks faced by generators and distributors We will express our views on how to create a healthy contracting environment to foster competition and expand capacity We will oppose any measures which create a nonlevel playing field both at the production or consumption side If emergency actions are needed they should be used on a temporary basis only eg Petrobrs being the sole provider of gas molecules and FX hedge Finally we should take advantage of the current window of opportunities and all the power granted to the Ministry of Rationing to or at least try to get the energy sector fixed toward a more competitive industry We acknowledge that the crisis will be used as a scapegoat why privatization and that the competitive model has not worked We will express our opposite views and we will propose pragmatic measures instead We acknowlege that it will be very difficult to reach consensus among so diverse partiesinterests COEX is a typical example on how the endless search for consensus was tantamount to lack of efficiency of the overall process Given that we should express our coherent market based views to the Government We will use our coalition groups on a selective basis whenever this attitude strengthens our points of view In case conflicts emerge we will preserve the coherence of our ideas as a whole LM

<3264963.1075844271121.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,luiz.maurer@enron.com,2001-05-18 14:01:00,Facing difficultiesAs you know the energy sector is facing several challenges MAE intervention rationing drafting a new market agreement and the like It is all happening as we speak In my capacity of President of the Brazilian Association of Energy Traders I have defended correct economic signals have a functioning MAE keeping market rules stable creating wholesale and retail competition honoring contract sanctity and the like More importantly that rationing should not be an excuse for revoking supply and demand Those are not ideologic positions only They represent in my view the best interest for Enron in the short medium and long terms We have already agreed on that in a recent Enron executive commitee That means I am in fact wearing Abraceel hat to defend Enrons best interests Just two examples on how those principles are linked to our interest among many others a By defending contract sanctity we defended Elektros contractual position on Annex V which sets a formula on how financial contracts decline during rationing Simulations have indicated that our long position even during the deepest rationing will offset loss of revenues On the contraty wo Annex V loss of EBITDA may be US million in b By defending the integrity of MAE spot prices and the like we are paving the road for Eletrobolts success Needless to say Abraceel message has been consistent across the board For example if one believes on markets we have to defend the use of market signals economic incentivespenalties during rationing And prices to allocate a scarce resource Also as a corollary no intervention in spot prices which will in turn make our Eletrobolt merchant plant feasible I feel very comfortable in defending Enrons interests and wearing my Abraceel hat There is a positive synergy However Orlando is the President of ABRADEE the Brazilian Association of Distributors The interests of ABRADEE are not always the interests of free market seldom are nor they are the interests of Enron For example ABRADEE as a group criticizes the government for changing MAE governance they wanted rolling blackouts instead of economic signals they advocate caps on spot and the like Needless to say there is a potential crash here with some internal reverberations Today the government announced the rationing plan It is based on quotas with an overlay of economic signals tied to wholesale prices This is consistent with markets and what ABRACEEL has been saying on and on However ABRADEE wanted rolling blackouts paving the road for eliminating MAE rules and setting caps on spot to avoid exposures Guess what happened Orlando is being pressured by his peers to criticize the plan and kill it I am convinced that the government made the right decision and we helped influence it The subject has received a lot of press coverage on TV radio and other media Abraceel has been viewed as one of the champions of market forces Last Tuesday I was invited to express our views to the Minister of the Rationing and I think I was quite persuasive in showing that there is elasticity in demand MAE should work asap intervention was necessary government should refrain from the temptation to set caps on spot etc Most of those statements where contrary to what Abradee had stated in the very same meeting The plan the Government announced today embeds several elements of market forces It was a sudden shift from the plan announced a few days ago where market signals were completely neglected CERA has recently referred to it as a step away from market forces And it was indeed Internally we have been managing this tension in a productive way for Enron However the situation is getting more complicated as tension increases Orlando is getting a little uncomfortable because his peers perceive Luiz Maurer as someone against the interest of the distribution business In sum there is an internal issue going on I do not want to be a trouble maker However I feel that we have now a window of opportunities to make things work or at least to try to Our relationship with ANEEL and with the powerful Ministry of Rationing has been excellent I feel we should take advantage of it and put a stick on the ground That is our culture I think that spending too much time and energy in building consensus among different stakeholders is not going to lead us anywhere beside we know that we do not want markets That is what we have been doing at COEX in the last two years with no material results We have remained silent in key issues waiting for this consensus to happen This has been the case for the market intervention The market is misinterpreting our views For example there was a press article today stating that Enron together with AES were dominating COEX and are trying to revert the situation back to the old regime stakeholder board What a gross misinterpretation of our views Informativo Regulatorio has conveyed the opposite message and it has inspired ANEEL to start fixing the mess They gave us the credit We are still silent on our view waiting for consensus to happen May be I am in too much of a hurry because I am leaving soon But I feel that we have a window of opportunity to make things happen or at least knowing that they are not going to happen any time soon And we are not taking advantage of it I am not expecting any immediate action from you Just for you to be aware on what is going on and share some concerns If you have any comments or any advise please let me know I have even considered to resign Abraceel leadership to avoid future internal conflicts Luiz Maurer

intervention in the MAE This note is organized in four main sections a What was it b Initial reactions c Enrons view d Next steps a WHAT WAS IT Aneel has recently issued a series of three Resolutions significantly changing the structure and governance of MAE It has also amended some of the MAE rules regarding penalties and guarantees on financial settlement In terms of structure ANEEL has empowered ASMAE to develop its responsibilities ASMAE is the organization in charge of developing MAEs basic operational functions such as metering contract registering spot price calculation and financial settlement It also has a role in developing the MAE rules an effort which started in November and has not yet come to fruition ASMAE formerly reported to COEX the MAE Board of Directors According to the recently enacted Resolution ASMAE will have now a solid line relationship with ANEEL and it was empowered to develop it basic organizational functions more independently from the Board of Directors In terms of governance ANEEL has terminated COEX a stakeholder Board in charge or runinng MAE and preparing the MAE rules The Resolution was effective immediately In lieu of COEX ANEEL has created COMAE a new member professional Board in charge of overseeing ASMAE and developing MAE rules on an ongoing basis COMAE should be operational in two months ANEELDistributors and Generators should appoint two voting members each Similarly to COEX COMAE will still report to the MAE General Assembly where all stakeholdershave a seat votes are equally split between generators and distributors In terms of MAE rules ANEEL has now imposed penalties and guarantees Those were part of the MAE rules since the very beginning but they have never been implemented The original MAE rules encompassed a broader range of penalties ANEEL has focused solely on the the penalties of financial nature the ones strictly necessary to have the financial settlement up and running There is a day period to put the new organization and governance in place In the meantime ASMAE will continue its routine functions If doubts arise ASMAE will clarify directly with ANEEL b INITIAL REACTIONS Most companies were shocked with the new Resolutions The Resolutions were issued on a Friday late afternoon to allow agents to dissipate their anger over the weekend The measures were considered a unilateral coupdeetat kind of intervention A lot of criticism was raised on the legality of the process Initial reactions challenged ANEELs ability to intervene in the MAE rules and terminate COEX Similar reactions were expressed the following week A COEX meeting void in legal terms was held the following week to verbalize peoples angers and discuss next steps An immediate General Assembly was scheduled Several COEX members got really upset Reasons vary some are questioning the necessity of those actions although most agree that COEX was not a functioning organic body Some COEX member got very emotional afterall their hierarchical positions inside their organizations depend on the status granted by being a COEX member ANEEL invited CEOs from all affiliated companies to explain the rationale behind those measures and avoid direct confrontation with COEX whose members are motivated by more parochial views The meeting was useful and most of the negative reaction was placated No one is now is now considering any legal action against ANEEL Most stakeholders agree that something had to be done despite the fact that the way ANEEL invervened was disastrous and with doubtful legal validity The issue now is to prepare a new Market Agreement containing the basic mandates and addressing utilitys concerns c Enrons view Enron thinks that the proposed changes were badly needed Enron has publicly and in several occasions expressed its view about COEX role in MAE implementation In Informativo Regulatrio issued back in November we blamed the stakeholder nature of COEX for most of MAE problems Nothing was being decided COEX attempted to get the MAE rules in place for more than two years without success No one except a few including Enron was interested in getting MAE up and running Rather most agents were interested in conforming the MAE rules to meet their adhoc individual parochial interests The COEX attempt to deal with the nuclear issue was a clear nave retreat to objectives Procrastination was the rule of the game In sum COEX was not working The California experience served to surface and enlighten the maladies of stakeholders Board In several instances we proposed a professional Board and some form of ANEELs intervention as it had the ultimate responsibility to have a functioning market R ANEEL has reportedly taking our comments into account Regulatory Affairs is proud to have influenced this process However we think ANEEL should have acted a long time ago ANEEL now has a sense of urgency It fully understands that a nonfunctioning market would be an obstacle to anyones building new short term generation on a merchant basis This incremental generation is key to mitigate the impact of rationing No one doubts that ANEELs intervention was a coupdeetat Legally speaking it is also questionable ANEEL is backed by the Ministry of Energy and by other Federally owned generations who have many votes in the MAE Despite those deficiencies we believe the changes are in the right direction ANEEL has called Enron and asked for our individual support as well as to use our influence in the coalitions groups we are part of ABRADEE APINE CBIEE and ABRACEEL to help mitigate the anger and help get the new Market Agreement in place Apparently ANEEL did not call any other private utility We explained ANEEL how delicate the situation is The only way to proceed is to shift the spotlight from the legal issues and try to focus on a new MAE Agreement to be signed by all parties This would require ANEEL some willingness to negotiate and compromise They accepted our suggestion We have also expressed our view that ANEEL should not further interfere in the MAE rules spot pricing and contracts Our support is contingent on the integrity of market and contracts even during a serious rationing The impending rationing indeed represents a temptation for the regulator to further interfere set caps on spot and the like We have focused most of our effort in examining the three Resolutions and proposing changes improvements to be incorporated into a new MAE Agreement There are many aspects which need to be clarifiedimproved in the new governance and structure as proposed by ANEEL For example the hierarchical lines between ANEEL COMAE ANEEL General Assembly and Board of ASMAE need clarification Similarly the penalty rules need a lot of work to be ready to be implemented We have prepared several suggestions and we have circulated among industry players asking for inputs and feedback No one is really focused on the new MAE Agreement Discussions are still very emotional at this point in time However we feel that some progress has been made Coalition groups are not talking about challenging the Resolution on legal grounds This is unlikely to happen on an individual basis The situation is relatively under control d Next Steps Despite the progress in mitigating the initial anger there is still a long way to go Our initial recommendations to improve the Resolutions distributed to industry players should be technically discussed and agreed COMAE members should be appointed ideally utilities should agree on the COMAE members specs on a slate of candidates and on a process for final COMAE members selection Finally a new MAE Agreement should be signed None of them are trivial tasks from a political standpoint ANEEL has established a day transitional period and a safety net if nothing happens ANEEL itself would choose the members and will maintain the Resolutions as they are We are also going to use ABRACEEL to lobby for COMAE seats one or two to be appointed by traders So far this group has not been represented in the COEX and in any other MAE formal or informal discussion groups We feel traders are handicaped and that this is detrimental to the market as a whole Distributors avoid retail competition while generators avoid wholesale compatition Collectively they avoid competition and therefore the implementation of the market Traders are the only ones who strongly advocate competition on a genuine basis All of this will keep Regulatory Affairs busy for the next months

Subject ASMAE taking the wrong view on Annex X Ignorance or bad faith Last Friday Patricia Arce Mario Arces daughter and a full time ASMAE employee was expressing her distorted views to the press on why generating companies should not abide by Annex V She was not speaking on behalf of ASMAE however she was probably reflecting ASMAE view I did not mean to shoot the messenger but I could not refrain myself from expressing an opposite opinion There are two problems in Patricias view She is not supposed to express any views on contracts MAE should only settle contracts but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract disputes The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAEs frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II Furnas conflict in the last months Informativo Regulatrio explores the issue in more detail She was dead wrong Quite nave arguments A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V we may use externally as you see fit Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts So what It is a regulated contract by nature as so many others such as CUST CUSD CCT CCD Does it mean that parties signing those other agreements should not abide by their clauses Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions So what I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement without any chance to negotiate its terms it is by definition an adhesion contract Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement provisions Guess what the answer was None Some Gs did not sign Annex V eg Furnas which apparently disobeyed Annels instructions as per Law This is serious That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract those Gs do not want to abide by Law No response Some companies do not have Annex V So what Discussion is about Annex V Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts Ttariff energy price was not subject to negotiation as part of the Initial Contracts therefore they were not able to price the risk represented by Annex V So what Many contracts have regulated prices All use of system contracts have regulated prices Furthermore the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V risk Why giving them a windfall now Since it is a zero sum game a windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing it was designed to mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch Wrong ERM Mecanismo de Realocao de Energia was the mechanism put in place to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool operation Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing It is called dry period relief clause It was proposed by the generators and approved by Annel The spot price is a proxy for the depth of rationing One should not evoke rationing I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is bullet proof In the meantime let me share my views There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on the ridiculous proposal made by generators that merchant plants should collect part in cash and part of their sales in junk bonds We should make this clear at the outset We should make Minister Patente realize that Mario Arces proposal is nonsense Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices is a bad precedent No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known risks A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and FonteCindam and became a public scandal If we do want to create a market we need to have responsible contracting Irresponsible contracting should not be forgiven If we do it we will create a bad precedent and a poor environment for contracting We have to show Minister Parente that irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates no caps on spot Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity Breaching contracts will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs Crisis will get worse and worse Generators should have the burden of proof In the meantime Annex V is effective and should be enforceable Regarding California case as mentioned by Mario Arce It is a totally different situation In California DCs were not allowed to contract In Brazil they were strongly encouraged Generators who signed Annex V could also have hedged their residual risks on Annex VThey did not They acted irresponsibly They secondguessed regulations They did not help in expanding capacity They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex V The argument no one should lose no one should gain during rationing is inconsistent with market signals Some one has to lose some one has to gain by definition And hopefully someone has to go bankrupt This will be a great lesson People will start taking market signals more seriously Otherwise there will never be expansion and there will never be a market We have to be as transparent as possible Finally I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week I volunteer to prepare a first draft if you guys agree it is a good idea LM

multitiered and that even the first tier should be higher I also wouldnt concede that changing the cost of defecit is a change of the rules Nevertheless leaving it where it is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political pressures I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE eg there is no substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price signals credit integrity and timely cash settlement I WOULD NOT make the resolution of Angra II a precondition for the continuing wellbeing of the MAE Lets just get the market working

required Cheers Paul Original Message From Dawson Paul Sent November To Maurer Luiz Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Stroup Kerry Subject RE Draft Questions to Ashley Brown The state of transmissiontransportation regulation here is continually evolving and a full treatment would qualify for an economics doctorate You should also be aware that not everything out of Ofgem the UK regulator makes sense Hence while Ive provided some answers to your specific questions below I would see these only as broad guides to the issues you are facing in the US and would retain a healthy degree of scepticism about the lessons to be drawn from UK schemes In particular I would caution against relying solely on the NGC incentives document since this is only a small part of a much large jigsaw of price controls etc Do you think that the UK forprofit Transco model has been working satisfactorily We know it is still early for you to make a final judgement but have the incentives and penalties shaped the way NG behaves in terms of costs and elimination of T contraints The forprofit model has worked reasonably well so far Both RPIX regulation and NGCTranscos incentive schemes have driven out many operating costs However the link into ensuring longterm investment is not clear RPIX in its purest form has poor investment incentives Ofgem are seeking to remedy this by introducing longerterm contracts for transmission capacity together with upside rates of return if the companies improve on some key output measures they are leading the way on this in gas Nevertheless I think theyre still some way short of solving the problem In my view this is because the problem borders on the insoluble Ofgem are obsessed with introducing market based signals for new investment Im deeply sceptical about this while you can auction fixed amounts of capacity and thereby get a market price the capacity made available at one location depends on the amount made available at all other locations In short there are major network externalities which are the source of the natural monopoly in transmission As a result the regulator andor the Transco will always need to define how much capacity should be built and made available at particular locations In turn this means that while contracts can play some role we cant leave regulation behind in ensuring that sufficient network capacity is made availalble As far as the forprofit and nonprofit debate goes Im an agnostic The former can undoubtedly focus the mind NGC have virtually removed voltage constraint from the system due to installation of reactive compensation equipment but serious doubts still remain about the ability of the UK system to implement major new investment On the flip side I would be concerned about how to ensure appropriate performance incentives for nonproift transmission organisation We took a good look a the NGC system operator price control and incentive schemes under NETA Final Proposal Dated December attached Which of the alternative proposals on page has been adopted The final proposals are here docsngcmodmarchpdf These might be useful if youre having trouble sleeping but I suspect that the finer details of NGCs scheme are too casespecific to be of any use elsewhere The key element I think is the fact that Ofgem gave NGC a choice from several different incentive schemes This mirrors some economic theory developed by Laffont and Tirole on the design of optimal incentive sctructures The idea is to overcome the information assymmetry between the regulator and company because the company reveals the optimal structure in choosing between the alternatives Have the incentivespenalties system been working or have them been subject to reviews in terms of targes upsides collars and other parameters due to external factors beyond Transco control The incentive schemes are subject to regular review but for the reasons above Im not sure you can draw any lessons beyond the general lesson that incentive schemes can be useful ways of making efficiency gains Im not aware of any scheme being reopened because of external factors Could you send us or help us find the official Transmission Licence Agreement where all incentives and penalties are clearly spelled out As above but again how relevant are these specifics for your purposes Question related to NETA rules As I understood there is not a central pool and market participants generators and suppliers have to submit a balanced schedule in the forward market NG is responsible for small imbalances or residual purchasing If that is true how can NG be made accountable for energy deviations in the real time that it has no control whatsoever It seems that the incentive mechamism takes this metrics into account NGC accepts offers for more generation or less demand and bids for less generation and more demand which it calls off to balance the system in real time It doesnt need control because people are free

advocating the former Im yet to be convinced that there are huge differences between physicalfinancial transmission schemes despite noodling on the problem continuously for the last years it all started in CA in At the end of the day someone the system operator must decide what is required where to keep the system stable ie to make spot decisions on transmission availability If the capacity is fungible you would also expect a secondary market to emerge in physical rights It would however be practically quite difficult to introduce an LMP scheme under NETA This is why were moving down the entryexit physical capacity route We prepared a list of questions to be sent to NG Could you please take a look Do they make sense Are they based on correct assumptions regarding the UK system Any

importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implementaion of wholesale markets RTO participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well You included some elements of this topic under the title An Installed capacity requirement is not necessary It does fit under this title but I think it is more than that Perhaps a separate item A few possible additional points a Demand response has been very limited so far because customers have been under a regulatory shield b A few attempts to make load see correct prices have been very encouraging There is still a long way to go though c There has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices eg DSB d Wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways such as i increased chances for the market to clear at all times ii mitigate price spikes and as a consequence the need for caps iii proxy for reserves e It will take some time to get demand response In the meantime some interim measures may be necessary such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments your footnote to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level f Even for this interim period we do not support caps By not having caps the rationale for capacity payment disappears FERC will deal with market power if any on an adhoc basism by not allowing market based rates instead of caps This is the approach MISO has been taking and we agreed with it What about including the text A well designed RTO as an attachment the one recently prepared by Janel Hydro I agree with your point that LMP may work in a hydro based system The only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade In that case plants are not free to bid there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management The marginal price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process but it is the shadow price of an optimization program This very same price could be the basis for the LMP Not a big deal Hydro plants do not like LMP because in general they are far away from consumer centers and LMP with technical losses penalizes them a lot We should stick to our point that LMP should be used across all RTOs Still on LMP on the northwest page second paragraph I agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out For example generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum or maximum requirements However I would not call this allowing bilateral contracts I would call it accomodate must run requirements caused by operational inflexibilities for example if a run of river plant decides to be merchant it still should have the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run Still on LMP for hydro I am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the Northwest RTO Steve Walton to confirm Otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page I think David suggested to use the NY example I am not familiar with Capacity Payment Page last paragraph Finally any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a specitc generator as a physical product I know what you meant but it may lead to dubious interpretations It may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures If we were able to get property rights on reliability issues the capacity fee discussion wouuld be a nobrainer I would eliminate the sentence Capacity Payment Page last paragraph our white paper on capacity footnote does not clearly say that the RTO should the purchasing agent during the interim period It may be the case provider of last resource but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution What we can certainly say is that in the interim period the RTO should be responsible for system adequacy plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all Control Areas as opposed to having each one of them working independently Sorry for
