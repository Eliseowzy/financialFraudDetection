Wednesday August AM To Richter Brad Kitchen Louise Calger Christopher F Cc Webb Jay Taylor Mark E Legal Subject RE eNYMEX Brad We may consider targeting a wide audience Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise MM plus option fees I have two primary documents One is the spec sheet and a general scope The other is a turbine purchase agreement A counterparty can have two options One is to contact us to provide a bid There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract For MM they would have a day call on the turbines during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence The MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period It may be a nuance but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine Is this consistent with EOLs format Steve Original Message From Richter Brad Sent Wednesday August AM To Kitchen Louise Cc Webb Jay Thome Stephen Taylor Mark E Legal Subject RE eNYMEX Armed with a target list of purchasers we can craft the new product popup to hit those companies systems when they log on which would give them the following information General description of the assets Contact information names numbers Directions on refiltering for the Turbine Product which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those preapproved companies The Long Description would essentially be the turbines Spec Sheet But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer we could replace the GTCs with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to days of diligence with a breakup fee if the deal doesnt close If the company isnt willing to commit to that the contact information will be their route to getting more information Thoughts Brad Original Message From Kitchen Louise Sent Tuesday August PM To Richter Brad Cc Webb Jay Thome Stephen Taylor Mark E Legal Subject RE eNYMEX Ahha The turbines idea on EOL I dont want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines exactly the same as any other product They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada You never know someone may click it would be an interesting concept and probably nonbinding as there would be site inspections etc But not an advert actually posting the turbines Louise Original Message From Richter Brad Sent Tuesday August PM To Kitchen Louise Cc Webb Jay Subject RE eNYMEX Bob

popup that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets Im told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the
