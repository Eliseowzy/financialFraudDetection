<27297710.1075845877966.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dtucker@bracepatt.com,2000-09-07 06:42:00,Re Sept Agency Draft Cc to your comments as follows Sect The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net Revenues duplicates part but not all of the first sentence of Section with regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue Perhaps the makeup of Cumulative Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or as an alternative the definition could crossreference Youre absolutely right The and for purposes of Section Section reference is a bust Ive recast the sentence as The calculation of Cumulative Net Revenues is made expressly subject to Sections and I dont believe the language of Sect regarding the makeup of Cumulative Net Revenue is intended to be only for purposes of Section as the wording of suggests I included that to avoid any unintended consequences in the event we later use Cumulative Net Revenue in other contexts for which it wouldnt be appropriate to include such refundrevenues but if you believe its confusing Ill delete the clause Sect I would delete part i if the last sentence It would be illegal and contrary to this Agreement for MEH or Peoples to charge a rate above the maximum so it seems inappropriate to suggest that MEH can collect a fee for doing this Per our discussion I agree that it seems inappropriate to contemplate knowing violations of federal law Ill soften it so it will have a better chance of not raising regulatory hackles Perhaps we should just make Peoples responsible for all refunds Let me know what you think That would be easier but it seems fair that we should be responsible for risks we knowingly or recklessly assume Also lines from the end of I think the reference to ii is a typo I believe its just Its now changed Sect Do we want to include any work related to the Governmental Approval as ordinary course My inclination is to not include it so as to avoid arguments with Peoples over whats extraordinary and whats ordinary in this context As always I thank you for your help DT David A Tucker Bracewell Patterson LLP Pennzoil Place South Tower Louisiana Houston Texas Phone Fax Email
