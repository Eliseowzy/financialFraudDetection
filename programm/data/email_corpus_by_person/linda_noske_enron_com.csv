Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO I would guess that AEC has had a change of heart since they signed the MOU with Southern I would expect them to withdraw their comments I will talk to Jeff Parrish at AEC and find out whats going on I talked to Bob Reilley about the EPSA filing He made it sound like it had just been forgotten in the rush and he didnt seem to have a clear idea about what EPSA should say in a filing Thats funny since he drafted the original document we started talking from Anyway we discussed it again and he agreed to get back to EPSA and discuss a filing The topics would be MOUs dont mean much No real progress has been shown FERC need to oversee the process FERC needs to ensure a collaborative process is implemented I didnt tell Bob that Enron wants to stay out of it but we talked about it being better to have EPSA carry the ball when we first started looking at this I think your bringing it up in the EPSA phone call will help Let me know if it looks like Bob is not following up with EPSA Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron cc Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO Joe I agree with the approach that we should try to get EPSA to file I have spoken with Mark Bennett over at EPSA and he indicated that he hadnt gotten to it Perhaps I should bring it up on the EPSA call this Thursday just a gentle reminder AEC was the

possibility of another paper RTO proposal by December They do ask for a technical conference by FERC staff and then a settlement judge proceeding thereafter Joe Connor AM To James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Donna NRON cc Subject Re Southern RTO I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday They talked about what is going on with the nonjurisdictional utilities that have signed a MOU to develop a RTO The group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use Confidentiality agreements have been signed so no details are available but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development Southern has about one third of the votes and of the assets and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to carry a vote Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that Southern was not going to run or dominate the process After that Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the RTO work and resolve the hurdles the nonjurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other RTOs They said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldnt be sure agreement would be reached but at this point there was a lot of cooperation Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete RTO filing could be ready by They also said they thought this is what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development They said that it was too early to make any commitment but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible They said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different but they pointed out again that Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group In the meantime they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group Jim I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and Steve Kean and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come I dont think they want to discuss anything technical at this point they just want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area and they want any help we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southerns May th status report either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority Donna I guess thats who you meant in the memo below since AEC has signed a MOU with Southern I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we havent heard from EPSA on its filing I still think thats the best approach Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron Tom CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Subject Southern supplemental status report I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its RT on June They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO These are really general more of the same of what weve seen from Southern Also we had talked about possible comments on the May Southern filing Coral was working on comments through EPSA Nothing has been filed by EPSA yet Alabama did file comments on the May status report and they have asked that the FERC establish a technical conference to publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay Following a technical conference they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at FERC to undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time At this point we could consider filing

Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO I would guess that AEC has had a change of heart since they signed the MOU with Southern I would expect them to withdraw their comments I will talk to Jeff Parrish at AEC and find out whats going on I talked to Bob Reilley about the EPSA filing He made it sound like it had just been forgotten in the rush and he didnt seem to have a clear idea about what EPSA should say in a filing Thats funny since he drafted the original document we started talking from Anyway we discussed it again and he agreed to get back to EPSA and discuss a filing The topics would be MOUs dont mean much No real progress has been shown FERC need to oversee the process FERC needs to ensure a collaborative process is implemented I didnt tell Bob that Enron wants to stay out of it but we talked about it being better to have EPSA carry the ball when we first started looking at this I think your bringing it up in the EPSA phone call will help Let me know if it looks like Bob is not following up with EPSA Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron cc Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO Joe I agree with the approach that we should try to get EPSA to file I have spoken with Mark Bennett over at EPSA and he indicated that he hadnt gotten to it Perhaps I should bring it up on the EPSA call this Thursday just a gentle reminder AEC was the culprit who commented on June They were extremely negative about Southerns lack of results in their attempt to increase participation in the RTO They said Southern suggests no more than the possibility of another paper RTO proposal by December They do ask for a technical conference by FERC staff and then a settlement judge proceeding thereafter Joe Connor AM To James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Donna NRON cc Subject Re Southern RTO I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday They talked about what is going on with the nonjurisdictional utilities that have signed a MOU to develop a RTO The group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use Confidentiality agreements have been signed so no details are available but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development Southern has about one third of the votes and of the assets and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to carry a vote Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that Southern was not going to run or dominate the process After that Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the RTO work and resolve the hurdles the nonjurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other RTOs They said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldnt be sure agreement would be reached but at this point there was a lot of cooperation Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete RTO filing could be ready by They also said they thought this is what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development They said that it was too early to make any commitment but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible They said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different but they pointed out again that Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group In the meantime they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group Jim I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and Steve Kean and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come I dont think they want to discuss anything technical at this point they just want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area and they want any help we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southerns May th status report either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority Donna I guess thats who you meant in the memo below since AEC has signed a MOU with Southern I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we havent heard from EPSA on its filing I still think thats the best approach Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron Tom CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Subject Southern supplemental status report I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its RT on June They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO These are really general more of the same of what weve seen from Southern Also we had talked about possible comments on the May Southern filing Coral was working on comments through EPSA Nothing has been filed by EPSA yet Alabama did file comments on the May status report and they have asked that the FERC establish a technical conference to publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay Following a technical conference they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at FERC to undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time At this point we could consider filing

<23282342.1075850603360.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.noske@enron.com,2001-07-05 03:00:00,Re Southern RTOChristi Nicolay Forwarded by Linda J NoskeHOUECT on AM From Joe NRON on PM To Donna NRON cc Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO I would guess that AEC has had a change of heart since they signed the MOU with Southern I would expect them to withdraw their comments I will talk to Jeff Parrish at AEC and find out whats going on I talked to Bob Reilley about the EPSA filing He made it sound like it had just been forgotten in the rush and he didnt seem to have a clear idea about what EPSA should say in a filing Thats funny since he drafted the original document we started talking from Anyway we discussed it again and he agreed to get back to EPSA and discuss a filing The topics would be MOUs dont mean much No real progress has been shown FERC need to oversee the process FERC needs to ensure a collaborative process is implemented I didnt tell Bob that Enron wants to stay out of it but we talked about it being better to have EPSA carry the ball when we first started looking at this I think your bringing it up in the EPSA phone call will help Let me know if it looks like Bob is not following up with EPSA Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron cc Christi L CT James D NRON Sarah NRON Subject Re Southern RTO Joe I agree with the approach that we should try to get EPSA to file I have spoken with Mark Bennett over at EPSA and he indicated that he hadnt gotten to it Perhaps I should bring it up on the EPSA call this Thursday just a gentle reminder AEC was the culprit who commented on June They were extremely negative about Southerns lack of results in their attempt to increase participation in the RTO They said Southern suggests no more than the possibility of another paper RTO proposal by December They do ask for a technical conference by FERC staff and then a settlement judge proceeding thereafter Joe Connor AM To James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Donna NRON cc Subject Re Southern RTO I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday They talked about what is going on with the nonjurisdictional utilities that have signed a MOU to develop a RTO The group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use Confidentiality agreements have been signed so no details are available but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development Southern has about one third of the votes and of the assets and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to carry a vote Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that Southern was not going to run or dominate the process After that Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the RTO work and resolve the hurdles the nonjurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other RTOs They said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldnt be sure agreement would be reached but at this point there was a lot of cooperation Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete RTO filing could be ready by They also said they thought this is what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development They said that it was too early to make any commitment but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible They said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different but they pointed out again that Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group In the meantime they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group Jim I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and Steve Kean and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come I dont think they want to discuss anything technical at this point they just want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area and they want any help we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southerns May th status report either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority Donna I guess thats who you meant in the memo below since AEC has signed a MOU with Southern I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we havent heard from EPSA on its filing I still think thats the best approach Donna Fulton PM To Joe nron Tom CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Subject Southern supplemental status report I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its RT on June They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO These are really general more of the same of what weve seen from Southern Also we had talked about possible comments on the May Southern filing Coral was working on comments through EPSA Nothing has been filed by EPSA yet Alabama did file comments on the May status report and they have asked that the FERC establish a technical conference to publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay Following a technical conference they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at FERC to undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop comments
