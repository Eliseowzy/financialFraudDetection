<22846639.1075861046189.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,officeofthechairman@nymex.com,2002-03-07 12:25:12,Letter from the Chairman to the MembershipMarch Dear NYMEX Member On the Proxy Statement and ballot you received for the upcoming Annual Meeting on March a proposal has been put forth by the Board of Directors to amend bylaw section of the NYMEX Exchange relating to the composition of the Executive Committee Currently that bylaw requires the Executive Committee to be composed of five members Under the proposed bylaw amendment the Board of Directors would be given the flexibility to set the number of members of the Committee As is the case today the Chairman Vice Chairman and Treasurer would sit on the Committee In the past year the Exchange has faced a number of challenges from the tragic events of September to the growth of competitive platforms I am proud to say that the Board of Directors has risen to the occasion and taken on these challenges head on with a high sense of involvement with and commitment to this institution By giving the Board the ability to set the size of the Executive Committee the Board will have the opportunity to tailor the Executive Committee size to a number which it believes will be effective in rapidly responding to circumstances at that time Depending on the individual Board this flexibility will enable the Exchange to capitalize on the level of involvement and specific skills of individual Board members by engaging the appropriate number of members in the decisionmaking process and by ensuring that all segments of the community are represented In addition from a corporate perspective the proposed amendment makes sense At the holding company level the Board of Directors now has the authority to set the number of members of the Executive Committee Approval of the proposed bylaw amendment would make the Boards authority consistent at both the holding company and exchange levels and would eliminate the potential for discrepancies between the parent company and the Exchange I strongly urge that you vote in favor of the proposal As Chairman of the Board I have learned much about the workings of this institution in the last year and believe that this proposal would enable this organization be more efficient and effective I appreciate your consideration of the proposal and look forward to working to address your needs in the coming year Sincerely Vincent Viola Chairman
