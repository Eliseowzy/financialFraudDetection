<13356361.1075859794289.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gail.brownfeld@enron.com,2001-03-23 05:18:00,New Lawsuit Against ANEEL and Furnas Cc I indicated in my earlier phonemail message Elektro would like authorization to bring two suits in Rio de Janeiro against ANEEL the Brazilian regulatory agency and Furnas a federal company acting as agent for power sales from Itaipu These suits would be based on these entities failure to allow Elektro to pass through certain increases in the cost of electricity to its customers Despite lengthy negotiations the parties have been unable to resolve their differences and it appears that a court challenge is the only way forward As I mentioned longwindedly in my phone mail the first suit would relate to an increase in the price of electricity which Elektro has been prevented due to the procedural wrangling and subterfuge of ANEEL from immediately passing on to its customers By way of background Elektro must buy in excess of of the electricity produced by Itaipu ANEEL has authorized Furnas to increase the cost of Itaipus electricity by approximately Elektro believes that pursuant to its concession contract it should be able to immediately pass this extraordinary increase along to its customers Instead of allowing this passthrough ANEEL has required Elektro to wait for the date of its annual rate adjustment to receive the increase In the meantime Elektro is required to absorb the increase with no retroactive adjustment available allowing it to recoup the increase It is my understanding that during the months before the rate increase is authorized Elektro loses approximately per month Accordingly Electro would like to file suit to obtain declaratory relief i supporting the immediate passthrough of any rate increase and ii injunctive relief to prevent imposition of sanctions andor interest The second suit contemplated by Elektro would involve not just the increase mentioned above but also would involve other increases that Elektro has had to bear without the benefit of an immediate passthrough to its customers Since in disregard of both the parties agreement and the law Elektro has been denied immediate passthroughs for a number of increases in the cost of electricity related taxes and other legal encumbrances According to Elektros calculations the amount in dispute in this bigger picture litigation is approximately million Mr Bermudes firm believe that the chances of winning both suits are very high and on the bigger picture suit has already provided this opinion in writing Other than the possible negative impact on Elektros relationship with ANEEL and the length of time the court in Rio could take to decide the matter years the downside to initiating the litigation does not seem great According to Elektro these suits would not jeopardize Elektros agreement to sell electricity and would result in nominal interest and penalty should they prove unsuccessful Please let me know if Elektro is authorized to proceed as set forth above Thanks

amenable to discussing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a going forward basis while continuing the fight over past breaches George said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats We would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient for us and we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to reflect todays market situation For example the current risk apportionment and price would have to be modified With that in mind do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions The last settlement effort was pretty useless and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background looking for cover What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a third party involved In the alternative would it be a good idea to involve you and Mel On a slightly related note I agree that we probably need to get a mitigation letter out but I dont necessarily want to send the one we had been discussing Perhaps something that makes clear that they have a continuing duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to resolve things Can you take a shot at it and get back to me Thanks in advance From Brownfeld Gail Sent Tuesday May AM To Mcclellan George Gregory A Markel Email Mcgowan Kevin Reck Daniel Arnold Matthew Gresham Wayne Cc Sanders Richard Subject Sempra LitigationConversation with Michael Goldstein Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the Rev Proc and its recent amendment After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation First he stated that he has been advised that the Rev Proc does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created before the Rev Proc qualifies for the tax credit He also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service date This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced According to Goldstein the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the Rev Proc When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date Michael didnt know He has agreed to find this number and get back to me After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev Proc Michael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford sp at VE who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Department about it I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I didnt know if this fellow was one of them He said that he had not talked to Price and had no idea what he would advise Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev Proc would serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to mitigate damages He stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and even moving the second machine back to Virginia When asked what was happening with the machine at Pier IX he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a source of coal for it I told Goldstein that I would visit with the Coal Guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of everything that has happened He said that he didnt think this was going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldnt be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem I suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sure the parties were on the same page about the Production Test coal size etc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a mediation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about November through the date of any deal going forward Please note that I made clear that I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra on this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire I told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was I would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one Finally I told him Id get with you guys and call him later today or tomorrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discussions Please give me call when you get a chance It might be a good idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available

called at trial Also their testimony is consistent with Michael Goldsteins comments to me that I didnt understand the implications of the ruling on these facilities Personally I think that Plattes testimony that he didnt officially certify the capacity of the machines in and therefore their capacity is unknown is sort of contrived and madeup sounding in light of the Rev Procand the miracle of hindsight The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didnt mean increase it from to tons per hour Also Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I dont think hes going to lie under oath maybe Im naive Regardless of the preceding comments it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W about these issues and also probably need to talk to the KM folks through their lawyer about this before the next round of depos On a related note I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several issues First I told him that if they were interested we were interested in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward I questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the equipment He said that this would be up to Mr Holmes but that he strongly doubted that repricing the deal or dramatically changing the economics of the deal would be acceptable I also asked whether he thought a mediation would be acceptable In response he indicated that although he wouldnt rule it out he thought it was premature Finally I mentioned that there had been some talk of deposing him He said that his only involvement in the negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra and therefore these communications would be privileged He said he only met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing other things He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLRs Let me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this Finally George is still out of town but as soon as he returns Ill get with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out Thanks Original Message From Johnson Christopher P ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJohnsonCChristopherPECCPJohnsonbrob eckEcomE NRONcom Sent Wednesday May PM To Markel Gregory A Brownfeld Gail Cc Setton Ronit Leit David Zeisler Aaron M Farache Olivier N Subject RW Beck Depos Greg and Gail Ive just completed the depositions of RW Beck Sempras independent engineers on the Blue GrassSomerset facilities Specifically I deposed Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning The testimony was generally unfavorable to us In particular I think they require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev Procs places limits on Sempras lost tax credit damage claim As you know IRS Rev Proc stated that a facility may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location It also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a o ruling is that the treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable This recent ruling from the IRS of course was inconsistent with Sempras May PLR request in which Richard Coston stated that another consequence of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical change Applying less pressures causes two changes to occur in the production process First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will be in the form of a briquette Second output capacity can be significantly increased We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the capacity of the Blue GrassSomerset facilities combined to tonsyear If one assumes hourday operation for daysyear each machine would need to have a tonhour capacity to reach this level Keith Martin told us that the increase in capacity under Rev Proc should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was placed in service prior to July As I told you a couple of weeks ago the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from RW Beck that the Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were placed in service on June In those certificates Beck certified a capacity for each machine of tonshour which for the machines means a max of tonsyear I concluded from this that because Sempras proposal to increase Blue GrassSomerset capacity by reducing the briquetting of the output had been rejected by Rev Proc Sempra would not be able to claim tax credits above those that could be produced at tonshour and that its damage claim would at the very least be capped at that level Keith Platte pronounced Platty the lead engineer for Beck and the guy who signed the certification poked a big hole in this conclusion Platte is very personable particularly for an engineer appears to know his field very well and in my estimation would make an excellent witness for Sempra should he be called Mel did not question Platte Regarding capacity Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or Enron facilities According to him the Engineering Procurement and Construction EPC contracts pursuant to which the facilities were constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at tonshour Platte said that RW Becks job was simply to certify that the facilities had indeed been constructed by in accordance with the EPC contracts meaning that as of that date the facilities had at least that capacity Did they have a capacity of tonshour on He cannot say because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of equipment in that facility He generally agreed with this fact and that a slow piece of equipment could act as a bottleneck I then tried to establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment particularly the briquetter I got nowhere He fell back on the proposition that if he did not test it he does not know the capacity limits He said that if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the briquetter I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer At the conclusion of the deposition I decided that that is what I would do I may still do that but after deposing Lance Hardesty today I am less confident that that would be a fruitful course of action Hardesty is not nearly as good a witness as Platte he has a kind of wimpy limphandshake dufus quality to him the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing with a sliderule when God was handing out personality Hardesty is however a very knowledgeable engineer To cut to the chase Hardesty weeks ago recertified the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at Somerset using the original Somerset design eg no screen before the crusher as it was designed at Norfolk Hardesty certified that the Blue Grass facility had a capacity today of at least tonshour Most significantly I asked Hardesty who participated in the certification to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from June and to identify all the changes in facility components between then and now There were not many and he believes Holmes will have to confirm that the significant components in the synfuel process the mixer the blender and the briquetter are all the same albeit with some modifications Thus Sempras argument will be that if those components were capable of producing tonshour in May they must have been capable of doing so in June the date the facility was placed in service What about the modifications I asked Hardesty to identify all of them Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings of the mixer were changed somewhat The blender also had replaced some internal pieces that wore out due to normal use These things do not sound significant to me but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me otherwise The briquetter is a different story Hardesty had earlier admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the things that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette think of a piece of charcoal Because of significant operational problems in the summer of they kept breaking the briquetters had to be reconfigured at the direction of the manufacturer Komar Industries Upon the completion of these modifications the briquetter rolls could be adjusted to achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from to Believe it or not I know what this means Hardesty said that during his visit to Somerset earlier this month the briquetter was set at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour He then ran a capacity test at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June were achieved and he said Certain improvements were made to the chute feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process so that the material would flow better in avoiding plugging But in June of we never attempted any sort of a maximum test we merely tested for the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility We then walked through each of the improvements In short other than the changes to the briquetter none of them struck me as the kind of thing that would offend the IRS Focusing on the briquetter I asked him why it had been set at He said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the briquetter had after the modifications were completed in Well need to confirm this I asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacing He did not According to Hardesty we discussed it with Richard Holmes Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston And for conservatism with regards to maintaining the IRS placedinservice ruling threequarter inch was selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on June of and in roughly the same proportion of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines In other words Sempra will argue to the IRS that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity in it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev Proc Thus Sempras most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT Costons May statement that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of briquetting Obviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempras new argument holds water For example how do they prove what the percent of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in June Also we should inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer we need to retain one so we can draw our own conclusions Finally we will need to grill Holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the person with all the relevant knowledge In sum while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony they at least give us the tools to rework our analysis on the possibility of using Rev Proc to limit Sempras lost tax credit damages Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks CPJ from La Guardia where I just landed Christopher P Johnson Brobeck Phleger

Christopher P Johnson Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Broadway New York New York Original Message From Martin Keith mailto Sent Friday July PM To Subject Sempra tax rate Greg and Chris As best we can tell Sempra is not in a position currently to use section tax credits This is based on the following bits of evidence A company cannot claim section tax credits in years when it pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax rather than the regular corporate income tax Section credits cannot be carried forward A company must use them or lose them The one exception is in a year when the company is on the alternative minimum tax the credit turns into a socalled AMT credit and can be carried forward It must be used in that case in the first year the company comes off the AMT It appears from Sempras K that it was in a net operating loss position in The company shows current federal income taxes of million It also shows deferred federal income taxes last year of million According to Morris Meltzer tax director at PGEs unregulated affiliate this means that the company had more book income than taxable income last year The deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity Sempras Q for the first quarter shows positive current tax liability of million However Jack Casey vice chairman of Meridian Investments told me that Sempra expects to be in a net operating loss position for the year Meridian has been hired by Sempra to sell Sempras interest in the Carbonronics syncoal facilities I asked Casey why Sempra wants to sell is it because it cant use the tax credits or because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad publicity Casey said it cannot use the tax credits

be amenable to discu ssing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a going forward basis while continuing the fight over past breaches George said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats We would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient fo r us and we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to r eflect todays market situation For example the current risk apportionmen t and price would have to be modified With that in mind do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions The last settlement effort was pretty us eless and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background look ing for cover What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a t hird party involved In the alternative would it be a good idea to involve you and Mel On a slightly related note I agree that we probably need to get a mitig ation letter out but I dont necessarily want to send the one we had been d iscussing Perhaps

Michael Goldstein Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in ligh t of the Rev Proc and its recent amendment After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax adv ice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situat ion First he stated that he has been advised that the Rev Proc does no t apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make chang es going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created b efore the Rev Proc qualifies for the tax credit He also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look a t what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service d ate This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced Acco rding to Goldstein the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modificati ons to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inco nsistent with the intent of the Rev Proc When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date Michael didnt know He has agreed to find this number and get back to me After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev Proc Mich ael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford sp at VE who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Departmen t about it I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I di dnt know if this fellow was one of them He said that he had not talked t o Price and had no idea what he would advise Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev Proc wou ld serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order t o mitigate damages He stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and even moving the second machine back to Virginia When asked what was happening with the machine at Pier IX he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a sour ce of coal for it I told Goldstein that I would visit with the Coal Guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in l ight of everything that has happened He said that he didnt think this wa s going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldn t be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a p roblem I suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sur e the parties were on the same page about the Production Test coal size e tc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a me diation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about November through the date of any deal going forward Please note that I made clear t hat I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra o n this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire I told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was I would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one Finally I told him Id get with you guys and call him later today or to morrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discuss ions Please give me call when you get a chance It might be a good idea t o set up a call later this afternoon if you are available

certainly be called at trial Also their testimony is co nsistent with Michael Goldsteins comments to me that I didnt understand t he implications of the ruling on these facilities Personally I think that Plattes testimony that he didnt officially ce rtify the capacity of the machines in and therefore their capacity i s unknown is sort of contrived and madeup sounding in light of the Rev Pr ocand the miracle of hindsight The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn t mean increase it from to tons per hour Also Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I dont think hes going to lie under oath maybe Im naive Regardless of the preceding comments it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K M folks through their lawyer about this before the next round of depos On a related note I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about sever al issues First I told him that if they were interested we were interes ted in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward I qu estioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the equipment He said that this would be up to Mr Holmes but that he strong ly doubted that repricing the deal or dramatically changing the economic s of the deal would be acceptable I also asked whether he thought a medi ation would be acceptable In response he indicated that although he woul dnt rule it out he thought it was premature Finally I mentioned that th ere had been some talk of deposing him He said that his only involvement in the negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra and therefore these communications would be privileged He sai d he only met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in Augu st and this was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly b usy doing other things He also said that he had no involvement with the IR S PLRs Let me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this Finally George is still out of town but as soon as he

CEANOTESJohnsonCChristopherPECCPJohnsonbrobeckEc omE NRONcom SentWednesday May PM ToMarkel Gregory A Brownfeld Gail CcSetton Ronit Leit David Zeisler Aaron M Farache Olivier N SubjectRW Beck Depos Greg and Gail Ive just completed the depositions of RW Beck Sempras independent engineers on the Blue GrassSomerset facilities Specifically I deposed Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning The testimony was generally unfavorable to us In particular I think they require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev Procs places limits on Sempras lost tax credit damage claim As you know IRS Rev Proc stated that a facility may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location It also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a ruling is that the treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the credit is allowable This recent ruling from the IRS of course was inconsistent with Sempras May PLR request in which Richard Coston stated that another consequenc e of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical change Applying less pressures causes two changes to occur in the production process First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will be in the form of a briquette Second output capacity can be significantl y increased We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the capacity of the Blue GrassSomerset facilities combined to tonsyear If one assumes hourday operation for daysyear each machine would need to have a tonhour capacity to reach this level Keith Martin told us that the increase in capacity under Rev Proc should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was placed in service prior to July As I told you a couple of weeks ago the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from RW Beck that th e Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were placed in service on June In those certificates Beck certified a capacity for each machine of tonshour which for the machines means a max of tonsyear I concluded from this that because Sempras proposal to increase Blue GrassSomerset capacity by reducing the briquetting of the output had been rejected by Rev Proc Sempra would not be able to claim tax credits above those that could be produced at tonshour and that its damage claim would at the very least be capped at that level Keith Platte pronounced Platty the lead engineer for Beck and the guy who signed the certification poked a big hole in this conclusion Platte is very personable particularly for an engineer appears to know his fiel d very well and in my estimation would make an excellent witness for Sempra should he be called Mel did not question Platte Regarding capacity Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or Enron facilities According to him the Engineering Procurement and Construction EPC contracts pursuant to which the facilities were constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at tonshour Platte said that RW Becks job was simply to certify that the facilities had indeed been constructed by in accordance with the EP C contracts meaning that as of that date the facilities had at least that capacity Did they have a capacity of tonshour on He cannot say because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of equipment in that facility He generally agreed with this fact and that a slow piece of equipment could act as a bottleneck I then tried to establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment particularly the briquetter I got nowhere He fell back on the proposition that if he did not test it he does not know the capacity limits He said that if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the briquetter I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer At the conclusion of the deposition I decided that that is what I would do I may still do that but after deposing Lance Hardesty today I am less confident that that would be a fruitful course of action Hardesty is not nearly as good a witness as Platte he has a kind of wimpy limphandshake dufus quality to him the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing wit h a sliderule when God was handing out personality Hardesty is however a very knowledgeable engineer To cut to the chase Hardesty weeks ago recertified the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at Somerset using the original Somerset design eg no screen before the crusher as it was designed at Norfolk Hardesty certified that the Blue Grass facility had a capacity today of at least tonshour Most significantly I asked Hardesty who participated in the certification to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from June and to identify all the changes in facility components between then and now There were not many and he believes Holmes will have to confirm that the significant components in the synfuel process the mixer the blender and the briquetter are all the same albeit with some modifications Thus Sempras argument will be that if those components were capable of producing tonshour in May they must have been capable of doing so in June the date the facility was placed in service What about the modifications I asked Hardesty to identify all of them Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings of the mixer were changed somewhat The blender also had replaced some internal pieces that wore out due to normal use These things do not soun d significant to me but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me otherwise The briquetter is a different story Hardesty had earlier admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the thing s that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette think of a piece of charcoal Because of significant operational problems in th e summer of they kept breaking the briquetters had to be reconfigured at the direction of the manufacturer Komar Industries Upon the completion of these modifications the briquetter rolls could be adjusted t o achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from to Believe it or not I know what this means Hardesty said that during his visit to Somerset earlier this month the briquetter was set at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour He then ran a capacity test at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June were achieved and he said Certain improvements were made to the chut e feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process so that the material would flow better in avoiding plugging But in June of we never attempted any sort of a maximum test we merely tested for the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility We then walked through each of the improvements In short other than th e changes to the briquetter none of them struck me as the kind of thing that would offend the IRS Focusing on the briquetter I asked him why it had been set at He said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the briquetter had after the modifications were completed in Well need to confirm this I asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacing He did not According to Hardesty we discussed it with Richard Holmes Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston And for conservatism with regards to maintaining the IRS placedinservice ruling threequarter inch was selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on June of and in roughly the same proportion of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines In other words Sempra will argue to the IRS that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity in it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev Proc Thus Sempras most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT Costons May statement that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of briquetting Obviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempras new argument holds water For example how do they prove what the percent of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in June Also we should inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer we need to retain one so we can draw our own conclusions Finally we will need to grill Holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the perso n with all the relevant knowledge In sum while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony they at least give us the tools to rework our analysis on the possibility of using Rev Proc to limit Sempras lost tax credit damages Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks CPJ

Markel Gregory A Cc Brownfeld Gail Zeisler Aaron M Subject Tom McQuades Deposition Greg Tom McQuades deposition was an adventure I spent all day Monday prepping him and I could not get him to say a word When I asked him about the issues re Massey he said he remembers talking to Massey but he didnt discuss buying coal from Massey McQuade said that his focus was on selling the synfuel output and that Matt Arnold must have had the discussions with Massey re buying coal Massey had an internal memo saying that McQuade referenced a need for a top size because of Sempras PLR but McQuade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about the PLR never discussed in the context of coal as opposed to synfuel and said that Matt must have had those discussions In short based on the fact that McQuade wouldnt talk to me I figured this depo would be a breeze When we got to the depo however McQuade became Chatty Cathy He had the opportunity to take use one word answers but he routinely felt a need to expound For the most part it didnt matter because Jonathan Siegel was taking the depo and was getting nowhere I kept reminding McQuade during breaks to answer and shut up and he kept acknowledging that that was what he would do Once we resumed the depo however he kept falling back into his habit of saying too much In the afternoon I cut him off at points Youve answered that question Now wait for the next one More importantly McQuades testimony regarding Massey began to sound evasive to me He was looking back and forth at the internal Massey correspondence as if a light had gone off in his head but was still saying that he didnt discuss purchasing coal The Massey stuff is not a big issue in the case and I started fearing that McQuades testimony would make it one eg they read in the Massey depo read parts of McQuade and then say that McQuade lied about it McQuade had one other big screwup after testifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within x coal McQuade said near the end of the day that he told someone in Enron in November that x has x coal During a break late in the afternoon I asked McQuade what happened with the Massey testimony He said that after seeing again the internal Massey memo written by a guy McQuade knows and trusts saying that McQuade referenced a PLR and a top size he began to believe that he MUST have said that to the Massey guy I asked McQuade what he recalled about it He said that he really didnt recall anything other than that he might have referenced size He still didnt think he referenced a PLR He then told me that the meeting referenced in the memo was a dinner meeting hed had a few drinks etc I then asked McQuade about the size distribution testimony I suggested to him that might be the an outside limit of x coal in x and McQuade agreed Based upon the foregoing I asked McQuade just a handful of questions when Siegel finished it was we started at I think it is the first time I ever asked cleanup questions of my own witness but I didnt want this testimony to stand as it was and I was sure that I would not want McQuade at trial to clean it up then The size distribution testimony went smoothly McQuade reiterated his testimony from earlier in the day re the many factors that affect the size distribution within x and that because of those factors there can be no standard distribution I then asked what he meant when he gave the testimony he said that that was the upper limit and that it was by no means a standard Enough said on the issue I dropped it Re Massey I directed McQuades attention to the internal Massey memo and asked whether it refreshed his recollection about discussing coal size with Massey McQuade said that because he knows the author of the memo if the author says McQuade referenced coal size McQuade must have done so McQuade then said that he still doesnt recall any details whatsoever about the discussion having had drinks over dinner etc He also testified that notwithstanding the reference to a PLR in the memo he still didnt think he referenced a PLR because McQuade doesnt think he even knew about a PLR McQuade surmised that the Massey guy might have just been assuming that a PLR was involved Siegel then tried to question McQuade again about the Massey meeting but he did nothing but screw up the record McQuade for example testified for the first time Siegel hadnt asked before that hed actually had meetings with Massey the second one being with Matt Arnold and Kevin McGowan While Siegel was questioning I started packing up my things as a reminder to Siegel that McQuade had a flight to catch Siegel took the bait and after muddying up the record some more he decided to terminate the deposition rather than keep McQuade there to learn about his new recollection Siegel said he had no further questions and McQuade and I were out of the building in seconds Bottom line McQuade was a below average to bad witness but he ultimately didnt damage our record Because Mel will likely come back at Matt Arnold about the Massey meetings in an effort to clean up what Siegel left so muddy we should be prepared for that CPJ Christopher P Johnson Brobeck

amenable to discussing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a going forward basis while continuing the fight over past breaches George said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats We would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient for us and we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to reflect todays market situation For example the current risk apportionment and price would have to be modified With that in mind do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions The last settlement effort was pretty useless and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background looking for cover What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a third party involved In the alternative would it be a good idea to involve you and Mel On a slightly related note I agree that we probably need to get a mitigation letter out but I dont necessarily want to send the one we had been discussing Perhaps something that makes clear that they have a continuing duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to resolve things Can you take a shot at it and get back to me Thanks in advance From Brownfeld Gail Sent Tuesday May AM To Mcclellan George Gregory A Markel Email Mcgowan Kevin Reck Daniel Arnold Matthew Gresham Wayne Cc Sanders Richard Subject Sempra LitigationConversation with Michael Goldstein Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the Rev Proc and its recent amendment After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation First he stated that he has been advised that the Rev Proc does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created before the Rev Proc qualifies for the tax credit He also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service date This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced According to Goldstein the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the Rev Proc When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date Michael didnt know He has agreed to find this number and get back to me After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev Proc Michael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford sp at VE who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Department about it I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I didnt know if this fellow was one of them He said that he had not talked to Price and had no idea what he would advise Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev Proc would serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to mitigate damages He stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and even moving the second machine back to Virginia When asked what was happening with the machine at Pier IX he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a source of coal for it I told Goldstein that I would visit with the Coal Guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of everything that has happened He said that he didnt think this was going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldnt be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem I suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sure the parties were on the same page about the Production Test coal size etc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a mediation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about November through the date of any deal going forward Please note that I made clear that I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra on this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire I told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was I would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one Finally I told him Id get with you guys and call him later today or tomorrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discussions Please give me call when you get a chance It might be a good idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available

called at trial Also their testimony is consistent with Michael Goldsteins comments to me that I didnt understand the implications of the ruling on these facilities Personally I think that Plattes testimony that he didnt officially certify the capacity of the machines in and therefore their capacity is unknown is sort of contrived and madeup sounding in light of the Rev Procand the miracle of hindsight The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didnt mean increase it from to tons per hour Also Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I dont think hes going to lie under oath maybe Im naive Regardless of the preceding comments it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W about these issues and also probably need to talk to the KM folks through their lawyer about this before the next round of depos On a related note I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several issues First I told him that if they were interested we were interested in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward I questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the equipment He said that this would be up to Mr Holmes but that he strongly doubted that repricing the deal or dramatically changing the economics of the deal would be acceptable I also asked whether he thought a mediation would be acceptable In response he indicated that although he wouldnt rule it out he thought it was premature Finally I mentioned that there had been some talk of deposing him He said that his only involvement in the negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra and therefore these communications would be privileged He said he only met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing other things He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLRs Let me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this Finally George is still out of town but as soon as he returns Ill get with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out Thanks Original Message From Johnson Christopher P ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJohnsonCChristopherPECCPJohnsonbrob eckEcomE NRONcom Sent Wednesday May PM To Markel Gregory A Brownfeld Gail Cc Setton Ronit Leit David Zeisler Aaron M Farache Olivier N Subject RW Beck Depos Greg and Gail Ive just completed the depositions of RW Beck Sempras independent engineers on the Blue GrassSomerset facilities Specifically I deposed Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning The testimony was generally unfavorable to us In particular I think they require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev Procs places limits on Sempras lost tax credit damage claim As you know IRS Rev Proc stated that a facility may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location It also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a o ruling is that the treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable This recent ruling from the IRS of course was inconsistent with Sempras May PLR request in which Richard Coston stated that another consequence of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical change Applying less pressures causes two changes to occur in the production process First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will be in the form of a briquette Second output capacity can be significantly increased We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the capacity of the Blue GrassSomerset facilities combined to tonsyear If one assumes hourday operation for daysyear each machine would need to have a tonhour capacity to reach this level Keith Martin told us that the increase in capacity under Rev Proc should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was placed in service prior to July As I told you a couple of weeks ago the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from RW Beck that the Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were placed in service on June In those certificates Beck certified a capacity for each machine of tonshour which for the machines means a max of tonsyear I concluded from this that because Sempras proposal to increase Blue GrassSomerset capacity by reducing the briquetting of the output had been rejected by Rev Proc Sempra would not be able to claim tax credits above those that could be produced at tonshour and that its damage claim would at the very least be capped at that level Keith Platte pronounced Platty the lead engineer for Beck and the guy who signed the certification poked a big hole in this conclusion Platte is very personable particularly for an engineer appears to know his field very well and in my estimation would make an excellent witness for Sempra should he be called Mel did not question Platte Regarding capacity Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or Enron facilities According to him the Engineering Procurement and Construction EPC contracts pursuant to which the facilities were constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at tonshour Platte said that RW Becks job was simply to certify that the facilities had indeed been constructed by in accordance with the EPC contracts meaning that as of that date the facilities had at least that capacity Did they have a capacity of tonshour on He cannot say because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of equipment in that facility He generally agreed with this fact and that a slow piece of equipment could act as a bottleneck I then tried to establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment particularly the briquetter I got nowhere He fell back on the proposition that if he did not test it he does not know the capacity limits He said that if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the briquetter I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer At the conclusion of the deposition I decided that that is what I would do I may still do that but after deposing Lance Hardesty today I am less confident that that would be a fruitful course of action Hardesty is not nearly as good a witness as Platte he has a kind of wimpy limphandshake dufus quality to him the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing with a sliderule when God was handing out personality Hardesty is however a very knowledgeable engineer To cut to the chase Hardesty weeks ago recertified the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at Somerset using the original Somerset design eg no screen before the crusher as it was designed at Norfolk Hardesty certified that the Blue Grass facility had a capacity today of at least tonshour Most significantly I asked Hardesty who participated in the certification to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from June and to identify all the changes in facility components between then and now There were not many and he believes Holmes will have to confirm that the significant components in the synfuel process the mixer the blender and the briquetter are all the same albeit with some modifications Thus Sempras argument will be that if those components were capable of producing tonshour in May they must have been capable of doing so in June the date the facility was placed in service What about the modifications I asked Hardesty to identify all of them Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings of the mixer were changed somewhat The blender also had replaced some internal pieces that wore out due to normal use These things do not sound significant to me but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me otherwise The briquetter is a different story Hardesty had earlier admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the things that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette think of a piece of charcoal Because of significant operational problems in the summer of they kept breaking the briquetters had to be reconfigured at the direction of the manufacturer Komar Industries Upon the completion of these modifications the briquetter rolls could be adjusted to achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from to Believe it or not I know what this means Hardesty said that during his visit to Somerset earlier this month the briquetter was set at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour He then ran a capacity test at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June were achieved and he said Certain improvements were made to the chute feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process so that the material would flow better in avoiding plugging But in June of we never attempted any sort of a maximum test we merely tested for the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility We then walked through each of the improvements In short other than the changes to the briquetter none of them struck me as the kind of thing that would offend the IRS Focusing on the briquetter I asked him why it had been set at He said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the briquetter had after the modifications were completed in Well need to confirm this I asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacing He did not According to Hardesty we discussed it with Richard Holmes Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston And for conservatism with regards to maintaining the IRS placedinservice ruling threequarter inch was selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on June of and in roughly the same proportion of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines In other words Sempra will argue to the IRS that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity in it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev Proc Thus Sempras most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT Costons May statement that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of briquetting Obviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempras new argument holds water For example how do they prove what the percent of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in June Also we should inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer we need to retain one so we can draw our own conclusions Finally we will need to grill Holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the person with all the relevant knowledge In sum while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony they at least give us the tools to rework our analysis on the possibility of using Rev Proc to limit Sempras lost tax credit damages Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks CPJ from La Guardia where I just landed Christopher P Johnson Brobeck Phleger

whether Enron would be amenable to discu ssing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a going forward basis while continuing the fight over past breaches George said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats We would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient fo r us and we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to r eflect todays market situation For example the current risk apportionmen t and price would have to be modified With that in mind do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions The last settlement effort was pretty us eless and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background look ing for cover What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a t hird party involved In the alternative would it be a good idea to involve you and Mel On a slightly related note I agree that we probably need to get a mitig ation letter out but I dont necessarily want to send the one we had been d iscussing Perhaps something that makes clear that they have a continuing duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to resolve thin gs Can you take a shot at it and get back to

LitigationConversation with Michael Goldstein Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in ligh t of the Rev Proc and its recent amendment After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax adv ice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situat ion First he stated that he has been advised that the Rev Proc does no t apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make chang es going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created b efore the Rev Proc qualifies for the tax credit He also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look a t what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service d ate This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced Acco rding to Goldstein the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modificati ons to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inco nsistent with the intent of the Rev Proc When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date Michael didnt know He has agreed to find this number and get back to me After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev Proc Mich ael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford sp at VE who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Departmen t about it I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I di dnt know if this fellow was one of them He said that he had not talked t o Price and had no idea what he would advise Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev Proc wou ld serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order t o mitigate damages He stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and even moving the second machine back to Virginia When asked what was happening with the machine at Pier IX he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a sour ce of coal for it I told Goldstein that I would visit with the Coal Guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in l ight of everything that has happened He said that he didnt think this wa s going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldn t be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a p roblem I suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sur e the parties were on the same page about the Production Test coal size e tc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a me diation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about November through the date of any deal going forward Please note that I made clear t hat I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra o n this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire I told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was I would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one Finally I told him Id get with you guys and call him later today or to morrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discuss ions Please give me call when you get a chance It might be a good idea t o set up a call later this afternoon if you are available

that they will certainly be called at trial Also their testimony is co nsistent with Michael Goldsteins comments to me that I didnt understand t he implications of the ruling on these facilities Personally I think that Plattes testimony that he didnt officially ce rtify the capacity of the machines in and therefore their capacity i s unknown is sort of contrived and madeup sounding in light of the Rev Pr ocand the miracle of hindsight The Sempra representations to the IRS that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn t mean increase it from to tons per hour Also Coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I dont think hes going to lie under oath maybe Im naive Regardless of the preceding comments it sounds like we probably need to talk to Tim W about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K M folks through their lawyer about this before the next round of depos On a related note I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about sever al issues First I told him that if they were interested we were interes ted in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward I qu estioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the equipment He said that this would be up to Mr Holmes but that he strong ly doubted that repricing the deal or dramatically changing the economic s of the deal would be acceptable I also asked whether he thought a medi ation would be acceptable In response he indicated that although he woul dnt rule it out he thought it was premature Finally I mentioned that th ere had been some talk of deposing him He said that his only involvement in the negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra and therefore these communications would be privileged He sai d he only met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in Augu st and this was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly b usy doing other things He also said that he had no involvement with the IR S PLRs Let me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this Finally George is still out of town but

CEANOTESJohnsonCChristopherPECCPJohnsonbrobeckEc omE NRONcom SentWednesday May PM ToMarkel Gregory A Brownfeld Gail CcSetton Ronit Leit David Zeisler Aaron M Farache Olivier N SubjectRW Beck Depos Greg and Gail Ive just completed the depositions of RW Beck Sempras independent engineers on the Blue GrassSomerset facilities Specifically I deposed Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning The testimony was generally unfavorable to us In particular I think they require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev Procs places limits on Sempras lost tax credit damage claim As you know IRS Rev Proc stated that a facility may be relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location It also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a ruling is that the treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure that results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or the taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not significantly increase the production output of the facility over the remainder of the period during which the credit is allowable This recent ruling from the IRS of course was inconsistent with Sempras May PLR request in which Richard Coston stated that another consequenc e of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical change Applying less pressures causes two changes to occur in the production process First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will be in the form of a briquette Second output capacity can be significantl y increased We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the capacity of the Blue GrassSomerset facilities combined to tonsyear If one assumes hourday operation for daysyear each machine would need to have a tonhour capacity to reach this level Keith Martin told us that the increase in capacity under Rev Proc should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was placed in service prior to July As I told you a couple of weeks ago the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from RW Beck that th e Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were placed in service on June In those certificates Beck certified a capacity for each machine of tonshour which for the machines means a max of tonsyear I concluded from this that because Sempras proposal to increase Blue GrassSomerset capacity by reducing the briquetting of the output had been rejected by Rev Proc Sempra would not be able to claim tax credits above those that could be produced at tonshour and that its damage claim would at the very least be capped at that level Keith Platte pronounced Platty the lead engineer for Beck and the guy who signed the certification poked a big hole in this conclusion Platte is very personable particularly for an engineer appears to know his fiel d very well and in my estimation would make an excellent witness for Sempra should he be called Mel did not question Platte Regarding capacity Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or Enron facilities According to him the Engineering Procurement and Construction EPC contracts pursuant to which the facilities were constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at tonshour Platte said that RW Becks job was simply to certify that the facilities had indeed been constructed by in accordance with the EP C contracts meaning that as of that date the facilities had at least that capacity Did they have a capacity of tonshour on He cannot say because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of equipment in that facility He generally agreed with this fact and that a slow piece of equipment could act as a bottleneck I then tried to establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment particularly the briquetter I got nowhere He fell back on the proposition that if he did not test it he does not know the capacity limits He said that if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the briquetter I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer At the conclusion of the deposition I decided that that is what I would do I may still do that but after deposing Lance Hardesty today I am less confident that that would be a fruitful course of action Hardesty is not nearly as good a witness as Platte he has a kind of wimpy limphandshake dufus quality to him the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing wit h a sliderule when God was handing out personality Hardesty is however a very knowledgeable engineer To cut to the chase Hardesty weeks ago recertified the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at Somerset using the original Somerset design eg no screen before the crusher as it was designed at Norfolk Hardesty certified that the Blue Grass facility had a capacity today of at least tonshour Most significantly I asked Hardesty who participated in the certification to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from June and to identify all the changes in facility components between then and now There were not many and he believes Holmes will have to confirm that the significant components in the synfuel process the mixer the blender and the briquetter are all the same albeit with some modifications Thus Sempras argument will be that if those components were capable of producing tonshour in May they must have been capable of doing so in June the date the facility was placed in service What about the modifications I asked Hardesty to identify all of them Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings of the mixer were changed somewhat The blender also had replaced some internal pieces that wore out due to normal use These things do not soun d significant to me but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me otherwise The briquetter is a different story Hardesty had earlier admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the thing s that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette think of a piece of charcoal Because of significant operational problems in th e summer of they kept breaking the briquetters had to be reconfigured at the direction of the manufacturer Komar Industries Upon the completion of these modifications the briquetter rolls could be adjusted t o achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from to Believe it or not I know what this means Hardesty said that during his visit to Somerset earlier this month the briquetter was set at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour He then ran a capacity test at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June were achieved and he said Certain improvements were made to the chut e feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process so that the material would flow better in avoiding plugging But in June of we never attempted any sort of a maximum test we merely tested for the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility We then walked through each of the improvements In short other than th e changes to the briquetter none of them struck me as the kind of thing that would offend the IRS Focusing on the briquetter I asked him why it had been set at He said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the briquetter had after the modifications were completed in Well need to confirm this I asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacing He did not According to Hardesty we discussed it with Richard Holmes Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston And for conservatism with regards to maintaining the IRS placedinservice ruling threequarter inch was selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on June of and in roughly the same proportion of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines In other words Sempra will argue to the IRS that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity in it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev Proc Thus Sempras most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT Costons May statement that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of briquetting Obviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempras new argument holds water For example how do they prove what the percent of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in June Also we should inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer we need to retain one so we can draw our own conclusions Finally we will need to grill Holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the perso n with all the relevant knowledge In sum while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony they at least give us the tools to rework our analysis on the possibility of using Rev Proc to limit Sempras lost tax credit damages Please let me know if you have any questions Thanks CPJ

Wednesday July PM To Markel Gregory A Cc Brownfeld Gail Zeisler Aaron M Subject Tom McQuades Deposition Greg Tom McQuades deposition was an adventure I spent all day Monday prepping him and I could not get him to say a word When I asked him about the issues re Massey he said he remembers talking to Massey but he didnt discuss buying coal from Massey McQuade said that his focus was on selling the synfuel output and that Matt Arnold must have had the discussions with Massey re buying coal Massey had an internal memo saying that McQuade referenced a need for a top size because of Sempras PLR but McQuade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about the PLR never discussed in the context of coal as opposed to synfuel and said that Matt must have had those discussions In short based on the fact that McQuade wouldnt talk to me I figured this depo would be a breeze When we got to the depo however McQuade became Chatty Cathy He had the opportunity to take use one word answers but he routinely felt a need to expound For the most part it didnt matter because Jonathan Siegel was taking the depo and was getting nowhere I kept reminding McQuade during breaks to answer and shut up and he kept acknowledging that that was what he would do Once we resumed the depo however he kept falling back into his habit of saying too much In the afternoon I cut him off at points Youve answered that question Now wait for the next one More importantly McQuades testimony regarding Massey began to sound evasive to me He was looking back and forth at the internal Massey correspondence as if a light had gone off in his head but was still saying that he didnt discuss purchasing coal The Massey stuff is not a big issue in the case and I started fearing that McQuades testimony would make it one eg they read in the Massey depo read parts of McQuade and then say that McQuade lied about it McQuade had one other big screwup after testifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within x coal McQuade said near the end of the day that he told someone in Enron in November that x has x coal During a break late in the afternoon I asked McQuade what happened with the Massey testimony He said that after seeing again the internal Massey memo written by a guy McQuade knows and trusts saying that McQuade referenced a PLR and a top size he began to believe that he MUST have said that to the Massey guy I asked McQuade what he recalled about it He said that he really didnt recall anything other than that he might have referenced size He still didnt think he referenced a PLR He then told me that the meeting referenced in the memo was a dinner meeting hed had a few drinks etc I then asked McQuade about the size distribution testimony I suggested to him that might be the an outside limit of x coal in x and McQuade agreed Based upon the foregoing I asked McQuade just a handful of questions when Siegel finished it was we started at I think it is the first time I ever asked cleanup questions of my own witness but I didnt want this testimony to stand as it was and I was sure that I would not want McQuade at trial to clean it up then The size distribution testimony went smoothly McQuade reiterated his testimony from earlier in the day re the many factors that affect the size distribution within x and that because of those factors there can be no standard distribution I then asked what he meant when he gave the testimony he said that that was the upper limit and that it was by no means a standard Enough said on the issue I dropped it Re Massey I directed McQuades attention to the internal Massey memo and asked whether it refreshed his recollection about discussing coal size with Massey McQuade said that because he knows the author of the memo if the author says McQuade referenced coal size McQuade must have done so McQuade then said that he still doesnt recall any details whatsoever about the discussion having had drinks over dinner etc He also testified that notwithstanding the reference to a PLR in the memo he still didnt think he referenced a PLR because McQuade doesnt think he even knew about a PLR McQuade surmised that the Massey guy might have just been assuming that a PLR was involved Siegel then tried to question McQuade again about the Massey meeting but he did nothing but screw up the record McQuade for example testified for the first time Siegel hadnt asked before that hed actually had meetings with Massey the second one being with Matt Arnold and Kevin McGowan While Siegel was questioning I started packing up my things as a reminder to Siegel that McQuade had a flight to catch Siegel took the bait and after muddying up the record some more he decided to terminate the deposition rather than keep McQuade there to learn about his new recollection Siegel said he had no further questions and McQuade and I were out of the building in seconds Bottom line McQuade was a below average to bad witness but he ultimately didnt damage our record Because Mel will likely come back at Matt Arnold about the Massey meetings in an effort to clean up what Siegel left so muddy we should be prepared for that CPJ Christopher P

of the email and read up George do we have any intelligence on the Carbontronics deal Original Message From Johnson Christopher P mailto Sent Tuesday July PM To Brownfeld Gail Cc Mcclellan George Markel Gregory A Subject FW Sempra tax rate Gail Please see below Weve been after Sempra for some time to produce info re Sempra Energys other Section deals and they have seemed reluctant to produce the info I can understand why Its a little difficult to argue that crushing coal disables you from getting tax credits when your corporate parent is claiming tax credits from precisely that kind of operation Ill let you know as soon as we finally get the Carbontronics production out of Sempra CPJ Christopher P Johnson Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Broadway New York New York Original Message From Martin Keith mailto Sent Monday July PM To Johnson Christopher P Cc Markel Gregory A Zeisler Aaron M Subject RE Sempra tax rate Chris Sempra holds its interest in Carbontronics through Sempra Energy Financial Corporation its unregulated investment subsidiary I have lost track of what the projects are doing but when they were originally put in service in the plan was to use as feedstock highmoisture lowsulfur lowBtu subbituminous coal at two of the projects and a mix of coal fines or waste coal blended with whole coal at the other two at least thats what we told the IRS in the ruling requests The IRS ruling allows whole coal It says nothing about any size limit Keith Original Message From Johnson Christopher P mailto Sent Monday July PM To Martin Keith Cc Markel Gregory A Zeisler Aaron M Subject RE Sempra tax rate Keith You mention below that Sempra wants to sell its interest in Carbontronics We learned in April that Sempra itself as opposed to Sempras subsidiaries has a direct syncoal investment but we have been trying since then to get Sempra to identify it for us I am assuming Carbontronics is it You have previously described that project as a crush and glue project which would be a good thing for us since that is what Sempras sub is asserting does not qualify for tax credits Do you have any other info re Carbontronics operations or Sempras investment in it Thanks CPJ Christopher P Johnson Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Broadway New York New York Original Message From Martin Keith mailto Sent Friday July PM To Subject Sempra tax rate Greg and Chris As best we can tell Sempra is not in a position currently to use section tax credits This is based on the following bits of evidence A company cannot claim section tax credits in years when it pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax rather than the regular corporate income tax Section credits cannot be carried forward A company must use them or lose them The one exception is in a year when the company is on the alternative minimum tax the credit turns into a socalled AMT credit and can be carried forward It must be used in that case in the first year the company comes off the AMT It appears from Sempras K that it was in a net operating loss position in The company shows current federal income taxes of million It also shows deferred federal income taxes last year of million According to Morris Meltzer tax director at PGEs unregulated affiliate this means that the company had more book income than taxable income last year The deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity Sempras Q for the first quarter shows positive current tax liability of million However Jack Casey vice chairman of Meridian Investments told me that Sempra expects to be in a net operating loss position for the year Meridian has been hired by Sempra to sell Sempras interest in the Carbonronics syncoal facilities I asked Casey why Sempra wants to sell is it because it cant use the tax credits or because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad publicity Casey said it cannot use the tax credits In other news the IRS has not budged on its plan to limit the capacity of plants to which it issues rulings to absurdly low numbers The industry has complained to the Treasury and there have been discussions at senior levels of Treasury and the IRS but no reports back on where these internal talks are headed Detroit Edison has a meeting with the IRS on its ruling request next Tuesday The IRS has said it will limit capacity at the DTE facility to tons a year I assume you saw the article last Thursday in the Wall Street Journal about syncoal projects It was on the front page As far as I can tell all proposed sales of syncoal plants in the market are on hold This is a consequence of the Wall Street Journal article and the impasse with the IRS over capacity The industry is starting to think it may have won a political battle earlier this year at Treasury but lost the war The IRS bureaucrats will have the final say Joe Makurath the IRS rulings group chief said he is getting a number of FOIA requests for documents about projects on which the IRS has already ruled He said he intends to be liberal in releasing information There are rumors that the Wall Street Journal may be one of the organizations seeking information and may be at work on a followup article The IRS launched an audit of four projects in West Virginia and Virginia that many people consider to be on the best end of the spectrum The projects already have rulings that they qualify for credits The IRS appears to be gathering evidence to argue that they did not get into service in time to qualify for tax credits or else that the projects failed to comply with the rulings It is sending out big guns from Chicago and one agent told the taxpayer that the IRS national office said dont worry about expense on this one I will try over the weekend to give you my comments on the deposition transcripts Sorry for the delay If you dont find them when you come in on Monday they will be first on my todo list that

<25183749.1075853250567.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,gail.brownfeld@enron.com,2001-05-08 04:32:00,Sempra LitigationConversation with Michael Goldstein Cc Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the Rev Proc and its recent amendment After apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation First he stated that he has been advised that the Rev Proc does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created before the Rev Proc qualifies for the tax credit He also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service date This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced According to Goldstein the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the Rev Proc When asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date Michael didnt know He has agreed to find this number and get back to me After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev Proc Michael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford sp at VE who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Department about it I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I didnt know if this fellow was one of them He said that he had not talked to Price and had no idea what he would advise Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev Proc would serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to mitigate damages He stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and even moving the second machine back to Virginia When asked what was happening with the machine at Pier IX he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a source of coal for it I told Goldstein that I would visit with the Coal Guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of everything that has happened He said that he didnt think this was going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldnt be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem I suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sure the parties were on the same page about the Production Test coal size etc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a mediation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about November through the date of any deal going forward Please note that I made clear that I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra on this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire I told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was I would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one Finally I told him Id get with you guys and call him later today or tomorrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discussions Please give me call when you get a chance It might be a good idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available
