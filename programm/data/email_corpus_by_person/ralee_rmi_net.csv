Congrats Donnie Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend From what I hear everyone had an awesome time Celeste and I counted weddings we got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly Ill let everyone know about the invite but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town Send me

congratulate you and Celeste Again sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday I hope there are some good stories I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point and you guys had a great time Hopefully you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florvals At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall Also there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC actually Northern VA And to think in my st years all I thought existed was the Westbank There is so much more Thought you might get a kick out of that comment This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nations capitol Its such a better place now that the White Trash that was living in the White House has moved out I know it not as cool as Melancon living blocks from Wrigley but you know The invite holds good not only for Mr Mrs Louis Florval Generes what the hell is that but also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few years Later Val Donnie
