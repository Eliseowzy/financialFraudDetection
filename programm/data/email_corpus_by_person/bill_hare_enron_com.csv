Counterparty to include a division of Cargill Incorporated We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty Bill From Mark Taylor on PM To Bill D ct cc Samuel CT Tana CT Stephanie CT Subject Urgent Counterparty Divisions Cargill Ferrous International Bill If Sams description below of the GCP procedure is correct it looks to me like something needs to be changed The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterpartys name from Global Counterparty Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself That is the source of Tanas concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure please let me know Mark Forwarded by Mark TaylorHOUECT on PM Tana Jones PM To Mark CT cc

our downstream systems GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename Division name or Parent Name not both simultaneously Although we have broken that rule for Legal
