Cupertino CA To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HPs business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the th meeting Matt On November th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enrons trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enrons products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron EBS GSS buy side Peter Goebel On November th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined possible EBSHP focus areas connectivity storage and wireless Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this SarahJoy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity What is HPs time horizon for short term EBS and GSSBD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity completed GSSBD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader set for In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forwardlooking strategy with HPEBS were confirmed Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enrons products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition The coordination between Cashiola short term initiative Morgridge long term months has remained unorganized These initiatives need to be developed separately Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way But Gerrys short term plans will not be the focus of the EBSHP relationship rather a byproduct To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle Lovejoys boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HPs Americas Central Region In the conference call Thursday with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSSBD push for the HPEBS initiative by reiterating the following two points a Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running b HPs ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HPs business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect eServices Solutions met at the meeting in the near term Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities SarahJoy Hunter Enron
