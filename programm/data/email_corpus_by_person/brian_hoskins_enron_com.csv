Online DJ University Publications Library Reprints SmartMoney Workcom Dow Jones Co Corrections Privacy Policy Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires in Chinese November Reforms in India Are Tantalizing But Debates Cool Investor Ardor By DANNY PEARL Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEW DELHI India The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely been turning in India over the past decade each click resonating through this nation of a billion people Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets has seemed a bit brighter but not bright enough to impress foreign investors Every day Indias financial pages are filled with news of a new opening a plan to sell the governments stake in a big car company the lifting of controls on the textile industry But the fine print tells another story stubborn hurdles to foreign investment insistence on public control and open battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic gambles The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis and there is no crisis around the corner says Mahesh Vyas executive director of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy a private organization India is still coasting along with economic growth above a year Still there are some worrisome signs Last month Standard Poors lowered its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic reform Foreign investment already a pittance compared with the rest of Asia has slackened recently and a few big companies including Enron Corp of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC are freezing some India investments as their focus shifts to moredeveloped markets Just of the multinationalcompany executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they were more likely to invest in India than in China said the reverse Even critics think Mr Vajpayees nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government is sincere about pushing for further opening of Indias statist economy But what government officials call the second generation of reforms Indias Congress Party launched the first in the early s to allow more private enterprise is meeting stiff domestic resistance Workers and traditional Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever and the Congress Party now in the opposition is playing on those fears So the government is moving in small often contradictory steps Their hearts are in the right place says John Band executive director of ASK Raymond James an affiliate of the American investment bank Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas Privatization Indias program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk but much of it could come to fruition in the next few months While the government probably wont meet its target of raising billion rupees billion this fiscal year it is likely India will shed some perennial money losers The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart Indian Airlines both of which have attracted expressions of interest from foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines Divestment Minister Arun Shourie who isnt revealing the full list said on the first day of the World Economic Forums India Economic Summit in New Delhi Sunday that before proceeding to formal bids India will reject suitors who could pose nationalsecurity concerns India he said wants to avoid buyers who might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing rights Job padding is legendary in India so fear of job losses is real Bank workers fired a warning shot across privatizations bow this month with a oneday midweek strike against government banks The next day the government announced it was moving forward anyhow seeking a law that would allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below The move wasnt as bold as it seemed though The law wouldnt actually contemplate a sale of shares and wouldnt allow any single investor to buy more than Government officials pledged to keep the public character of the banks Supporters of divestment within Mr Vajpayees cabinet are few but influential They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the governments stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd a joint venture of Japans Suzuki Motor Corp and Indias government But the cabinet is divided over the sale and Mr Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition happy including hardline nationalists This weekend Mr Shourie flew to Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about the prime ministers recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled region of Kashmir One of their demands he says was that Foreigners should not come to acquire control of the Indian economy Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization The World Bank has cited concern that Indias budget deficit is a whopping of its gross domestic product though much of the red ink can be traced to state budgets Mr Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities but thats not even being talked about Media India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign media especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the Kashmir dispute Technology has brought paradoxes Indians now get scores of channels by cable TV but only governmentcontrolled TV over regular antenna Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but cannot print in India The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have made informal efforts to lift the barrier The newly appointed information minister Sushma Swaraj a BJP hardliner this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness At her prodding the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly by satellite but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership Equally worrisome was Ms Swarajs explanation for the governments decision to move forward Before she explained the government had no satellite facility in India now it did and could cut off broadcasts that offend Indias programming code Ms Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web sites too They are bound by this code she said As yet there is no complaint If there is we can take care of it Ms Swaraj started a national debate over whether to lift the restrictions on foreign media days later ended it with a firm no But as one door closes in India another often cracks open Private FM radio is expected to make its debut in the spring The government has also taken steps to help film studios get expansion financing just as Hollywood starts to prowl the Hindi film industry for investments Telecommunications The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of telecommunications and the results may even help build domestic support for other reforms Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service improves In Bombay which once had fiveyear waiting lists for new telephone lines the governments localphone company MTNL now promises even if it doesnt always deliver hookups in two days The reason is new competition from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the countrys booming software and callcenter business relies on fast communications with the US The government only recently loosened its control over international data gateways a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data traffic jams Idika Solutions a software company based in Hyderabad got in the habit of downloading files at am to avoid the rush Further reforms should speed up improvements Next year Parliament is expected to pass a convergence law allowing telephone wireless and data services to come under the same license And the following year government phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on longdistance phone service Trade In theory India a member of the World Trade Organization has no choice but to open its borders to foreign products and so far it is sticking to schedule passing a new patents law and so forth But rather than investing to get ready for free competition many business families are simply getting out of manufacturing Their worry isnt so much luxury goods from the West which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the spring but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia The government is starting to heed the call for more protection Last week it raised duties on cooking oil and listed imported products that would have to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as textiles for a world without quotas Still the industry is so thoroughly regulated that it is hard to see Indias mild reforms having much effect For example the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move into certain products that were reserved for small companies but it still requires yarnspinners to produce of their yarn in a form that can be used by obsolete hand looms With certain fabrics if I produce it on a power loom Im breaking the law says Ramesh Chander Kesar president of the Textile Association India in New Delhi Why should there should be a restriction The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian workers and the government is loath to throw them out on the street Actually even when mills close as many have in central Bombay mill owners often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of the land If we can fire a worker for not working that will send a powerful signal But there are no votes in it says Gurchuran Das former Procter Gamble chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party Nobody has the courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain NAFTA that jobs will be lost but in the end jobs will be created Some less courageous moves are possible one idea under discussion in New Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily Finance India made some big financial reforms in the early s with liberalization of interest rates loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of private banking The country just needs some more money to prime the system The government is approving new financial products such as derivatives The big prize investment bankers say would be opening of the governmentcontrolled mutual fund and pension plans Right now they offer fixed returns Private investment companies want the government to let them offer Indians moreaggressive private pensions They are listening says Raju Panjwani managing director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter India Maybe equities are considered risky but we cant even invest in corporate bonds The government has a plan under study called Project Oasis that would allow private pension fund management with some restrictions Another possible source of longterm capital is insurance something there isnt much of in India The government took a big step last year in allowing private insurance companies back into India after nearly years But as the race to start marketing policies begins only half a dozen companies have jumped in Foreign companies are limited to of each insurance partnership That is a problem because launching an insurance company can take million and there are not that many Indian companies that can support of that kind of a number says Gary Benanav chief executive of New York Life Insurance Cos international unit The company which is launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian conglomerate estimates the Indian market could support insurance competitors Theyve made a decision which I dont think in the long run is in the best interests of India though I understand it The colonial era has left a few wounds here Mr Benanav says Write to Danny Pearl at Brian T Hoskins Enron Broadband Services office mobile fax

Online DJ University Publications Library Reprints SmartMoney Workcom Dow Jones Co Corrections Privacy Policy Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires in Chinese November Reforms in India Are Tantalizing But Debates Cool Investor Ardor By DANNY PEARL Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEW DELHI India The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely been turning in India over the past decade each click resonating through this nation of a billion people Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets has seemed a bit brighter but not bright enough to impress foreign investors Every day Indias financial pages are filled with news of a new opening a plan to sell the governments stake in a big car company the lifting of controls on the textile industry But the fine print tells another story stubborn hurdles to foreign investment insistence on public control and open battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic gambles The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis and there is no crisis around the corner says Mahesh Vyas executive director of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy a private organization India is still coasting along with economic growth above a year Still there are some worrisome signs Last month Standard Poors lowered its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic reform Foreign investment already a pittance compared with the rest of Asia has slackened recently and a few big companies including Enron Corp of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC are freezing some India investments as their focus shifts to moredeveloped markets Just of the multinationalcompany executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they were more likely to invest in India than in China said the reverse Even critics think Mr Vajpayees nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government is sincere about pushing for further opening of Indias statist economy But what government officials call the second generation of reforms Indias Congress Party launched the first in the early s to allow more private enterprise is meeting stiff domestic resistance Workers and traditional Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever and the Congress Party now in the opposition is playing on those fears So the government is moving in small often contradictory steps Their hearts are in the right place says John Band executive director of ASK Raymond James an affiliate of the American investment bank Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas Privatization Indias program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk but much of it could come to fruition in the next few months While the government probably wont meet its target of raising billion rupees billion this fiscal year it is likely India will shed some perennial money losers The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart Indian Airlines both of which have attracted expressions of interest from foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines Divestment Minister Arun Shourie who isnt revealing the full list said on the first day of the World Economic Forums India Economic Summit in New Delhi Sunday that before proceeding to formal bids India will reject suitors who could pose nationalsecurity concerns India he said wants to avoid buyers who might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing rights Job padding is legendary in India so fear of job losses is real Bank workers fired a warning shot across privatizations bow this month with a oneday midweek strike against government banks The next day the government announced it was moving forward anyhow seeking a law that would allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below The move wasnt as bold as it seemed though The law wouldnt actually contemplate a sale of shares and wouldnt allow any single investor to buy more than Government officials pledged to keep the public character of the banks Supporters of divestment within Mr Vajpayees cabinet are few but influential They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the governments stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd a joint venture of Japans Suzuki Motor Corp and Indias government But the cabinet is divided over the sale and Mr Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition happy including hardline nationalists This weekend Mr Shourie flew to Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about the prime ministers recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled region of Kashmir One of their demands he says was that Foreigners should not come to acquire control of the Indian economy Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization The World Bank has cited concern that Indias budget deficit is a whopping of its gross domestic product though much of the red ink can be traced to state budgets Mr Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities but thats not even being talked about Media India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign media especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the Kashmir dispute Technology has brought paradoxes Indians now get scores of channels by cable TV but only governmentcontrolled TV over regular antenna Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but cannot print in India The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have made informal efforts to lift the barrier The newly appointed information minister Sushma Swaraj a BJP hardliner this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness At her prodding the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly by satellite but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership Equally worrisome was Ms Swarajs explanation for the governments decision to move forward Before she explained the government had no satellite facility in India now it did and could cut off broadcasts that offend Indias programming code Ms Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web sites too They are bound by this code she said As yet there is no complaint If there is we can take care of it Ms Swaraj started a national debate over whether to lift the restrictions on foreign media days later ended it with a firm no But as one door closes in India another often cracks open Private FM radio is expected to make its debut in the spring The government has also taken steps to help film studios get expansion financing just as Hollywood starts to prowl the Hindi film industry for investments Telecommunications The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of telecommunications and the results may even help build domestic support for other reforms Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service improves In Bombay which once had fiveyear waiting lists for new telephone lines the governments localphone company MTNL now promises even if it doesnt always deliver hookups in two days The reason is new competition from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the countrys booming software and callcenter business relies on fast communications with the US The government only recently loosened its control over international data gateways a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data traffic jams Idika Solutions a software company based in Hyderabad got in the habit of downloading files at am to avoid the rush Further reforms should speed up improvements Next year Parliament is expected to pass a convergence law allowing telephone wireless and data services to come under the same license And the following year government phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on longdistance phone service Trade In theory India a member of the World Trade Organization has no choice but to open its borders to foreign products and so far it is sticking to schedule passing a new patents law and so forth But rather than investing to get ready for free competition many business families are simply getting out of manufacturing Their worry isnt so much luxury goods from the West which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the spring but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia The government is starting to heed the call for more protection Last week it raised duties on cooking oil and listed imported products that would have to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as textiles for a world without quotas Still the industry is so thoroughly regulated that it is hard to see Indias mild reforms having much effect For example the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move into certain products that were reserved for small companies but it still requires yarnspinners to produce of their yarn in a form that can be used by obsolete hand looms With certain fabrics if I produce it on a power loom Im breaking the law says Ramesh Chander Kesar president of the Textile Association India in New Delhi Why should there should be a restriction The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian workers and the government is loath to throw them out on the street Actually even when mills close as many have in central Bombay mill owners often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of the land If we can fire a worker for not working that will send a powerful signal But there are no votes in it says Gurchuran Das former Procter Gamble chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party Nobody has the courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain NAFTA that jobs will be lost but in the end jobs will be created Some less courageous moves are possible one idea under discussion in New Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily Finance India made some big financial reforms in the early s with liberalization of interest rates loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of private banking The country just needs some more money to prime the system The government is approving new financial products such as derivatives The big prize investment bankers say would be opening of the governmentcontrolled mutual fund and pension plans Right now they offer fixed returns Private investment companies want the government to let them offer Indians moreaggressive private pensions They are listening says Raju Panjwani managing director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter India Maybe equities are considered risky but we cant even invest in corporate bonds The government has a plan under study called Project Oasis that would allow private pension fund management with some restrictions Another possible source of longterm capital is insurance something there isnt much of in India The government took a big step last year in allowing private insurance companies back into India after nearly years But as the race to start marketing policies begins only half a dozen companies have jumped in Foreign companies are limited to of each insurance partnership That is a problem because launching an insurance company can take million and there are not that many Indian companies that can support of that kind of a number says Gary Benanav chief executive of New York Life Insurance Cos international unit The company which is launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian conglomerate estimates the Indian market could support insurance competitors Theyve made a decision which I dont think in the long run is in the best interests of India though I understand it The colonial era has left a few wounds here Mr Benanav says Write to Danny Pearl at Brian T Hoskins Enron Broadband Services office mobile fax

Online DJ University Publications Library Reprints SmartMoney Workcom Dow Jones Co Corrections Privacy Policy Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires in Chinese November Reforms in India Are Tantalizing But Debates Cool Investor Ardor By DANNY PEARL Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEW DELHI India The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely been turning in India over the past decade each click resonating through this nation of a billion people Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets has seemed a bit brighter but not bright enough to impress foreign investors Every day Indias financial pages are filled with news of a new opening a plan to sell the governments stake in a big car company the lifting of controls on the textile industry But the fine print tells another story stubborn hurdles to foreign investment insistence on public control and open battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic gambles The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis and there is no crisis around the corner says Mahesh Vyas executive director of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy a private organization India is still coasting along with economic growth above a year Still there are some worrisome signs Last month Standard Poors lowered its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic reform Foreign investment already a pittance compared with the rest of Asia has slackened recently and a few big companies including Enron Corp of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC are freezing some India investments as their focus shifts to moredeveloped markets Just of the multinationalcompany executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they were more likely to invest in India than in China said the reverse Even critics think Mr Vajpayees nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party which one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government is sincere about pushing for further opening of Indias statist economy But what government officials call the second generation of reforms Indias Congress Party launched the first in the early s to allow more private enterprise is meeting stiff domestic resistance Workers and traditional Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever and the Congress Party now in the opposition is playing on those fears So the government is moving in small often contradictory steps Their hearts are in the right place says John Band executive director of ASK Raymond James an affiliate of the American investment bank Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas Privatization Indias program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk but much of it could come to fruition in the next few months While the government probably wont meet its target of raising billion rupees billion this fiscal year it is likely India will shed some perennial money losers The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart Indian Airlines both of which have attracted expressions of interest from foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines Divestment Minister Arun Shourie who isnt revealing the full list said on the first day of the World Economic Forums India Economic Summit in New Delhi Sunday that before proceeding to formal bids India will reject suitors who could pose nationalsecurity concerns India he said wants to avoid buyers who might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing rights Job padding is legendary in India so fear of job losses is real Bank workers fired a warning shot across privatizations bow this month with a oneday midweek strike against government banks The next day the government announced it was moving forward anyhow seeking a law that would allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below The move wasnt as bold as it seemed though The law wouldnt actually contemplate a sale of shares and wouldnt allow any single investor to buy more than Government officials pledged to keep the public character of the banks Supporters of divestment within Mr Vajpayees cabinet are few but influential They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the governments stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd a joint venture of Japans Suzuki Motor Corp and Indias government But the cabinet is divided over the sale and Mr Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition happy including hardline nationalists This weekend Mr Shourie flew to Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about the prime ministers recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled region of Kashmir One of their demands he says was that Foreigners should not come to acquire control of the Indian economy Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization The World Bank has cited concern that Indias budget deficit is a whopping of its gross domestic product though much of the red ink can be traced to state budgets Mr Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities but thats not even being talked about Media India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign media especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the Kashmir dispute Technology has brought paradoxes Indians now get scores of channels by cable TV but only governmentcontrolled TV over regular antenna Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but cannot print in India The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have made informal efforts to lift the barrier The newly appointed information minister Sushma Swaraj a BJP hardliner this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness At her prodding the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly by satellite but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership Equally worrisome was Ms Swarajs explanation for the governments decision to move forward Before she explained the government had no satellite facility in India now it did and could cut off broadcasts that offend Indias programming code Ms Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web sites too They are bound by this code she said As yet there is no complaint If there is we can take care of it Ms Swaraj started a national debate over whether to lift the restrictions on foreign media days later ended it with a firm no But as one door closes in India another often cracks open Private FM radio is expected to make its debut in the spring The government has also taken steps to help film studios get expansion financing just as Hollywood starts to prowl the Hindi film industry for investments Telecommunications The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of telecommunications and the results may even help build domestic support for other reforms Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service improves In Bombay which once had fiveyear waiting lists for new telephone lines the governments localphone company MTNL now promises even if it doesnt always deliver hookups in two days The reason is new competition from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the countrys booming software and callcenter business relies on fast communications with the US The government only recently loosened its control over international data gateways a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data traffic jams Idika Solutions a software company based in Hyderabad got in the habit of downloading files at am to avoid the rush Further reforms should speed up improvements Next year Parliament is expected to pass a convergence law allowing telephone wireless and data services to come under the same license And the following year government phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on longdistance phone service Trade In theory India a member of the World Trade Organization has no choice but to open its borders to foreign products and so far it is sticking to schedule passing a new patents law and so forth But rather than investing to get ready for free competition many business families are simply getting out of manufacturing Their worry isnt so much luxury goods from the West which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the spring but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia The government is starting to heed the call for more protection Last week it raised duties on cooking oil and listed imported products that would have to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as textiles for a world without quotas Still the industry is so thoroughly regulated that it is hard to see Indias mild reforms having much effect For example the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move into certain products that were reserved for small companies but it still requires yarnspinners to produce of their yarn in a form that can be used by obsolete hand looms With certain fabrics if I produce it on a power loom Im breaking the law says Ramesh Chander Kesar president of the Textile Association India in New Delhi Why should there should be a restriction The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian workers and the government is loath to throw them out on the street Actually even when mills close as many have in central Bombay mill owners often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of the land If we can fire a worker for not working that will send a powerful signal But there are no votes in it says Gurchuran Das former Procter Gamble chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party Nobody has the courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain NAFTA that jobs will be lost but in the end jobs will be created Some less courageous moves are possible one idea under discussion in New Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily Finance India made some big financial reforms in the early s with liberalization of interest rates loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of private banking The country just needs some more money to prime the system The government is approving new financial products such as derivatives The big prize investment bankers say would be opening of the governmentcontrolled mutual fund and pension plans Right now they offer fixed returns Private investment companies want the government to let them offer Indians moreaggressive private pensions They are listening says Raju Panjwani managing director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter India Maybe equities are considered risky but we cant even invest in corporate bonds The government has a plan under study called Project Oasis that would allow private pension fund management with some restrictions Another possible source of longterm capital is insurance something there isnt much of in India The government took a big step last year in allowing private insurance companies back into India after nearly years But as the race to start marketing policies begins only half a dozen companies have jumped in Foreign companies are limited to of each insurance partnership That is a problem because launching an insurance company can take million and there are not that many Indian companies that can support of that kind of a number says Gary Benanav chief executive of New York Life Insurance Cos international unit The company which is launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian conglomerate estimates the Indian market could support insurance competitors Theyve made a decision which I dont think in the long run is in the best
