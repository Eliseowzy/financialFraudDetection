Teesside was completed in only twothirds the time The company declines to compare development times in various countries I wouldnt necessarily put Poland into the same category as Russia says Philip Davies regulatory and governmentaffairs manager at Enron Europe in London But obviously given Polands planned economy past it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process and get

companies and the Polish Power Grid a kilometer national transmission network of highvoltage lines The assets have a total book value of billion zlotys billion euros but murky regulations have driven prices down The regulations dont promote competition and so you dont really know the price of electricity says Bengt Wegemo president of Vattenfall Poland Earlier this year Vattenfall paid million for in Warsawbased Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie promising million in investment in the heatandpower plant over the next years Investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing Ultimately licensed energy traders and large power users will trade on the bourse setting the wholesale price of electricity The Polish bourse will be modeled on its Nordic counterpart Enron the Nord Pools largest trader hopes to post Polish trading profits by But first say market experts Polands energy law must be amended to ease functioning of the bourse and free up access to Polands distribution network Further the government says it must solve the competition problem posed by the Polish Power Grids powerpurchase agreements which account for of energy sales in Poland Some stateowned plants used the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing When prices are freed these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete with plants that didnt spend money to modernize The government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the modernized plants for their extra costs Though Nowa Sarzyna is a private plant the price Enron must charge for its power is about twice what outmoded plants charge We are hoping that continuous efficient operation of the plant will generate us a bigger profit Mr Astramowicz says Another problem is crossborder power trading where contradictory legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the Polish Power Grid also known as PSE Enron and others protest that PSE shouldnt compete with electricitymarket participants who contract with it for transmission service PSE intends to stay in the trading business says Marek Zerka PSEs vice president In late March PSE and local company Kulczyk Holding signed an agreement with PreussenElektra AG of Germany to export electricity and coal to EU countries via Germany This is great news Mr Astramowicz says If this joint venture gets access to PSEs crossborder transmission capacity I would expect PSE to confirm open access to all market participants Enron and others are pushing hard for that access As soon as the market becomes open free and nondiscriminatory we will come out at a decent profit Mr Astramowicz says Folder Name Enron in Europe Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by email at or by
