about Words and Languages From Hans Feuss Subject Re AWordADayaufklarung I am now years of age but during my youth the word aufklaerung note the umlaut here had a very specific meaning Having received aufklaerung or having been aufgeklaert ALWAYS meant that your parentselders etc have told you not necessarily taught you the ways of the birds and bees and how babies were made I suppose this is a form of enlightenment but not necessarily in the way it was presented Also noted by Pamela MatsudaDunn and Raul Cucalon From Quincy Liu Subject Anschluss Before the word Anschluss became encrusted with the political overtone of being taken over it had and still has the straight forward meaning of having connection to eg by knowing a certain contact person one has the Anschluss to an organization or a group From Eric Wilson Subject Succinct definition of kitsch Some years back on a BBC radio program called My Work I heard the most succinct definition of kitsch kitsch A Venus de Milo statue with a clock its belly Says it all dont you agree From Randall Gray Subject AWordADaykitsch We were discussing what someone ought to wear to a moderately formal function when a voice from the rabble piped up Remember Kitsch never goes out of style It is now on the wall in our loo along with a motley collection of other similar aphorisms both humourous and wise From Gretta Small Subject Spelling Why have you chosen to OMIT the umlaut in gemutlichkeit your spelling rather than to observe the convention using an e following the oughttobe umlauted character to indicate the umlaut normally observed when the umlauted character is not available on the keyboard This is done even in Germany Thus the word would be spelled Gemuetlichkeit The umlauted u has a completely different pronunciation from the nonumlauted u and thus is absolutely essential I lived in Germany for many years and learned this the hard way eg schwuel WITH the umlaut means humid and schwul means homosexual From Rudolph Chelminski Subject Re German words I have received a multitude of complaints that the German words I selected for AWAD as a Guest Wordsmith were missing umlauts and were not capitalized as is standard German practice for nouns Two explanations for this Many most American keyboards mine included do not have the umlaut symbol and once German or Hindi or Afghan or whatever words have been kidnapped into our language they are no longer what they were Now that we have them in captivity they have to play by OUR rules hehhehheh So no accents umlauts diacritical marks or whatever And no capitalizations From Mark Willis Subject Fifteen minutes of fame for chad Ive been enjoying your AWAD mailings for over a year now and every once in awhile I see in print a word I had recently learned from the daily morsels you send But I doubt if any newlylearned word so far has appeared as prominently to me as the term chad AWAD For the past six days the election of the president in the United States has been literally and figuratively hinging on the chads attached in various conditions to the manuallypunched ballots in the state of Florida as election officials examine them for hints of the voters electoral intent When I originally saw chad on your list I wondered why we needed a name for such an item Now I realize that every word will have its fifteen minutes of fame Whenever I see or hear the word which the news media often stop to define before proceeding with the story I think of AWAD Thank you for doing your part to inform our electoral process here in the United States For those who missed it first time around the word chad is available at wordschadhtml If you wish to see the theme under which it appeared and the entire weeks words check out the archives for Nov at awadarchiveshtml Anu From Brian West Subject Slang I have with much interest read the correspondence on English rhyming slang This reminds me of an alternative slang used on occasion by my late Father and allegedly by Butchers in England where words were reversed thus eson was nose ecaf esaf was face and so forth Quite difficult to understand until acquainted with the rules From Suzy Subject speaking backwards Since most people who subscribe to AWAD are linguaphiles I would expect that many have a facility with languages in general Im wondering how common the ability to speak backwards is For example one could instantly translate while speaking Hello my name is John into Olleh ym eman si Nhoj I can do it and Ive only met one other person who could do it as well Is this a fairly common ability I tnod kniht os Una Dictionary Spell binder Joseph F Morris Send your comments about words to AWADmail archives are available at awadawadmailhtml To get them by

about Words and Languages From Monica Clements Subject ocker Seeing the word ocker reminds me of a story told by a friend It took place during the Australian air traffic controllers strike of the s when interstate travellers were desperate for any form of airborne transport and all the light planes were full My friends father was one of the people who tried to hitch a ride on a light plane He rushed up to the stewardabout to close the plane doors and asked breathlessly whether there was any room only to be answered with the immortal line Sorry ocker the Fokkers chocker From Sam Robinson Subject Ocker Id thought that the word ocker had been around since before TV and it turned out I was only partly wrong According to the Australian National Universitys web site ANDCAustwordsockerhtml and how could you disagree with a source named ANU Ocker has a longer history as a nickname in Australia for anyone with the personal name Oscar or Horace or with the surname Stevens just as Blue is the nickname often given to people with red hair Id wager that the character in the Mavis Bramston Show was known by a nickname because a bloke like Ocker would hardly ever be known by his real name especially if it was Horace From D McCulloch Subject Re AWordADaydauphin Never occurred to me before this the heir to the French throne was the dolphin while the heir to the British is the Prince of Whales Nothing fishy at all about that mammally perhaps From Kevin Purcell Subject Diverging Languages UK Ill give you a ring US Ill call you UK The number is engaged US The number is busy Of course this leads to some interesting puns in British English that dont work in US English Ill give you a ring unless your engaged has two meanings in UK English but only one in US English From Jane Hope Subject English vs American I was married to an Englishman during the s I had no idea what he wanted when he asked for a bobbin of cotton He meant a spool of thread Also at first he would promise to knock me up in the morning which he thought meant he would come by to wake me up From William Youmans Subject variations of English This discussion regarding the different meanings of American English and English English reminds me of an experience in a London restaurant several years ago I was in the company of my wife and two middle aged American ladies Upon the completion of our very good meal In England yet one of the ladies in a loud voice stated I feel really stuffed Upon observing amused glances from our fellow diners perhaps imaginary on my part I suggested to her that being stuffed in England had a much different connotation than being satiated with food From Jennifer Reibel Subject pronunciation Many years ago while living as an American houseguest in the north of England my host offered to take me to the lakeshore This confused me since there was no lake nearby and my hosts didnt drive a car Instead we walked downtown to a ramshackle building and walked up three flights of stairs to a leek show The British are fanatical gardeners and love to show off their talents Also on display were tomatoes onions and many kinds of flowers But the event was known throughout the community as the leek show From Nathaniel G Higgs Subject Language is changing Just as British English differs from American English I find this true with other languages too In Spain a car is called a coche and a coach or cart is called a carro In the Americas a car is called a carro and a coach is called a coche There are several other words that have opposite and different meanings depending upon the country yet they all speak Spanish Language is changing constantly and those changes do not always occur concurrently within the global community From Kathryn Flueck Subject Re British English Is it too late to comment about differences between American and British English I have seen nothing on one of the most colorful aspects of British English Cockney rhyming slang perhaps because it is considered somewhat lower class although it has been around for more than a hundred years and some of the terms have crept into more common usage clearly no pun intended The theory is it was started as a code language The idea was to use a phrase usually two words the second of which rhymes with the word one wants to use then often the rhyming word is dropped off making the statement impossible to understand unless one knows the term Thus apples and pears rhymes with stairs so if one asks where a particular room or thing is one might be told it is up the apples Use your loaf means Use your head for loaf of bread rhymes with head Once I fixed scrambled eggs for some Cockney friends and was asked if I had any rocking horse I was at a total loss of course Turned out they were asking for ketchup which the English call sauce and in Cockney English horse and sauce rhyme hoase and soace For those interested I highly recommend the book Cockney Rabbit by Ray Puxley Rabbit stands for talk The phrase is rabbit and pork and in Cockney English pork and talk rhyme poke and toke From Kovacs Istvan Subject Palindromes I know its not the current topic and its related to computer languages just as strongly as to English still I thought maybe youd appreciate this Theres a contest for abusing the C programming language the International Obfuscated C Code Contest wwwiocccorg One of my favourite people who regularly participate is Brian Westley One of his programs is completely symmetric each line is a palindrome westleyc Maybe you think this has nothing to do with English Maybe thisll help you change your mind westleyc From Anthony Stevens Subject AWADmail issue Do all recipients of AWAD appreciate the forum available to exchange comments and chat in this more interactive manner on the discussion board of the site Men women and fish from all over the world are represented so all are made welcome Take a look at board From Susan Lubell Subject sigh My friend

Tidbits about Words and Languages From Anu Garg Subject AWADnews Latest issue of AWADnews is now available It includes list demographics stats shortest longest email addresses etc newest countries on the list and other regular features awadawadnewshtml From Rebecca Ewing Subject blue rinse Theres a good reason for blue rinse As we age a yellow film develops over the eye making colors look dull and muted This is why the stereotypical old opera goer will wear bright red rouge and lipstick and a loud dress To her eye the red makeup looks pink White or gray hair will look brassy to her eye With a blue rinse the hair looks silver or white instead One older client phoned me after cataract surgery Shed always thought her appliances were almond when in fact they were white From Jane Ross Subject Bluenose In Canada the word bluenose has a very positive meaning Our internationally acclaimed Bluenose is the clipper ship that adorns our cent piece our dime She was an international racing ship and she won every race she sailed She hails from Halifax and consequently those who live in Halifax are called Bluenosers aside from being called Haligonians From Sherilyn Lee Subject Regarding Blue Rinse While flying to Ireland this summer I sat next to a man from Cork I asked him for some suggestions of places to visit and we struck up a conversation Upon my mentioning some wellknown Irish tourist attraction his eyes sparkled as he said You dont want to go there its been washed with the Blue Rinse You want something authentic It turns out that something in Ireland that has been washed with the Blue Rinse means that it has been completely Americanized From M Sorensen Subject Re Blue With your clever samples demonstrating the various meaning in words and phrases using the color blue you suggest Even a computer would go crazy trying to make sense of this I found this especially amusing being a computer geek by trade Ever since the early days of Windows when the operating system crashes goes crazy trying to make sense of things it displays only a simple text error message in white lettering on a blue background This condition is almost always fatal meaning that the system must be restarted When this occurs we say that the system bluescreened or displayed the Blue Screen Of Death or BSOD The term is so prevalent in the industry that Microsofts Knowledge Base uses bluescreen as a common search keyword From Tandy Solomon Subject Re blue rinse In American English these folks are generally known as blue hairs The theatre community uses the phrase to denote the type of audience typically found at matinee performances How will that scene play with the blue hairs is a common query Meanwhile among those who wait tables the blue hairs are rightly or wrongly thought to be the worst tippers No one wants to take a table of blue hairs Speaking of the waiting profession in the late s we came to be gendernonspecifically called waitrons which was phased out in favor of the current servers From Carolyn Bryant Subject AWordADayblue rinse Perhaps its just the circle I run in but Ive always used the phrase blue hairs to speak of elderly women Not all elderly women but the type that drive at slow speeds with one blinker flashing and need a booster seat to see past the steering wheel or those that count out pennies at the cashier when theres a huge line up behind them The groovier ones are Old Girls I hope to be an Old Girl myself one day From Joe Mulholland Subject blue rinse And in Brazil when youre feeling blue it means everythings great tudo azul From Grizelda Subject headline PS Reading through the AWAD bulletin reminds me of a headline from the Eastern Daily Press a wonderfully laconic newspaper which serves East Anglia a mainly rural area whose villages have quaint names deriving from very early English A lot of these villagenames end in ing an interesting area of discussion for AngloSaxon historians and placename experts The headline was in the Recent Weddings section Little Snoring Man Marries Seething Woman From Vicky Tarulis Subject Whats the opposite This morning at breakfast while watching Good Morning America my husband noticed that Dr Tim Johnson was pronouncing antibiotic antibotic dropping a syllable We learned from AWAD that an epenthesis is when a person adds a syllable to a word My husband would like to know what is the word for when a person drops a syllable The word is haplology A good example is aluminium which in the US is known as aluminum It all depends which side of the pond one happened to be on Britons accuse Americans of haplology while the latter believe it is the former who are committing epenthesis Im partial to aluminium it conforms to others such as potassium and magnesium Anu From Jim Bofenkamp Subject Blue rinse definition You have spelled gray with an e Gray is American usage grey is British usage Since you use color instead of colour in the same entry I am assuming that these entries are supposed to reflect current and correct American usage Just thought you might want to know Yes my roots are showing I was born and raised in India spelling words as colour aluminium etc After moving to the US my spelling has undergone change but the traces remain I still have a bias for learnt instead of learned for example While we are on this topic I understand the effect of US English is spreading even on people who dont live in the US According to a report more British children spell color rather than colour now How are things in other countries Drop us a line Anu From Bob Burr Subject Glad were not a black and white world Blue may be a wishy washy color in our language but black and white are not In our subtly racist mother tongue nearly every thing associated with white is good while to an even greater degree nearly everything associated with black is bad Black hat blackhearted blackball blackmail black cat crossing our paths etc I wish black and white were as confusing as blue From LJ Subject Re AWordADaybrown study Certainly every language has its own way of using concrete colors to express abstract concepts No less so Mandarin Chinese To refer to something as the Blue Root means its the original work or the source on which other works are based You can informally refer to a young lady as a Yellow Flower Girl identifying her as a maiden or a virgin But if the book youre reading or the movie youre watching is Yellow then that means its obscene even pornographic A fellows wife might enjoy thinking back over the Pink Memories of their courtship days ie romantic memories but if on the other hand hes Wearing a Green Hat then that means shes been very seriously cheating on him A Black Man is an unregistered resident and if the local officials are taking in Gray Income then theyve been accepting money under the table No doubt the color red is paramount to the Chinese in both ancient and modern history The last generation sang of their great leader The sun is crimson red and Chairman Mao is most beloved and to be RedHearted was to be fully devoted to the revolution Red also from ancient times has denoted among other things honor and favor such as when you give an esteemed older friend or teacher a red envelope for Chinese New Year which contains gift money In a similar way if a boss gives a favored employee the Red Envelope then that person is getting a special bonus and may even be called Red Man by his coworkers indicating the preferential treatment hes receiving And if your name shows up on the Red Board that means you made the honor roll But beware of a disgruntled acquaintance telling you that hes going to give you some color to look at Thats the Chinese way of saying Im going to teach you a thing or two From Maria Victoria Go Subject Re blue rinse This colorful metaphor to refer to a specific group of people reminded me of a localregional Philippines phrase circa late s s The phrase is blue seal referring in general to an American or anything made in or imported from the USA Also used to refer to contrabandsmuggled merchandise from the US bases Subic Clark The origin of the phrase is the blue bandseal on cigarette packs from the United States People used the actual phrase blue seal even when they were speaking in any of the dialectslanguages not just in English It was commonly used in an admiring sense infrequently as a derogatory term From Doug Greenwood Subject Brown Study I was delighted to see brown study show up yesterday as the word of the day which immediately triggered thoughts of my first encounter with the term in grad school at Chapel Hill in Louis D Rubins course on Literature of the South The terms so central to John Crowe Ransoms Bells for John Whitesides Daughter that Ive never forgotten itor the poemwhich begins There was such speed in her little body And lightness in her footfall It is no wonder her brown study Astonishes us all Brown study appears again in the last stanza But now go the bells and we are ready In one house we are sternly stopped To say we are vexed at her brown study Lying so primly propped As the father now long after finishing my PhD in American literature of a tenyearold daughter and a sixyearold son I can tell you that I have played with them on many occasions and watched them run and yell and jump in the backyard on many more and have been thrust backsternlymore than once into the innate poignancy of that poem From Eve Sander Subject Re AWADmail Headlines One of my favorite headlines A travel agency was being sued for failing to deliver on advertised features of a group junket to Ireland Tour Allure a Lie Of the unintentional kind in teaching Japanese businessmen how to decode English headlines my alltime fave is British Left Waffles on Falklands Islands I always picture British soldiers carefully laying down lines of crisp waffles step by step as they walk backwards toward troopships in the harbor Of course

Refer wordssockdolagerhtml I commend your choice of the word sockdolager and its unique place in American history but I have to differ with you on your history Booth fired his gun at that precise moment to muffle the loud noise of his shot with the guffaws from the audience and quietly escaped That certainly was his plan but it didnt work out that way Mary Lincoln shrieked when Abe slumped over with blood on his head and Booth struggled briefly with Major Rathbone slashing him badly with the big knife he was also carrying Then Booth attempted to vault from the Presidential box to the stage He was an accomplished athlete and might have made the foot jump had not his spur caught on the bunting around the railing He landed askew on one foot and broke his ankle which did not prevent him from hobbling off in the confusion while shouting something that is most often reported as Sic semper tyrannis Thus with all tyrants the state motto of Virginia Incidentally Booths broken leg was treated by Dr Samuel Mudd who was later probably wrongly accused of being one of the assassination conspirators and exiled to the Dry Tortugas Because of his heroic actions during a yellow fever epidemic there a few years later he was pardoned but his name gave rise to another American colloquialism Your name is mud Thanks for your correction on Booths quiet escape That was quite an escape

that the birthdays of Lincoln and Washington were officially separate until only Washingtons birthday was a federal holiday and only Washingtons birthday was a bank holiday in most states The move to have all official holidays be observed on Mondays to provide threeday weekends pleasant as the results are for all of is was primarily the result of very heavy lobbying of Congress by the hotel and

Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages From Anu Garg Subject Interesting stories from the net Your responses Oxford Dictionary of Weird and Wonderful Words released newsnationworldworldlaoctstory Mad about Scrabble newsspectrumspectrumhtml Bowdlerizing software newstextnationalhtml In the last issue of AWADmail I invited comments from linguaphiles on the state of American Englishs prevalence in their countries Here is a crosssection of responses From EM Fotheringham Subject EnglishAmerican words meanings Not only spelling but also meaning of words has changed recently here in the UK For example presently has always meant in a little while later on but increasingly it has come to mean now at this moment as in presently house prices are rising Confusing to those of an older generation From Robert Elliott Subject colourcolor With regard to your request for comments on US vs international spelling Ive found that the greatest influence of US spelling comes in the world of programming especially HTML colour isnt accepted as a keyword Ive also found it prudent to place humor as well as humour in my web pages keywords Even going back to the days before the web though a program is what one wrote on the computer while a programme is what was on television From Natalia M Subject Re AWADmail Issue Oh of course tonite neighbor color dialog we in Russia perceive them as iniquitous mistakes that only Americans can make Those who have been to the US and lived there might use this variant but not academically eg on a test it would be a serious mistake The younger yo generation of teachers though shows tendencies to accept both variants From Andrew Lisec Subject English Abroad Having taught English in Hungary for seven years I recently returned to the States I witnessed something of a sea change in English usage there In when I arrived in Budapest British English was the standard and Hungarians with good English generally used British spelling syntax and pronunciation The state language examination board was also biased towards British English in some cases including a few of my own students penalizing candidates who used Americanisms By the time I left however the tables had largely turned with American English becoming increasingly the standard in language schools and in the business world Even the hidebound state examination board now makes provision if reluctantly for the colonial version of English in its oral exam From Jonathan Danilowitz Subject BritishAmerican English I was born and brought up in South Africa but have lived in Israel for years At first the Jerusalem Post newspaper followed BritishEnglish usage but some years ago made a formal change to AmericanEnglish It was hard to read for a time Today USstyle English prevails here no doubt because of the change made at the dominant Englishlanguage newspaper and aided by the pervasive US TV influence From Ian Douglas Subject AWADmail Issue Bad and getting worse Not just spelling as much as Americanisms From news bulletins on the radio one hundred twenty instead of one hundred and twenty they will meet Tuesday instead of they will meet on Tuesday And the horrendous in back of instead of behind From a radio ad exhorting us to take part in the current census fill out your form instead of fill in your form Also particularly American words popping up like arraigned which has never been used in SA Same goes for pleabargain which is being introduced here in SA From Kathy Sham Subject American English outside the USA A couple of thoughts from South Africa where for a long time we were exposed to a relentless diet of almost exclusively American TV programmes thanks to the Equity ban during the apartheid years As a result weve embraced US culture dress attitudes and language to an enormous extent Would you believe weve even forgotten how to pronounce apartheid using the USGerman form so that it rhymes with height whereas it should rhyme appropriately enough with hate From Warwick Allen Subject Americanisms in other countries I live in New Zealand and am conscious of the many Americanisms that have entered our version of English Some common examples are using gas for petrol saying a date as November one or November first for example instead of first of November when its written people still use the form DDMMYY and pronouncing z as zee rather than zed Dropping the ue from analogue seems to be almost universal Using good as an adverb in place of well is extremely common I think this might just be a result of grammar having not been taught in schools here for a generation From Alessandra Ricci Subject Issue US spelling in Italy On the subject of US spelling in Italy whenever we use the word center for adverts sport centers shopping centers we do it with the US spelling I think because its more similar to Italian and I think for the same reason we use color as in the famous United colors of Benetton From Gareth Barlow Subject Re American spelling Ive worked as an editor for a newspaper and while South African spelling is meant to be equivalent to British spelling of the articles submitted to us used American spelling much to my dismay yes we had to change all the occurrences of incorrect spelling Whats more those people I have mentioned this fact to often reply along the lines of So what What difference does it make From Onward Lam Subject Re UK vs US spellings Similar to yourself I have spent a good part of adult life in both places using predominantly USEnglish or UKEnglish spelling Though using mostly the UK version I have nevertheless on occasion been required to use the US variant to avoid being penalised One of these variants that I will probably never adopt or get used to is the use of the letter z instead of s in the verb form ize and ise My only rationale for this predicament is the Americans strong desire to win at Scrabble a Z scores versus only for an S From Melanie Sheridan Subject US English Here in Melbourne Australia the official spelling favours the inclusion of the letter u in words such as colour favour neighbour Our daily newspaper The Age and I understand all other Fairfax publications uses an American typesetting machine which automatically spells these words without the U While this endlessly frustrates purists such as myself who object to US spelling it also causes amusement and confusion a recent TV guide article on the soapie Neighbours for instance included a sentence part of which read the neighbors represented on Neighbours From Ron Eden Subject zeady words A certain Australian public relationsmarketing communications Company warn that they will deduct penalty dollars from payments of writers who deliver projects containing words spelt with American zs instead of EnglishAustralian ss I asked one of the partners on one occasion what was the most regular offender and she told me it was recognized rather than with an s She got a note in the mail from a writer once which stated he would be more careful in the future I apologize he wrote From Jonas Eklund Subject Swedish English In reply to your inquiry on the various usages on English in nonEnglish speaking countries I can report that in Swedish schools or at least the one that I went to each pupil supposedly chooses the kind of English he or she wants to write British American US or even Australian My mother being from over there I obviously chose the American way of putting words in writing The standard spelling and pronunciation taught in Sweden are traditionally the Britishupperclass English versions However the tendency in actual usage among young people is towards compliance with the world hegemony of American culture Im always rather surprised to hear another young Swede speak British English fluently and Ill suppose that he or she has lived in Britain or has some other ties to that country From Anatole Beck Subject British English In the many years I have lived in England on and off I have made it my business to learn their language So I am constantly being taken off guard by their adoptions of American usage I first had a sense of this in when my son told me that half the students at his comprehensive school said zee instead of zed for z Later on I was surprised to hear truck used for what the Brits used to call a lorry In British a truck is a railway carriage not car with only four wheels principally for carrying cargoes like coal It is also the fourwheeled unit at each end of a standard railway carriage what Americans call a bogey In British a bogey was a hole in golf played at par but now they use the American version one over par American words like tire for tyre have even crept into their lovely and demanding crosswords which have not yet been edited into crossword puzzles The really interesting thing is that in most cases they do not hear the change themselves I tell them it is true but they are unaware Two of the most interesting cases are metaphors which I swear the British had right thirty years ago but now they use the flawed American version One is You cant eat your cake and still have it and the other is Heels over head in love Of course you can have your cake and then eat it but not conversely Heels over head is flipped over Head over heels is standing up straight In this connection the American usage ass backwards has not yet been taken up Of course it is ass forwards which is the English language translation of preposterous Ass backwards is how things are sposed to be From Kelly Aparicio Subject AWordADaytestudinate Todays testudinate made me think about coincidences in different languages In Uruguay smaller country compared to its huge neighbors Argentina and Brazil we usually refer to someone who is a lazy or rather useless person as pelotudo or boludo these being non educated words but very accurate as they mean that the balls or testes of such a person weigh so much that he moves very slowly From today on Ill be using refined language when I use the term testudo instead From David King Subject Crabwise This word reminded me of a Smothers Brothers bit In a song the brothers sing about the doomed love of a crab and a lobster I remember the reason why this love was doomed to failure as the brothers sang because crabs walk sideways and lobsters walk straight From Subject Crabs Yesterdays word made me think of a musical term for playing a tune backwards cancrizans It is used especially in fuguing when the theme goes retrograde From Graham Summers Subject Headline verb confusions These headlines reminded me of one of my favourites This was the headline to an article that announced that Michael Foot left wing MP in UK was to lead a group looking at nuclear disarmament Foot Heads Arms Body From Rene Buchanan Subject New usage A friend traveled to NYC and reported how changed was much typical NYC behaviornot as surly more polite driving etc Indeed he heard an aggressive drivers behavior described as so From Eric Shackle Subject Newspaper Names AWAD subscribers may be interested in an article about US Newspapers Eccentric Names just posted at shacklearticleseccentrichtm Clicking on some of the quirky titles presents a wonderful picture of life today in smalltown America From Wordsmith Sponsor Subject Sponsor of this AWADmail issue Robert J Thieblot Advertisement Telemachus or the Memoirs of an Immortal God by Robert J Thieblot A good read for the intelligent Check it out at Amazoncom execobidosASINhttpwwwwordorgst From Barbara A Kerr Subject black and white One of the comments in todays newsletter expressed a wish that black and white were more ambiguousas is the word blue Id like to suggest that white at least does not always mean good In fact it can sometimes imply that something is boring deceptive or dangerous white noise whitewash whiteout as in a severe snow storm white water andwith tongue in cheekwhite male From Klyd Watkins Subject literal How can we save the word literal Can we demand that no one on radio or television use the word unless they are licensed to do so that license to be granted only after a word essay exam demonstrating an understanding of its meaning Can we offer a bounty to comedians for ridiculing its misuse I know I would chip in We cant stop change in language But the word literal is very useful used correctly The word is degrees wrong when a figurative expression is said to be literal as in Carl Malone literally took the team on his shoulders or she literally broke his heart but more pernicious is the irrelevant use when the expression is not figurative to begin with as in they literally helped a great deal or he literally came in and changed things This is becoming more and more common The word which was never that common in its correct usage is becoming very popular as a substitute for actually or truly or really Its all over the media not just by sports announcers but news anchors as well Maybe you could have as a weekly theme words whose meanings are changing in unfortunate ways By unfortunate in this case I mean that a word that precisely describes a very specific situation which is difficult to express without the term is coming to mean something which has many alternate expressions but there must be other ways words are becoming less useful or have already become less useful than with a previous meaning I literally did a few themes on this topic last year See Words often used in a sense different from their established definitions and Words that have reversed their meaning in January archive Anu awadthemeshtml Slang is a language that rolls up its sleeves spits on its hands and goes to work Carl Sandburg poet and biographer To place an ad in

about Words and Languages From Monica Clements Subject ocker Seeing the word ocker reminds me of a story told by a friend It took place during the Australian air traffic controllers strike of the s when interstate travellers were desperate for any form of airborne transport and all the light planes were full My friends father was one of the people who tried to hitch a ride on a light plane He rushed up to the stewardabout to close the plane doors and asked breathlessly whether there was any room only to be answered with the immortal line Sorry ocker the Fokkers chocker From Sam Robinson Subject Ocker Id thought that the word ocker had been around since before TV and it turned out I was only partly wrong According to the Australian National Universitys web site ANDCAustwordsockerhtml and how could you disagree with a source named ANU Ocker has a longer history as a nickname in Australia for anyone with the personal name Oscar or Horace or with the surname Stevens just as Blue is the nickname often given to people with red hair Id wager that the character in the Mavis Bramston Show was known by a nickname because a bloke like Ocker would hardly ever be known by his real name especially if it was Horace From D McCulloch Subject Re AWordADaydauphin Never occurred to me before this the heir to the French throne was the dolphin while the heir to the British is the Prince of Whales Nothing fishy at all about that mammally perhaps From Kevin Purcell Subject Diverging Languages UK Ill give you a ring US Ill call you UK The number is engaged US The number is busy Of course this leads to some interesting puns in British English that dont work in US English Ill give you a ring unless your engaged has two meanings in UK English but only one in US English From Jane Hope Subject English vs American I was married to an Englishman during the s I had no idea what he wanted when he asked for a bobbin of cotton He meant a spool of thread Also at first he would promise to knock me up in the morning which he thought meant he would come by to wake me up From William Youmans Subject variations of English This discussion regarding the different meanings of American English and English English reminds me of an experience in a London restaurant several years ago I was in the company of my wife and two middle aged American ladies Upon the completion of our very good meal In England yet one of the ladies in a loud voice stated I feel really stuffed Upon observing amused glances from our fellow diners perhaps imaginary on my part I suggested to her that being stuffed in England had a much different connotation than being satiated with food From Jennifer Reibel Subject pronunciation Many years ago while living as an American houseguest in the north of England my host offered to take me to the lakeshore This confused me since there was no lake nearby and my hosts didnt drive a car Instead we walked downtown to a ramshackle building and walked up three flights of stairs to a leek show The British are fanatical gardeners and love to show off their talents Also on display were tomatoes onions and many kinds of flowers But the event was known throughout the community as the leek show From Nathaniel G Higgs Subject Language is changing Just as British English differs from American English I find this true with other languages too In Spain a car is called a coche and a coach or cart is called a carro In the Americas a car is called a carro and a coach is called a coche There are several other words that have opposite and different meanings depending upon the country yet they all speak Spanish Language is changing constantly and those changes do not always occur concurrently within the global community From Kathryn Flueck Subject Re British English Is it too late to comment about differences between American and British English I have seen nothing on one of the most colorful aspects of British English Cockney rhyming slang perhaps because it is considered somewhat lower class although it has been around for more than a hundred years and some of the terms have crept into more common usage clearly no pun intended The theory is it was started as a code language The idea was to use a phrase usually two words the second of which rhymes with the word one wants to use then often the rhyming word is dropped off making the statement impossible to understand unless one knows the term Thus apples and pears rhymes with stairs so if one asks where a particular room or thing is one might be told it is up the apples Use your loaf means Use your head for loaf of bread rhymes with head Once I fixed scrambled eggs for some Cockney friends and was asked if I had any rocking horse I was at a total loss of course Turned out they were asking for ketchup which the English call sauce and in Cockney English horse and sauce rhyme hoase and soace For those interested I highly recommend the book Cockney Rabbit by Ray Puxley Rabbit stands for talk The phrase is rabbit and pork and in Cockney English pork and talk rhyme poke and toke From Kovacs Istvan Subject Palindromes I know its not the current topic and its related to computer languages just as strongly as to English still I thought maybe youd appreciate this Theres a contest for abusing the C programming language the International Obfuscated C Code Contest wwwiocccorg One of my favourite people who regularly participate is Brian Westley One of his programs is completely symmetric each line is a palindrome westleyc Maybe you think this has nothing to do with English Maybe thisll help you change your mind westleyc From Anthony Stevens Subject AWADmail issue Do all recipients of AWAD appreciate the forum available to exchange comments and chat in this more interactive manner on the discussion board of the site Men women and fish from all over the world are represented so all are made welcome Take a look at board From Susan Lubell Subject sigh My friend Kris first sent me AWAD about a year ago and I initially cursed her for one more bit of seemingly annoying junk mail Because of our long friendship I grudgingly read it for a few days fully meaning to unsubscribe and then to my amazement fell in love Thank you Anu for the untold pleasure you give me and now my daughters almost every day All words are pegs to hang ideas on Henry Ward Beecher

about Words and Languages From Hans Feuss Subject Re AWordADayaufklarung I am now years of age but during my youth the word aufklaerung note the umlaut here had a very specific meaning Having received aufklaerung or having been aufgeklaert ALWAYS meant that your parentselders etc have told you not necessarily taught you the ways of the birds and bees and how babies were made I suppose this is a form of enlightenment but not necessarily in the way it was presented Also noted by Pamela MatsudaDunn and Raul Cucalon From Quincy Liu Subject Anschluss Before the word Anschluss became encrusted with the political overtone of being taken over it had and still has the straight forward meaning of having connection to eg by knowing a certain contact person one has the Anschluss to an organization or a group From Eric Wilson Subject Succinct definition of kitsch Some years back on a BBC radio program called My Work I heard the most succinct definition of kitsch kitsch A Venus de Milo statue with a clock its belly Says it all dont you agree From Randall Gray Subject AWordADaykitsch We were discussing what someone ought to wear to a moderately formal function when a voice from the rabble piped up Remember Kitsch never goes out of style It is now on the wall in our loo along with a motley collection of other similar aphorisms both humourous and wise From Gretta Small Subject Spelling Why have you chosen to OMIT the umlaut in gemutlichkeit your spelling rather than to observe the convention using an e following the oughttobe umlauted character to indicate the umlaut normally observed when the umlauted character is not available on the keyboard This is done even in Germany Thus the word would be spelled Gemuetlichkeit The umlauted u has a completely different pronunciation from the nonumlauted u and thus is absolutely essential I lived in Germany for many years and learned this the hard way eg schwuel WITH the umlaut means humid and schwul means homosexual From Rudolph Chelminski Subject Re German words I have received a multitude of complaints that the German words I selected for AWAD as a Guest Wordsmith were missing umlauts and were not capitalized as is standard German practice for nouns Two explanations for this Many most American keyboards mine included do not have the umlaut symbol and once German or Hindi or Afghan or whatever words have been kidnapped into our language they are no longer what they were Now that we have them in captivity they have to play by OUR rules hehhehheh So no accents umlauts diacritical marks or whatever And no capitalizations From Mark Willis Subject Fifteen minutes of fame for chad Ive been enjoying your AWAD mailings for over a year now and every once in awhile I see in print a word I had recently learned from the daily morsels you send But I doubt if any newlylearned word so far has appeared as prominently to me as the term chad AWAD For the past six days the election of the president in the United States has been literally and figuratively hinging on the chads attached in various conditions to the manuallypunched ballots in the state of Florida as election officials examine them for hints of the voters electoral intent When I originally saw chad on your list I wondered why we needed a name for such an item Now I realize that every word will have its fifteen minutes of fame Whenever I see or hear the word which the news media often stop to define before proceeding with the story I think of AWAD Thank you for doing your part to inform our electoral process here in the United States For those who missed it first time around the word chad is available at wordschadhtml If you wish to see the theme under which it appeared and the entire weeks words check out the archives for Nov at awadarchiveshtml Anu From Brian West Subject Slang I have with much interest read the correspondence on English rhyming slang This reminds me of an alternative slang used on occasion by my late Father and allegedly by Butchers in England where words were reversed thus eson was nose ecaf esaf was face and so forth Quite difficult to understand until acquainted with the rules From Suzy Subject speaking backwards Since most people who subscribe to AWAD are linguaphiles I would expect that many have a facility with languages in general Im wondering how common the ability to speak backwards is For example one could instantly translate while speaking Hello my name is John into Olleh ym eman si Nhoj I can do it and Ive only met one other person who could do it as well Is this a fairly common ability I tnod kniht os Una Dictionary Spell binder Joseph F Morris Send your comments about words to AWADmail archives are available at awadawadmailhtml To get them by

about Words and Languages From Hans Feuss Subject Re AWordADayaufklarung I am now years of age but during my youth the word aufklaerung note the umlaut here had a very specific meaning Having received aufklaerung or having been aufgeklaert ALWAYS meant that your parentselders etc have told you not necessarily taught you the ways of the birds and bees and how babies were made I suppose this is a form of enlightenment but not necessarily in the way it was presented Also noted by Pamela MatsudaDunn and Raul Cucalon From Quincy Liu Subject Anschluss Before the word Anschluss became encrusted with the political overtone of being taken over it had and still has the straight forward meaning of having connection to eg by knowing a certain contact person one has the Anschluss to an organization or a group From Eric Wilson Subject Succinct definition of kitsch Some years back on a BBC radio program called My Work I heard the most succinct definition of kitsch kitsch A Venus de Milo statue with a clock its belly Says it all dont you agree From Randall Gray Subject AWordADaykitsch We were discussing what someone ought to wear to a moderately formal function when a voice from the rabble piped up Remember Kitsch never goes out of style It is now on the wall in our loo along with a motley collection of other similar aphorisms both humourous and wise From Gretta Small Subject Spelling Why have you chosen to OMIT the umlaut in gemutlichkeit your spelling rather than to observe the convention using an e following the oughttobe umlauted character to indicate the umlaut normally observed when the umlauted character is not available on the keyboard This is done even in Germany Thus the word would be spelled Gemuetlichkeit The umlauted u has a completely different pronunciation from the nonumlauted u and thus is absolutely essential I lived in Germany for many years and learned this the hard way eg schwuel WITH the umlaut means humid and schwul means homosexual From Rudolph Chelminski Subject Re German words I have received a multitude of complaints that the German words I selected for AWAD as a Guest Wordsmith were missing umlauts and were not capitalized as is standard German practice for nouns Two explanations for this Many most American keyboards mine included do not have the umlaut symbol and once German or Hindi or Afghan or whatever words have been kidnapped into our language they are no longer what they were Now that we have them in captivity they have to play by OUR rules hehhehheh So no accents umlauts diacritical marks or whatever And no capitalizations From Mark Willis Subject Fifteen minutes of fame for chad Ive been enjoying your AWAD mailings for over a year now and every once in awhile I see in print a word I had recently learned from the daily morsels you send But I doubt if any newlylearned word so far has appeared as prominently to me as the term chad AWAD For the past six days the election of the president in the United States has been literally and figuratively hinging on the chads attached in various conditions to the manuallypunched ballots in the state of Florida as election officials examine them for hints of the voters electoral intent When I originally saw chad on your list I wondered why we needed a name for such an item Now I realize that every word will have its fifteen minutes of fame Whenever I see or hear the word which the news media often stop to define before proceeding with the story I think of AWAD Thank you for doing your part to inform our electoral process here in the United States For those who missed it first time around the word chad is available at wordschadhtml If you wish to see the theme under which it appeared and the entire weeks words check out the archives for Nov at awadarchiveshtml Anu From Brian West Subject Slang I have with much interest read the correspondence on English rhyming slang This reminds me of an alternative slang used on occasion by my late Father and allegedly by Butchers in England where words were reversed thus eson was nose ecaf esaf was face and so forth Quite difficult to understand until acquainted with the rules From Suzy Subject speaking backwards Since most people who subscribe to AWAD are linguaphiles I would expect that many have a facility with languages in general Im wondering how common the ability to speak backwards is For example one could instantly translate while speaking Hello my name is John into Olleh ym eman si Nhoj I can do it and Ive only met one other person who could do it as well Is this a fairly common ability I tnod kniht os Una Dictionary Spell binder Joseph F Morris Send your comments about words to AWADmail archives are available at awadawadmailhtml To get them by

about Words and Languages From Monica Clements Subject ocker Seeing the word ocker reminds me of a story told by a friend It took place during the Australian air traffic controllers strike of the s when interstate travellers were desperate for any form of airborne transport and all the light planes were full My friends father was one of the people who tried to hitch a ride on a light plane He rushed up to the stewardabout to close the plane doors and asked breathlessly whether there was any room only to be answered with the immortal line Sorry ocker the Fokkers chocker From Sam Robinson Subject Ocker Id thought that the word ocker had been around since before TV and it turned out I was only partly wrong According to the Australian National Universitys web site ANDCAustwordsockerhtml and how could you disagree with a source named ANU Ocker has a longer history as a nickname in Australia for anyone with the personal name Oscar or Horace or with the surname Stevens just as Blue is the nickname often given to people with red hair Id wager that the character in the Mavis Bramston Show was known by a nickname because a bloke like Ocker would hardly ever be known by his real name especially if it was Horace From D McCulloch Subject Re AWordADaydauphin Never occurred to me before this the heir to the French throne was the dolphin while the heir to the British is the Prince of Whales Nothing fishy at all about that mammally perhaps From Kevin Purcell Subject Diverging Languages UK Ill give you a ring US Ill call you UK The number is engaged US The number is busy Of course this leads to some interesting puns in British English that dont work in US English Ill give you a ring unless your engaged has two meanings in UK English but only one in US English From Jane Hope Subject English vs American I was married to an Englishman during the s I had no idea what he wanted when he asked for a bobbin of cotton He meant a spool of thread Also at first he would promise to knock me up in the morning which he thought meant he would come by to wake me up From William Youmans Subject variations of English This discussion regarding the different meanings of American English and English English reminds me of an experience in a London restaurant several years ago I was in the company of my wife and two middle aged American ladies Upon the completion of our very good meal In England yet one of the ladies in a loud voice stated I feel really stuffed Upon observing amused glances from our fellow diners perhaps imaginary on my part I suggested to her that being stuffed in England had a much different connotation than being satiated with food From Jennifer Reibel Subject pronunciation Many years ago while living as an American houseguest in the north of England my host offered to take me to the lakeshore This confused me since there was no lake nearby and my hosts didnt drive a car Instead we walked downtown to a ramshackle building and walked up three flights of stairs to a leek show The British are fanatical gardeners and love to show off their talents Also on display were tomatoes onions and many kinds of flowers But the event was known throughout the community as the leek show From Nathaniel G Higgs Subject Language is changing Just as British English differs from American English I find this true with other languages too In Spain a car is called a coche and a coach or cart is called a carro In the Americas a car is called a carro and a coach is called a coche There are several other words that have opposite and different meanings depending upon the country yet they all speak Spanish Language is changing constantly and those changes do not always occur concurrently within the global community From Kathryn Flueck Subject Re British English Is it too late to comment about differences between American and British English I have seen nothing on one of the most colorful aspects of British English Cockney rhyming slang perhaps because it is considered somewhat lower class although it has been around for more than a hundred years and some of the terms have crept into more common usage clearly no pun intended The theory is it was started as a code language The idea was to use a phrase usually two words the second of which rhymes with the word one wants to use then often the rhyming word is dropped off making the statement impossible to understand unless one knows the term Thus apples and pears rhymes with stairs so if one asks where a particular room or thing is one might be told it is up the apples Use your loaf means Use your head for loaf of bread rhymes with head Once I fixed scrambled eggs for some Cockney friends and was asked if I had any rocking horse I was at a total loss of course Turned out they were asking for ketchup which the English call sauce and in Cockney English horse and sauce rhyme hoase and soace For those interested I highly recommend the book Cockney Rabbit by Ray Puxley Rabbit stands for talk The phrase is rabbit and pork and in Cockney English pork and talk rhyme poke and toke From Kovacs Istvan Subject Palindromes I know its not the current topic and its related to computer languages just as strongly as to English still I thought maybe youd appreciate this Theres a contest for abusing the C programming language the International Obfuscated C Code Contest wwwiocccorg One of my favourite people who regularly participate is Brian Westley One of his programs is completely symmetric each line is a palindrome westleyc Maybe you think this has nothing to do with English Maybe thisll help you change your mind westleyc From Anthony Stevens Subject AWADmail issue Do all recipients of AWAD appreciate the forum available to exchange comments and chat in this more interactive manner on the discussion board of the site Men women and fish from all over the world are represented so all are made welcome Take a look at board From Susan Lubell Subject sigh My friend Kris first sent me AWAD about a year ago and I initially cursed her for one more bit of seemingly annoying junk mail Because of our long friendship I grudgingly read it for a few days fully meaning to unsubscribe and then to my amazement fell in love Thank you Anu for the untold pleasure you give me and now my daughters almost every day All words are pegs to hang ideas on Henry Ward Beecher
