proposed CA RPS has major implications for our business from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe rspective We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig ht as to the political climate as possible Having witnessed the first meet ing of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento I am perso nally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for m If they pass a requirement for new renewables next year this transla tes into MWm off a MW peak load in CA We have very good working r elationships with several of the biomass generators in California includin g generators with new resources and we are actively negotiating a marketin g agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the next couple of years The critical question of course is who will actual ly have the short position in California If it is just the DWR then they will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases If the utilities end up serving load they will be in the market looking for the leastcost resources and new biomass will clearly be a part of the mix national RPS follow up with John Shelk

more importantly Nick was a friend We had kayaked together on several occasions and had planned when I saw him last over breakfast to meet and kayak together as a regular thing He had told me at that time about having just dropped his son off for a multiweek backcountry wilderness excursion in some remote canyon in the Rockies Utah I dont know if his son even knows yet How awful Nick lived near me but I dont know of where his survivors are to be found He was divorced Ive met his brother who lives in DC Are you aware of what is being done in his memory or where and to whom I could send a note of condolence I am heading up the planning committee for New England Regional Wind Power Issues Workshop to be held in Boston in late October Nick had volunteered to speak and offered Enron Wind to sponsor the event which neither I nor NREL the organizer and primary event sponsor had yet followed up on As Nick was involved in and supporting a number of regional wind development efforts and was

several important principles th at we have learned through experience regarding RPSdisclosure Ive been working on these issues for about years and they have a long and often complex history After youve had a chance to digest the below Im glad t o help out in our response RPS and disclosure requirements need to be developed together Further since environmental disclosure is a requirement in states and RPS in states its important that we dont have overlapping redundant requiremen ts on a national level This can ultimately add to the customers bill bec ause of the administrative cost to comply with these requirements For disclosure the label calculation how you derive the fuel mix is the most crucial Suppliers need the following a the ability to project what they will deliver to customers over a spe cified settlement period we greatly prefer annually if they are differe ntiating their products either with bilateral contracts or claims about th e environmental benefits of the product Otherwise suppliers would submit a label with the default mix for spot market purchases As Kevin pointed out below this allows flexibility in determining how the products will be sourced either through bilaterals spot andor renewable energy certifi cate REC purchases b For suppliers purchasing from the spot market there needs to be defa ult fuel mix data provided to suppliers c After a calendar year suppliers would provide customers with an annu al label based on actual fuel purchases historic label for differentia ted products including REC purchases and bilaterals For system mix produ cts the projections and historical would be the same The latter has worke d well for EES d There needs to be a lag inbetween the timing of label distribution f or projections and historic label for the product claim This will allow an y necessary true up between unanticipated customer usage and the amount of power purchased for the customer For RPS and disclosure It is extremely important that any national RPS disclosure requirement be developed with a certificate trading program A certificate is usually defined as one MWh of renewable energy that has bee n generated and represents the attributes or environmental benefits of the generation separate from the underlying power This should be a tradable instrument separate from the power Renewable energy certificates RECs c an be bought sold traded separately from power and allows vital flexibili ty to get renewables to regions of the country where the supply might be co nstrained or where renewables such as wind and solar are not conducive to b eing sited RECs also provide verification for the purchase of power attri butes for RPS and disclosure As Christi was stating below it is impossibl e with our sophisticated wholesale markets to track all electrons from gene ration to end use consumption The beauty of certificate trading programs is that they create a secondary market by which the attributes of power can be tracked through various trades Certificates trading programs are not a lways limited to renewable energy In New England they are developing a f ull certificates based system by which all generation would be issued certi ficates This helps support the disclosure requirements in the East Regards Stacey Bolton Environmental Strategies Enron Corp direct cell mailto Original Message From Guerrero Janel

Novosel Sarah Shortridge Pat Guerrero Janel SubjectKevin Presto comments on the summary of Bingaman bill John Kevin Presto head of East Power Trading had these comments Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards Kevin says NERC should b e eliminated Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure Kevin says that the uniform reporting to consumers in monthly electric bills of the known ene rgy sources is not good because it supports dayahead source requirements for retail suppliers Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose h ow to source their portfolio whether from bilateral contracts done on an a head basis or purchases in the spot market John the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill m ay alleviate this concern but I dont know enough about how that works S everal years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clea n energy generator and it can trade those credits Therefore the seller o f clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean cre dits in order to claim it sold clean energy meaning that the clean generat or was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount o f credits That program recognized that you cant specifically source a c lean generator to a load because electricity doesnt flow that way Thus portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported But I don t know how this bills provisions would work You probably have the Enron experts on this used to be Janel G Thanks

SentTuesday July PM ToBolton Stacey Ring Richard Castano Marianne SubjectCA BIZMIX Issues Hello all I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar ding the DASRing of customers in California Unfortunately it wasnt what we wanted to hear On the easy side of things all residential customers PGE SCE SDGE wer e turned back to the utilities starting May th DASRs were submitted and they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles etc These customers received a letter letting them know about it On the commercial side of things Diann had no distinctions between small c ommercial large commercial industrial customers SDGE customers have been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed In PGE SCE IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu ously received our product All other PGE SCE customers were originally submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on January That prov ides enough issues of its own but Ill get to that PGE did a virtual swi tch so as of Jan all these customers became PGEs again but with SCE w hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles etc All deDASRed customers were then reDASRed back to us starting June and Di ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were reDASRed but ne w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS Red to us No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome rs but as we discussed some personal basis notice may have been given to our larger customers through the reps So Im not worried about the residential side well have to send them a n annual historical label next April with perhaps a letter explaining why theyre still receiving info from us As far as the commercialindustrial No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers Bolt on Stacey We or PR should prepare a customer letter as discussed with Peggy notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP Theyve been receiving system mix since Feb and weve been proceeding as if it were actually BIZMIX ie the nd quarter labels they just rece ived indicated BIZMIX as appropriate to the customer Bolton Stacey W e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w e will be more than off of our projection v what we actually delivered The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual and you dont have to show an extra column w the difference if you are win del ta band between projection and actual We can change the projection for t hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter What are the new customers those as being DASRed to us the first time as of June being told they are receiving Are they being marketed BIZM IX Bolton Stacey We should ensure this is not the case with originati on Someone in Jeremy Bs shop will most likely know As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes will we just use those given as the date of submission ie Jan May June as it is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred Bolto n Stacey We should discuss this a bit Im not sure that this will rea lly matter at the end of the day The CEC has instructed us all along to s end labels to the customers which we have Well report the purchases br own and green as normal at the end of the year Let me know your input Heather

Original Message From Ring Richard SentFriday August AM ToBolton Stacey SubjectRE CA emissions factor Stacey Below is my response to the Texas Kinkos contract Let me know what you t hink Thanks Richard Paul I am not sure how the various sections align between the second contract v ersion from Wednesdays meeting with Kinkos and the Master Agreement however I will take my best shot at the renewable language Under Section SCOPE the current language states EESI will ensure t hat the Energy delivered to Customer will be associated with the generation of an equivalent amount of renewable energy registered to the Customer an d all the environmental attributes associated with the generation of this r enewable energy will be the sole possession of the Customer My concern here with the way that the language is currently worded revolves around the portion of the sentence regarding all the environmental attrib utes I do not want to be obligated to provide all the environmental att ributes to Customer if either i Enron does not acquire all of the enviro nmental attributes it its transaction to acquire the renewable energy and or renewable creditsattributes or ii as normal course of business regar ding transaction of renewable energy andor renewable creditsattributes all of the environmental attributes do not transfer with title to the rene wable energy andor renewable creditsattributes I would propose to replace the above referenced contract language with the following EESI will ensure that the Energy delivered to Customer will be associated with generation of an equivalent amount of renewable energy and that all of the environmental attributes as a normal course of business associated with the purchase and sale of renewable energy andor renewable credits shall pass from EESI to Customer Under Section DEFINITIONS the current definition for Renewable Energy states means electric energy generated by facilities utilizing renewable energy sources This would include facilities like windmill farms photovo ltaic cells geothermal heat recovery plants landfill gas recover plants and small selective hydroelectric projects no greater than MW These f acilities use existing natural systems wind sun thermal heat from the ea rth biological decomposition and flowing water to generate their electric ity I would propose to not hard code the definition for Renewable Energy into the Master Agreement but rather define Renewable Energy for each Tran saction Agreement under the Master Agreement For the Master Agreement delete the definition of Renewable Energy and replace with the following Renewable Energy shall have the meaning ascribed in the Transaction Ag reement to this Master Agreement I would propose that the definition of Renewable Energy for purposes of t he Transaction Agreement relative to Kinkos Texas Sites should be the foll owing Renewable Energy means renewable energy credit which represents r enewable energy that is physically metered and verified in the State of Tex as Renewable energy credits in the State of Texas are derived from techno logy that exclusively relies on an energy source that is naturally regenera ted over a short time and derived directly from the sun indirectly from th e sun or from moving water or other natural movements and mechanisms of th e environment and include the following sun wind geothermal hydroelect ric wave or tidal energy biomass or biomass waste products including lan dfill gas and any other source that does ont rely on energy resources deri ved from fossil fuels waste products from fossil fuels or waste products from inorganic sources For purpose of this Transaction Agreement EESI wil l fulfill the renewable energy requirement exclusively from one hundred pe rcent wind sources

Thanks Heather for the helpful update Original Message From Mathis Heather SentTuesday July PM ToBolton Stacey Ring Richard Castano Marianne SubjectCA BIZMIX Issues Hello all I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar ding the DASRing of customers in California Unfortunately it wasnt what we wanted to hear On the easy side of things all residential customers PGE SCE SDGE wer e turned back to the utilities starting May th DASRs were submitted and they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles etc These customers received a letter letting them know about it On the commercial side of things Diann had no distinctions between small c ommercial large commercial industrial customers SDGE customers have been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed In PGE SCE IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu ously received our product All other PGE SCE customers were originally submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on January That prov ides enough issues of its own but Ill get to that PGE did a virtual swi tch so as of Jan all these customers became PGEs again but with SCE w hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles etc All deDASRed customers were then reDASRed back to us starting June and Di ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were reDASRed but ne w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS Red to us No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome rs but as we discussed some personal basis notice may have been given to our larger customers through the reps So Im not worried about the residential side well have to send them a n annual historical label next April with perhaps a letter explaining why theyre still receiving info from us As far as the commercialindustrial No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers Bolt on Stacey We or PR should prepare a customer letter as discussed with Peggy notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP Theyve been receiving system mix since Feb and weve been proceeding as if it were actually BIZMIX ie the nd quarter labels they just rece ived indicated BIZMIX as appropriate to the customer Bolton Stacey W e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w e will be more than off of our projection v what we actually delivered The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual and you dont have to show an extra column w the difference if you are win del ta band between projection and actual We can change the projection for t hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter What are the new customers those as being DASRed to us the first time as of June being told they are receiving Are they being marketed BIZM IX Bolton Stacey We should ensure this is not the case with originati on Someone in Jeremy Bs shop will most likely know As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes will we just use those given as the date of submission ie Jan May June as it is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred Bolto n Stacey We should discuss this a bit Im not sure that this will rea lly matter at the end of the day The CEC has instructed us all along to s end labels to the customers which we have Well report the purchases br own and green as normal at the end of the year Let me know your input Heather Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

yesterdays meeting at PJM Our stated coalition goal going in to the meeting was to ensure the recognition of certificates or financial commodities representing the attributes of energy and capability with system New England is developing While phase I will not meet either goal PJM readily admits that there are adaptations that need to be made to the system that meet our goals for Phase II of the program To this end a users group was establish Ive listed highlights of the meeting and next steps below The formation of this group is a VERY positive step in moving toward a system that will most effectively meet our goals Finally Im attaching a list of the meeting attendees Let me know if you have any questions Im encouraged by these developments and once again would like to thank all of you for your support and teamwork on this crucial issue to all of our companiesorganizations Highlights of Meeting Regulatory update Regulators all expressed interest in hearing from stakeholders on Phase II of PJM GATS system In particular Linda Nowiki from NJ BPU noted that because of the considerable change of the Board composition since the adoption of the disclosure rules the upcoming expansion to Commissioners and a likely new Board President and the RTO proceedings that they were particularly interested in stakeholder feedback for the GATS system Phase I operational by end of year and will produce company labels comprised of an aggregation of the load purchased Phase I is based on a mathematical formula and will aggregate all fuel sources by company not product The limitations include an inability to carve out dedicated resources such as a specific hydro purchase from a companys system the inability to get to the plant level detail unit only the inability to segment the company fuel and emissions label into products the emissions data taken from EGrid being dated and not accommodating recent emissions reductions based on retrofits or installed control technologies and the inability to distinguish whether the unit meets class I or class II RPS PJM plans to distribute the first set of labels to LSEs and regulators but realizes the data on the labels due to the inabilities will not be useful Phase II John Dadorian project lead for GATS program has toyed with several conceptual ideas for Phase II The goal is to have the system operational by March in time for the label distribution period for both NJ and MD John wants Phase II to be webbased with suppliersgeneratorsmarketers having access to their data John had one scenario that he presented whereby PJM would track by contract path the fuel and emissions mix of suppliers After a specified time period PJM would submit preliminary labels to suppliers Suppliers would then have a choice of modifying their label based on trading attributes PJM has not made any decisions about Phase II and is looking to members for comment to this end they suggested forming a users group Formation of a users group to address Phase II Conceptual Design and Implementation Enron PGE NEG Hydro Quebec PSEG and New Power made up the needed members to start the group The users group is NOT limited to PJM members and a sign up sheet was distributed This users group will be announced at the next PJM meeting on November th The first meeting of our users group will be held in Wilmington DE on Thursday Details will be circulated Comment Period Comments are due by October th to John Dadorian on Phase I Since these labels are basically not going to have any purpose because the data will be useless I dont know if its worth the effort to submit comments I think our focus should be on Phase II Please let me know your thoughts NEXT STEPS While it is VERY positive that we have formed a users group to vet these issues its clear that we still have considerable work to do Denise Foster from PJM will be establishing a list serve for us to circulate ideasissuesconcerns prior to the meeting The meeting participants briefly discussed items for our first meeting including Guidelines for scope of group Identifying Timeline and Milestones target completion date is March Matrix of State Requirements to be done ahead of time Identifying Design issues Capability with New EnglandNew York Accommodating financial transactions or certificates Concerns Identifying true fuel mix v residual average How many entities would participate in a certificate market Treatment of unsold certificates Whether to have the ability to trade financially through settlement and have it recognized by PJMs system Questions Size of spot market Size of bilaterals Size of each states load in PJM ie PA load The additional uses for fuel and emissions mix information besides compliance with RPSDisclosure Have a great weekend Stacey Bolton

a synopsis of the outstanding issues I wanted to get your thought about the following the options I agree with staff that choice is ideal M y second choice is The issue is this Each of the regions has slightly different to dramatically different definitions for eligible resources for a Greene certified electricity product In order to have a national stan dard whereby a marketer can market the same product across the states staf f has proposed certifying generators per region These generators would be certified according to that regions standard The TRECS could then be m arketed anywhere Some folks want to control not only the generators that are certified but the products that are sold in their region Thus the op tion for the highest common denominator choice I think we need to go with the most administratively simple method that will promote the most li quidity Certifying generator or creating a separate TRECs standard seem to be the easiest Let me know your thoughts Id like to get back with Meredith today Also these issues are pretty nebulous so call if you have s Stacey Bolton Environmental Strategies Enron Corp direct cell mailto Original Message From Meredith Wingate ENRON

Travaglini Roger Clark Sam Swanson Serpil Guran Stacey Bolton Maryanne Daniel CcDan Lieberman Andrew Altman Kirk Brown SubjectGenerator based sourcing standards Folks As you know at our last meeting I promised to circulate the different op tions we discussed on generator based sourcing standards The problem we are trying to solve is this Wed like to develop a nation al definition for eligible renewables for certification of TRECs pro ducts under Greene The problem is that if we did a highest common denom inator standard some renewables namely biomass would be excluded We fe el that this would be a somewhat arbitrary exclusion because biomass has b een excluded from some regional standards because of specific regional cir cumstances and that it would not be fair to penalize the entire biomass in dustry by eliminating it from the TRECs Greene market So staff have proposed a generator based sourcing standard Eligibility w ould thus apply to renewable generators not marketers So if a generator qualified they wouldbe able to market their TRECs anywhere in the US The general feedback I got from you was that people didnt like this idea because it wasnt clear for the consumer what types of eligible are a llowed under Greene cert eg Georgia biomass excluded but PA biomass allowed and effectively gave marketers the ability to sell a type of power into a market that might not meet the regional definition of eligibl e eg you could sell forestryderived biomass generated in New England into the PA market the generator would meet the new England definition f or eligible and therefore would be able to sell that power anywhere We discussed a couple of different options for handling this dilemma Her e are a few of the major pros an cons Adopt a single generatorbased sourcing standard for electricity and TRECs this was the proposal by staff pros it is consistent bt electricity and TRECs products and it allows for regional definitions of eligibility cons not clear for the consumer what types of eligible are allowed under Greene cert effectively gives marketers the ability to sell a type of power into a market that might not meet the regional definition of eligibl e Dont change electricity standards keep definition of eligible renewable as regional product standard but have a TRECs standard that is based on the highest common denominator of all regional GreeneGreen p ricing standards A highest common denominator standard would include sola r wind digester gas and possibly LIHI hydro geothermal landfill methan e with some NOx limits I say possibly because these things arent incl uded in green pricing eligibility criteria but we think we might be able t o convince stakeholders there to accept them Pros Meets both regional definitions for what is generated in a state and what is marketed in a state Cons inconsistent standard bt electricity products and TRECs products eliminates biomass and possibly other renewables from eligibility for TR ECs Dont change electricity standard but develop a new national defi nition for what TRECs are eligible this would not necessarily be a hig hest common denominator standard but more of a generally accepted renewa ble standard Pros Doesnt change electricity standard makes it clear for consumers wh ats in a Greene certified product Cons potentially inconsistent standard bt electricity products and TREC s products could undermine regional standards if something is approved as eligible for TRECs but it is not eligible for electricity keep product standard for both electricity and for TRECs requir e both electricity providers and TRECs providers to meet the regional de finitions Pros Meets both regional definitions for what is generated in a state and what is marketed in a state Cons requires TRECs marketers to market different products for different regions could prevent them from seeking certification inconsistent stan dard bt electricity products and TRECs products Please send me your feedback on these different options We did have an op tion but upon reflection it appeared to me to be the same as one of th e other options if this isnt enough selection for you feel free to
