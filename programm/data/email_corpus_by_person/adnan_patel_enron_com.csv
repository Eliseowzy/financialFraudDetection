of assumed name The receipt of the assumed name certificate from the State of Illinois proves that Northern Ilinois Gas Company is an active Corporation set up in GCP as a HQ company with Nicor Gas Company as their assumed name Set up in GCP as a tradename Seems like in Global Counterparty both the counterparties are set up exactly the way it should be The request below is to change the tradenames name from Nicor Gas Company to Northen Ilinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company which I dont have any documentation or instructions for Upon my conversation with Sandy Allison Attorney Nicor Gas at Ph x all the contracts and legal binding documents should carry the name Nicor Gas Company and so does the Assumed Name Certificate says In addition Marcia Nawrocki Attorney Nicor Gas on

Adnan Patel x From Tana CT on AM To Stacey CT cc Adnan NRON Anthony CT Subject Re Northern Illinois Gas CompanyNicor Gas Company Susan Bailey the paralegal working on this master spoke to the Company after receiving these emails They faxed to her a copy of the assumed name certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under the name Nicor Gas Company Per her conversations they have not changed their name they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas Company Being so the online account would have to be renamed as Northern Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company Per my conversation with Stacy Dickson a physical gas lawyer they still transact physical gas under their master with Northern Illinois Gas Company I will have a copy of the assumed name certificate walked down to Adnan If we are all in agreement after this it seems like we need two counterparty names Northern Illinois Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas

all just ONE company one state registered company Im currently waiting on name change documents however this is what it looks like thats going to happen The main HQ company would end up being NICOR

place with Northern Illinois Gas Company There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only trading being done with this entity is online gas trading The issue that needs to be
