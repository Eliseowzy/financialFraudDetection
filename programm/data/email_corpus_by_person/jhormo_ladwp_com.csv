be either one line or a group of lines it has a beginning and an end a POR and a POD Example Midway to COB A flowgate on the other hand is a reference monitoring position which can physically be a collection of locations lumped into a virtual point It can be used for scheduling as well as for metering and is generally described as going into somewhere Example You could combine COB and NOB into a single flowgate defined as Into California Southbound Granularity refers to the degree of detail in your model ie to what extent it is seen through a wideangle lens vs through a magnifying glass So far Ive seen it applied to schedule changes how many times an hour transmission products how small a time increment someone can buy and transmission grids With respect to transmission grids it can be used to describe both paths and flowgates Heres a pair of examples the Mc Cullough Eldorado path one line feet long part of a model with small granularity and Into WSCC a flowgate in a model with extremely large granularity When I wrote the more granular the flowgate model below I meant the larger the scale of your transmission model by flowgates in fact I had the Into WSCC example in mind at the time whereby someone in the Eastern Interconnection could conceivably purchase a transmission right to send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the Western Interconnection Im ccing the rest of the ESWG on this message in case as I suspect I owe our other colleagues the same clarification Your fellow student John Original Message From Robert Schwermann mailto Sent Tuesday January AM To Hormozi John Subject RE ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices John I hate to ask dumb questions as I suppose I should understand this new terminologybut I dont You mention the more granular the flowgate Model Is it possible to explain granularity and the difference between flowgate and path models I hate to always burden you with questions but you are knowledgeable on these issues and I need to get up to speed I guess I owe you a few beers now Thanks Bob Robert D Schwermann SMUD Voice Fax Pin Pager email mailto Original Message From Hormozi John SMTP Sent Monday January PM To Electronic Scheduling Work Group Subject RE ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices John I appreciate your giving the sublists a onceover Ill reply to your comments in the order you wrote them BP says in essence Before you sell a transmission right make sure your grid can support it The gist of BP is If your Transmission Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the purchased transmission right but you can still fit it in then let it flow anyway At the ESC meeting I was looking past the linkage statement about these two BPs instead focusing on the fact that BP is really an OASIS practice while BP is about energy scheduling Now though in the tranquility of my office Im inclined to agree that they should still be considered together Both of these BPs give you a choice between path and flowgate models and the more granular the flowgate model the closer you get to a purely financial transmission market so how would you feel about calling both of them modelindependent BP discusses fragmentary scheduling ie letting a group of entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule which when pieced together form a complete and continuous schedule As written the BP doesnt seem to tie us to any particular transmission model because the fragments could conceivably use any combination of physical and financial transmission rights So this BP would appear to belong in the model independent category We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP and hopefully soon to be shared with the ESC to allow regions like ours to minimize the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of nonemergency generator ramping As drafted these changes would have no effect on current practices in the East so more than one version of each BP would be unnecessary The Applicability section of BP reads in part This Business Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailmentreload by a Scheduling Authority It does not address the process items leading up to the curtailment I would say that BP does not depend on the choice of congestion management method selected By the way Im sharing these comments with ESC Business Practice Task Force Chair Mike McElhany who is apportioning the BP discussions among a series of conference calls to begin as early as January Thank you John for your valuable input John Hormozi LADWP Original Message From Canavan John S mailto Sent Monday January AM To Hormozi John Electronic Scheduling Work Group Subject RE ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices John just a couple of quick comments First BP is identified as an independent issue and BP is identified as a dependent Issues yet both of these BPs work in tandem I would think both of these should be dependent unless I am missing something I guess I would have the same comment for BP The last page describes BPs and that the WSCC is asking to be worked independently I am not sure what this means a West and East proposal for each of these practices Does BP Curtailments and Reloads assume a common nationwide Congestion Management scheme or is this BP totally unrelated or insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme physical or financial Thanks John John Canavan Montana Power Company Original Message From Hormozi John SMTP Sent Thursday January PM To Electronic Scheduling Work Group Subject ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices Greetings everyone The message below from the ESCs Mike McElhany describes the ESCs effort to subdivide its proposed business practices into modelindependent and modeldependent business practice sublists The ESC intends to debate the modelindependent business practices first in anticipation of upcoming FERC pronouncements on transmission market models At last weeks WSCC Electronic Scheduling Work Group Meeting which followed the ESC meeting I promised to reproduce my breakdown lists that I handed to Mike on my way out the door and forward them to you for your perusal Specifically we in WSCC should check whether we concur with this firstcut categorization Remember for this question were not talking about the pros and cons of each business practice but simply identifying which ones as currently drafted presuppose a particular transmission model be it physical financial or some hybrid of the two Guess what The attached list below which Mike prepared for the ESC is MY breakdown Thanks Mike So here it is for you to see After reading my meeting notes Im not sure whether this was supposed to go to the entire ESWG or only to an ESWG task force Bob Harshbarger please refresh my memory on this so I chose to err on the side of wider dissemination Unless anyone out there strongly feels otherwise and I recommend we read the actual business practices before reaching such a conclusion I believe this breakdown to be accurate enough to facilitate discussion I suggest we proceed with our strategem of organizing ESWG conference calls or meetings on the business practices of course at our chairmans discretion in advance of the corresponding ESC conference calls now that we know the ESCs game plan

to discuss Business Practices All At the ESC meeting held in Las Vegas last week it was decided to hold a number of conference calls to futher the development of the Business Practices We have come up with a st cut list of the BPs that are not impacted by the design issues that we filed with FERC Our intention is to hold conference calls on BPs at a time these calls are open to any and all We will announce which BPs are to be discussed the outstanding items and any comments that have been received as part of the agenda for each conference call This is not intended to be the final review of the BPs rather it will help get some actual work accomplished I have attached the st cut of the BPs that are independant of Design Issues and ask for input as to the order and the groups of BPs that should be discussed I would like to schedule the st call for Wednesday the th If you have concerns with the lists andor the grouping of the BPs please respond as soon as possible On Monday the th the offical announcement and agenda for the st conference call will be sent Please get your comments to me if you are not able to participate on any particular call It may be that some the the BPs will be included in multiple conference calls so you will have several opportunities to participate Mike File Independent of RTO Design Issuesdoc
