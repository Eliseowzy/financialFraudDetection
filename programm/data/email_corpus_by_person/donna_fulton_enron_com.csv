<10695545.1075855430150.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,donna.fulton@enron.com,2001-10-11 13:24:01,RE FERC Meeting Update Cc Further info on the MISO case Discussion on the MISO administrative cost adder indicated that the Commission will require that it be charged also to the native load This is because all load must be under the RTO tariff I spoke with staff after the meeting and was told that this was a minimum RTO requirement and had been stated in the original Southern RTO order MISO had not included native load under the RTO tariff as recently as the latest filings made August This is a real backdoor way of requiring MISO to put all load under the RTO tariff and was apparently done on the Commissions own initiative Midwest utilities had argued that they could not recover the administrative cost adder because they had capped retail rates Chairman Wood told them that they could recover the adder because they should be reducing their retail rates because they would not have to provide the same services that the RTO would now provide We will have more details when we read the order but this is another example of this Commission taking bold action on RTOs Original Message From Novosel Sarah Sent Thursday October PM To Kean Steven J Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Shelk John Shortridge Pat Nicolay Christi L Lindberg Susan Fulton Donna Alvarez Ray Briggs Tom Nord Sue Landwehr Susan M Subject FERC Meeting Update FERC Meeting Update Ray and Donna are at the meeting and may have additional comments when they return Interconnection It appears that FERC will issue an Advanced NOPR on interconnection procedures not cost issues which will basically be a strawman proposal encompassing the ERCOT interconnection procedures These procedures will be used as a strawman proposal for standardized interconnection procedures throughout the country FERC is going to hold an informal conference in Washington the week after RTO Week ie the week of Oct to hammer out these issues The hope is that consensus will be reached Once the procedures are resolved FERC will then address costs Wood wanted to address both issues at the same time since they are so closely related but Brownell and Breathitt both thought it was better to separate the issues since cost issues are expected to be more contentious and they did not want to slow down getting standardized procedures in place Market Based Rates This issue was stricken from the agenda Wood said they need more time to study the issue Breathitt stated some concern that they are going to use the SMA screen discussed last meeting because it is still somewhat undefined After discussion however all the commissioners agreed that they are not voting on anything and they will decide whether use of the new screen makes sense when they see a draft order applying the new screen to either a triennial review or a new application for market based rates Due to RTO Week Staff does not expect to get an order out using the new screen until November MidWest ISO Donna will provide a more complete account of the order but there were a couple of interesting statements This case is primarily about rate issues raised by the MidWest ISO filing From the discussion it sounds like the commission is going to provide some RTO guidance to Midwest even though the order does not address the scope issue but it appears that the commissione is still looking at an implementation date of December for MISO We will have to see the order to better understand what this means Wood had some interesting questions about costs Apparently MISO proposes to assess a cent administrative fee for its services Wood asked why the corresponding savings are not being reflected in the individual utilities rates Because the RTO is now going to provide many of the services the utilities were previously providing Wood said he would expect the utilities rates to go down by more than cents collectively and he wonders where those savings are going to be reflected This is good Wood is going after the utilities and not allowing them to play these types of games they have played for years now Carolina Power and Light and Florida Power Corp This is an order on rehearing FERC grants rehearing of a prior order regarding imbalance penalties Some intervenors argued that the penalties should be credited back to customers The prior FERC denied this request and allowed the utility to retain the penalties but the new FERC has granted rehearing Wood said this is consistent with gas and he think basic customer issues should be treated similarly on the gas and electric side This too is a good sign that Wood gets it and sees no reason why the electric industry should not be treated the same as gas We have been arguing for this for years This is hopefully a sign of more good things to come Call us if you have any questions

conference This memo by Nancy Bagot ETS and Donna Fulton Enron Corp summarizes wha t we heard at yesterdays FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue in California on the gas side The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept to very technical facility and service issues Staff did not allow any discussion of pricing because that would be handled in other forums Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference though some of their staffers were in attendance Like many FERC Technical Conferences the May th conference on California Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming other parties for the situation in the California market Generally interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed both to California and within California and some blame SoCalGas lack of adequate takeaway capacity failure to provide open access transmission a nd allocation procedures SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that although this is a tight year service commitments will be met and things a re fine and the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going forward that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas issues in California and that CPUC decisions are coming For FERC Staff there are two issues at hand is the problem the mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity and what amount of infrastructu re should be added into and within California andor is it the allocation methodology at a few highlyconstrained delivery points into the state Overall there is basic agreement that there are problems with both The State Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as adequate with just minor changes and enhancements certainly to serve core customers and likely to serve noncore customers Like the LDCs the state representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a difficult year may not bode well for facilities in normal years in the future leaving intrastate capacity stranded Also both agencies ticked o ff a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes that are designed to improve the delivery system According to the CPUC an d CEC demand in the state is not going to explode getting LDC storage b ack up to normal levels should make the difference FERC Staff questioned the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation s of the state LDC systems allocation methods and the availability of firm capacity on SoCalGas in particular There was great concern among Staff about the inability for a noncore customer to contract for specific capaci ty for primary firm service on SoCal The CPUC noted that there is a comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a nd allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system but the Commission has not yet acted on that settlement When asked why the CPUC h as not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year the witness said that there were not three votes The LDCs Only PGE and SoCalGas appeared before FERC Both were adamant that there was adequate capacity for current demand as proven by the lack of curtailments over the past year They also agree that a primary question i s how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity though its general ly held there should be a excess is that for a normal weather year or a dry hydro year For SoCal in particular Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the next five years with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would bypass their system being built directly along interstates pipelines If capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin he wanted to know wh o would pay for the capacity The central policy question for SoCal comes do wn to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin g interstate capacity or customer demand based on contracts SoCal believe s it should respond to the latter However the LDC cites the CPUC as an obstacle for responding to customers and is looking to the CPUC to accept its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for tradable primary capacity rights For PGE the situation is different because it functions very much like an open access interstate pipeline It does not have the allocation and scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system however there is still a mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity PGE like SoCal claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand though they are planning some enhancements They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in planning for uncertainty but in general the northern California LDC is not facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system as nearly all questions focused on SoCals allocation method firm capac ity availability for noncore customers which include industrials and electric generation and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and Wheeler Ridge and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor e interstate capacity SoCal consistently answered that its proposed comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues but the CPUC will not act on it Interstate Pipelines With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table the pipelines call to ar ms was for more capacity into the state Demand projections by the pipeline representatives were vast and optimistic an example being the Sonoran Pipeline prediction of a Bcf shortfall And each pipe can point t o booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas lack of capacity and the major problem of allocation SoCal currently can only offer secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity SoCal responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes allocations The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand forecasts of the LDCs CPUC CEC and the pipelines Others The financial community Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch pointed to a dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv en certainty on returns and the regulatory structure The message was for FER C to stay the course without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat e rules and for California to fix itself especially the CPUC the weakest link Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers rights are protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be stranded There is concern over additional capacity into constrained delivery points that are already pro rationed especially in light of the recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal will be unloaded by bypassing EG They claimed that there are disincentive s in California regulation to SoCals building capacity specifically the Performancebased Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism Und er these programs SoCal gets to keep of peaking service revenues thus giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services SoCal gets to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms Closing Staff Concerns To wrap up FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always discussed and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California However wi th allocation changes at Topock kicking in the problems are moving to Wheeler Ridge There was also a debate over which is the real problem intrastate capa city or intrastate scheduling SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity issue but the mechanism blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling settlement California Generators believe its all about capacity blam

Infrastructure conference This memo by Nancy Bagot ETS and Donna Fulton Enron Corp summarizes wha t we heard at yesterdays FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue in California on the gas side The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept to very technical facility and service issues Staff did not allow any discussion of pricing because that would be handled in other forums Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference though some of their staffers were in attendance Like many FERC Technical Conferences the May th conference on California Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming other parties for the situation in the California market Generally interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed both to California and within California and some blame SoCalGas lack of adequate takeaway capacity failure to provide open access transmission a nd allocation procedures SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that although this is a tight year service commitments will be met and things a re fine and the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going forward that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas issues in California and that CPUC decisions are coming For FERC Staff there are two issues at hand is the problem the mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity and what amount of infrastructu re should be added into and within California andor is it the allocation methodology at a few highlyconstrained delivery points into the state Overall there is basic agreement that there are problems with both The State Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as adequate with just minor changes and enhancements certainly to serve core customers and likely to serve noncore customers Like the LDCs the state representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a difficult year may not bode well for facilities in normal years in the future leaving intrastate capacity stranded Also both agencies ticked o ff a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes that are designed to improve the delivery system According to the CPUC an d CEC demand in the state is not going to explode getting LDC storage b ack up to normal levels should make the difference FERC Staff questioned the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation s of the state LDC systems allocation methods and the availability of firm capacity on SoCalGas in particular There was great concern among Staff about the inability for a noncore customer to contract for specific capaci ty for primary firm service on SoCal The CPUC noted that there is a comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a nd allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system but the Commission has not yet acted on that settlement When asked why the CPUC h as not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year the witness said that there were not three votes The LDCs Only PGE and SoCalGas appeared before FERC Both were adamant that there was adequate capacity for current demand as proven by the lack of curtailments over the past year They also agree that a primary question i s how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity though its general ly held there should be a excess is that for a normal weather year or a dry hydro year For SoCal in particular Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the next five years with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would bypass their system being built directly along interstates pipelines If capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin he wanted to know wh o would pay for the capacity The central policy question for SoCal comes do wn to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin g interstate capacity or customer demand based on contracts SoCal believe s it should respond to the latter However the LDC cites the CPUC as an obstacle for responding to customers and is looking to the CPUC to accept its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for tradable primary capacity rights For PGE the situation is different because it functions very much like an open access interstate pipeline It does not have the allocation and scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system however there is still a mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity PGE like SoCal claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand though they are planning some enhancements They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in planning for uncertainty but in general the northern California LDC is not facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system as nearly all questions focused on SoCals allocation method firm capac ity availability for noncore customers which include industrials and electric generation and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and Wheeler Ridge and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor e interstate capacity SoCal consistently answered that its proposed comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues but the CPUC will not act on it Interstate Pipelines With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table the pipelines call to ar ms was for more capacity into the state Demand projections by the pipeline representatives were vast and optimistic an example being the Sonoran Pipeline prediction of a Bcf shortfall And each pipe can point t o booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas lack of capacity and the major problem of allocation SoCal currently can only offer secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity SoCal responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes allocations The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand forecasts of the LDCs CPUC CEC and the pipelines Others The financial community Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch pointed to a dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv en certainty on returns and the regulatory structure The message was for FER C to stay the course without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat e rules and for California to fix itself especially the CPUC the weakest link Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers rights are protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be stranded There is concern over additional capacity into constrained delivery points that are already pro rationed especially in light of the recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal will be unloaded by bypassing EG They claimed that there are disincentive s in California regulation to SoCals building capacity specifically the Performancebased Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism Und er these programs SoCal gets to keep of peaking service revenues thus giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services SoCal gets to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms Closing Staff Concerns To wrap up FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always discussed and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California However wi th allocation changes at Topock kicking in the problems are moving to Wheeler Ridge There was also a debate over which is the real problem intrastate capa city or intrastate scheduling SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity issue but the mechanism blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling settlement California Generators believe its all about capacity blam e SoCalGas Future Comments Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June Since the SoCal settlement received so much attention and continues to await action by the CPUC should we get supporters of

conference This memo by Nancy Bagot ETS and Donna Fulton Enron Corp summarizes wha t we heard at yesterdays FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue in California on the gas side The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept to very technical facility and service issues Staff did not allow any discussion of pricing because that would be handled in other forums Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference though some of their staffers were in attendance Like many FERC Technical Conferences the May th conference on California Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming other parties for the situation in the California market Generally interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed both to California and within California and some blame SoCalGas lack of adequate takeaway capacity failure to provide open access transmission a nd allocation procedures SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that although this is a tight year service commitments will be met and things a re fine and the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going forward that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas issues in California and that CPUC decisions are coming For FERC Staff there are two issues at hand is the problem the mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity and what amount of infrastructu re should be added into and within California andor is it the allocation methodology at a few highlyconstrained delivery points into the state Overall there is basic agreement that there are problems with both The State Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as adequate with just minor changes and enhancements certainly to serve core customers and likely to serve noncore customers Like the LDCs the state representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a difficult year may not bode well for facilities in normal years in the future leaving intrastate capacity stranded Also both agencies ticked o ff a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes that are designed to improve the delivery system According to the CPUC an d CEC demand in the state is not going to explode getting LDC storage b ack up to normal levels should make the difference FERC Staff questioned the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation s of the state LDC systems allocation methods and the availability of firm capacity on SoCalGas in particular There was great concern among Staff about the inability for a noncore customer to contract for specific capaci ty for primary firm service on SoCal The CPUC noted that there is a comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a nd allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system but the Commission has not yet acted on that settlement When asked why the CPUC h as not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year the witness said that there were not three votes The LDCs Only PGE and SoCalGas appeared before FERC Both were adamant that there was adequate capacity for current demand as proven by the lack of curtailments over the past year They also agree that a primary question i s how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity though its general ly held there should be a excess is that for a normal weather year or a dry hydro year For SoCal in particular Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the next five years with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would bypass their system being built directly along interstates pipelines If capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin he wanted to know wh o would pay for the capacity The central policy question for SoCal comes do wn to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin g interstate capacity or customer demand based on contracts SoCal believe s it should respond to the latter However the LDC cites the CPUC as an obstacle for responding to customers and is looking to the CPUC to accept its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for tradable primary capacity rights For PGE the situation is different because it functions very much like an open access interstate pipeline It does not have the allocation and scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system however there is still a mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity PGE like SoCal claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand though they are planning some enhancements They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in planning for uncertainty but in general the northern California LDC is not facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system as nearly all questions focused on SoCals allocation method firm capac ity availability for noncore customers which include industrials and electric generation and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and Wheeler Ridge and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor e interstate capacity SoCal consistently answered that its proposed comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues but the CPUC will not act on it Interstate Pipelines With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table the pipelines call to ar ms was for more capacity into the state Demand projections by the pipeline representatives were vast and optimistic an example being the Sonoran Pipeline prediction of a Bcf shortfall And each pipe can point t o booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas lack of capacity and the major problem of allocation SoCal currently can only offer secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity SoCal responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes allocations The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand forecasts of the LDCs CPUC CEC and the pipelines Others The financial community Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch pointed to a dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv en certainty on returns and the regulatory structure The message was for FER C to stay the course without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat e rules and for California to fix itself especially the CPUC the weakest link Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers rights are protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be stranded There is concern over additional capacity into constrained delivery points that are already pro rationed especially in light of the recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal will be unloaded by bypassing EG They claimed that there are disincentive s in California regulation to SoCals building capacity specifically the Performancebased Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism Und er these programs SoCal gets to keep of peaking service revenues thus giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services SoCal gets to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms Closing Staff Concerns To wrap up FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always discussed and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California However wi th allocation changes at Topock kicking in the problems are moving to Wheeler Ridge There was also a debate over which is the real problem intrastate capa city or intrastate scheduling SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity issue but the mechanism blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling settlement California Generators believe its all about capacity blam e SoCalGas Future Comments Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June Since the SoCal settlement received so much attention and continues to await action by the CPUC should we get supporters of that settlment to file with the FERC stating that this was a fix to some of the problems on SoCals system and the CPUC has sat on it We should find out who is planning to file comments Though much was

Infrastructure conference This memo by Nancy Bagot ETS and Donna Fulton Enron Corp summarizes wha t we heard at yesterdays FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue in California on the gas side The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept to very technical facility and service issues Staff did not allow any discussion of pricing because that would be handled in other forums Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference though some of their staffers were in attendance Like many FERC Technical Conferences the May th conference on California Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming other parties for the situation in the California market Generally interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed both to California and within California and some blame SoCalGas lack of adequate takeaway capacity failure to provide open access transmission a nd allocation procedures SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that although this is a tight year service commitments will be met and things a re fine and the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going forward that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas issues in California and that CPUC decisions are coming For FERC Staff there are two issues at hand is the problem the mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity and what amount of infrastructu re should be added into and within California andor is it the allocation methodology at a few highlyconstrained delivery points into the state Overall there is basic agreement that there are problems with both The State Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as adequate with just minor changes and enhancements certainly to serve core customers and likely to serve noncore customers Like the LDCs the state representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a difficult year may not bode well for facilities in normal years in the future leaving intrastate capacity stranded Also both agencies ticked o ff a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes that are designed to improve the delivery system According to the CPUC an d CEC demand in the state is not going to explode getting LDC storage b ack up to normal levels should make the difference FERC Staff questioned the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation s of the state LDC systems allocation methods and the availability of firm capacity on SoCalGas in particular There was great concern among Staff about the inability for a noncore customer to contract for specific capaci ty for primary firm service on SoCal The CPUC noted that there is a comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a nd allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system but the Commission has not yet acted on that settlement When asked why the CPUC h as not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year the witness said that there were not three votes The LDCs Only PGE and SoCalGas appeared before FERC Both were adamant that there was adequate capacity for current demand as proven by the lack of curtailments over the past year They also agree that a primary question i s how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity though its general ly held there should be a excess is that for a normal weather year or a dry hydro year For SoCal in particular Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the next five years with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would bypass their system being built directly along interstates pipelines If capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin he wanted to know wh o would pay for the capacity The central policy question for SoCal comes do wn to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin g interstate capacity or customer demand based on contracts SoCal believe s it should respond to the latter However the LDC cites the CPUC as an obstacle for responding to customers and is looking to the CPUC to accept its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for tradable primary capacity rights For PGE the situation is different because it functions very much like an open access interstate pipeline It does not have the allocation and scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system however there is still a mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity PGE like SoCal claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand though they are planning some enhancements They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in planning for uncertainty but in general the northern California LDC is not facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system as nearly all questions focused on SoCals allocation method firm capac ity availability for noncore customers which include industrials and electric generation and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and Wheeler Ridge and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor e interstate capacity SoCal consistently answered that its proposed comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues but the CPUC will not act on it Interstate Pipelines With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table the pipelines call to ar ms was for more capacity into the state Demand projections by the pipeline representatives were vast and optimistic an example being the Sonoran Pipeline prediction of a Bcf shortfall And each pipe can point t o booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas lack of capacity and the major problem of allocation SoCal currently can only offer secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity SoCal responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes allocations The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand forecasts of the LDCs CPUC CEC and the pipelines Others The financial community Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch pointed to a dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv en certainty on returns and the regulatory structure The message was for FER C to stay the course without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat e rules and for California to fix itself especially the CPUC the weakest link Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers rights are protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be stranded There is concern over additional capacity into constrained delivery points that are already pro rationed especially in light of the recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal will be unloaded by bypassing EG They claimed that there are disincentive s in California regulation to SoCals building capacity specifically the Performancebased Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism Und er these programs SoCal gets to keep of peaking service revenues thus giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services SoCal gets to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms Closing Staff Concerns To wrap up FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always discussed and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California However wi th allocation changes at Topock kicking in the problems are moving to Wheeler Ridge There was also a debate over which is the real problem intrastate capa city or intrastate scheduling SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity issue but the mechanism blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling settlement California Generators believe its all about capacity blam e SoCalGas Future Comments Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June Since the SoCal settlement received so much attention and continues to await action by the CPUC should we get supporters of that settlment to file with the FERC stating that this was a fix to some of the problems on SoCals system and the CPUC has sat on it We should find out who is planning to file comments Though much was said at the technical conference many speakers brought slides and there was a Cou rt Reporter Commissioners and their staffers will not likely read the whole transcript We could file to emphasize the points that are made in Jennifers gas talking points Future Comments Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June Since the SoCal settlement received so much attention and continues to await
