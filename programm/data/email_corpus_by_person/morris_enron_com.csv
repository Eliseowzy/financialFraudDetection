Reserve will ease by only bp next Tuesday At this stage Lehman Brothers economists still think the odds favor a bp cut given the underlying weakness in the economy particularly in hightech and

the upfront selling cycle which commences May with presentations from the major Networks lasting through May The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market Ad buyers must be careful not to look at the current economic environment as a proxy for the future Based on this premise there may be upside to our estimated decline in upfront sales based on inventory sales with low to mid single digit price increases In our opinion VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this years upfront given that improved ratings in the key demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM

reasons that we the Local Guys are pretty exited about the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserves is that we think it will make a real difference Over the last few months there has been considerable talk that while capital spending especially information technology spending has been budgeted by corporations for it has to a large extent been frozen as the economic uncertainty had taken a grip of corporate comptrollers We believe that this latest rate cut and possible future cuts could well spur greater corporate confidence as well as spur greater liquidity from the capital markets and thus free up already allocated budgets for corporate spending The year US TBond yield is The year yield is The year is trading at Spot crude oil is trading at pb Natural Gas Henry Hub is trading at pmcf AD
