JDSU follows from E quityAlertcom New Report Analyzes How to Succeed in the Integrated Op tics Business With Bookham Technology and Lightwave Microsystems as Example s CHARLOTTESVILLE Va Oct PRNewswire via COMTEX Communica tions Industry Researchers Inc CIR a leading market research and indus try analyst firm announces a new report that analyzes key success factors in the market for integrated optical components and shows how two relativel y small companies Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology have been able to emerge as leaders in this business along with giants Agere Al catel JDS Uniphase and Nortel This new report considers the managerial t echnological marketing and financial aspects of these two companies penet ration of the optical integration marketplace Why Integrated Optics is a Big Boys Business CIR believes that for the time being at least becau se manufacturing knowhow is so much a part of the secret sauce of integrat ed optical components companies these companies must typically own their o wn plants Factories cost big bucks and CIR believes that it takes million in resources to be a player in the optical integration game As a result the market for integrated optics is going to be dominated by the l argest component manufacturers especially Agere Alcatel JDS Uniphase and Nortel Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology are two smaller co mpanies that are focused on optical integration and both have crossed the million funding barrier by a substantial margin The new CIR report sta tes that Lightwave Microsystems initial success has been largely due to ch arismatic leadership while Bookhams can be traced to its close initial rel ationship with Nortel However the current photonic nuclear winter means that the stability of both companies customer bases is uncertain Orders from the largest equipment companies have declined rapidly and many equipme nt startups seem likely to disappear in a massive shakeout in the next yea r The good news for Bookham investors is that Bookham currently gets most of its business from Lucent Nortel Fujitsu and Marconi and despite their current woes these companies are most likely to survive the downturn Alth ough it does not reveal customer information Lightwave Microsystems also a ppears to be focusing its efforts on making inroads with the largest equipm ent companies and CIR research indicates that it has already achieved a sig nificant mindshare with these customers More Ambition Needed CIR beli eves that if Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham are to continue to be succe ssful they will have to be more ambitious in seeking competitive advanta ge in their core technologies and integrated product strategies Lightwav e Microsystems is using a version of silicaonsilicon integration technolo gy However the new CIR report notes that this approach is being used by m any other companies and so offers no longterm competitive advantage to thi s company Indeed the new CIR report provides evidence that the silicaon silicon processes may have significant technical limitations which may act ually restrict Lightwave Microsystems opportunities in the future And whi le acknowledging that Bookhams allsilicon approach may have more longter m potential the report also says that both companies product road maps fo r integrated optical products have been somewhat timid they both appear to be focused on offering combinations of a MUXDEMUX and Variable Optical Attenuator The report points out that the market for such products is quit e limited It says that if the integrated optics market is ever going to ta ke off all companies operating in this space are going to have to make goo d on their currently vague promises of more exciting integrated optics prod ucts with additional functionality and costperformance improvements The report concludes with an analysis of Bookhams and Lightwave Microsystems future prospects and strategic options including the possibility that the y may be acquired The report is available starting at US and may be purchased via CIRs web site indexcfmloc Dpagesopticalwatchcomponents or by contacting Robert Nolan via email
