regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP With consumers howling about unexpectedly high electric bills this summer Californias Public Utility Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San Diego residents by percent so that most customers will pay no more than per month through January By a margin the commission also approved a rate cut for small businesses and school districts resulting in estimated bills of a month for customers that dont exceed strict usage limits of kilowatt hours This isnt going to help anybody muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan Bauman as she waved a electricity bill showing one of her two businesses used kilowatt hours in July PUC Commissioner Henry Duque who drafted the proposal said it provides some relief while encouraging energy conservation since customers who exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully inadequate We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging said San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob We are going to die unless we get more help The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price controls through and lowered bills by percent from current levels Ed Guiles CEO of San Diego Gas Electric Co said the alternative would have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs With interest those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning in But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego customers as much as million after Guiles said This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices Guiles said Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the higher rates now or in the future The proposals are really just a ruse They move the burden from the consumers checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Santa Monica watchdog The deregulation of the states billion electrical power industry imposed under a complex law that phases in the effects from south to north was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand has outstripped electricity supplies due to a growing population booming hightech economy and less electricity available from neighboring states that havent deregulated their systems A sweltering summer in much of California hasnt helped and cost hikes and continuing power shortages that caused rolling brownouts in the San Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal Mondays action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov Gray Davis who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that have sparked outrage in Californias second largest city and fears in other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as early as next year Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDGE have seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were deregulated in June Jacob and other San Diegoarea politicians on hand at San Franciscos hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law proposing to revert rates to prices The proposal doesnt specify who would pay for the rollback Other critics said the PUCs rate limits wont help elderly and sick people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running your refrigerator but basically what were telling people is dont turn on your air conditioner said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who wanted the steeper rate cut that failed Monday The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to kilowatts per month About percent of homes in San Diego fall under the cap estimated Duque The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation On August the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was per megawatt hour up from per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year said Wood The estimated cap for residential customers will remain in effect through January and then increase to a projected cap through December The projected cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and school districts will increase to per month after January Under deregulation private utilities were required to sell off their power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers and buy power on the open market paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain about deregulation and few new power plants are in the works On the Net California PUC California ISO Energy Department electricity statistics North American Electric Reliability Council Utility Consumers Action Network Copyright AP

million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco

skyrockets under rule easing wholesale controls By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Dec Some wholesale electricity prices on Californias Power Exchange nearly tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled while officials declared another electric emergency In the first full business day under new sharply disputed trading rules aimed at averting blackouts prices of electricity on the Power Exchange where the bulk of Californias electricity is bought and sold surged far above Fridays per megawatt hour The days first PX auction produced average prices of per megawatt hour and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of One year ago the average PX price was about Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said Prices were crazy yesterday and theyre crazier today Arredondo said This will be the most expensive month ever in California Im sure of it The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and strong electric demand throughout the West for Mondays price runup but critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have backfired At the ISOs request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday gave permission to lift a price cap and replace it with a requirement that power sellers who set prices higher than must explain them later The ISO said the changes would improve the grids stability by attracting more power to California repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs and reducing lastminute deals The rules were immediately attacked by Gov Gray Davis and state regulators who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other problems Thats just what happened Monday said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Price gouging has reached a new level he said Its not surprising Its exactly what the governor predicted In addition a glitch in the way the ISO and the PX use twostage electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will temporarily spur more lastminute trading instead of less according to power plant owners and the ISO ISO officials who have long warned that lastminute deals can hurt the stability of the electric grid said the effect will be minimal but Power Exchange officials predict it could be massive The test will come today In an effort to solve the problem the PX late Monday asked FERC to make another emergency change in trading rules lifting caps on the second round of power auctions which are used to set congestion pricing The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers almost universally the utilities which then turn around and supply Californians power The ISO was created to control the transmission grid but it has emerged as the buyer of about onefourth of Californias power when stability problems arise and it then resells that power to utilities Meanwhile the ISO declared another stage two electric emergency Monday afternoon the th since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

woes David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by Californias efforts to deregulate the states electricity market We think you made a terrible mess of it he said And now he pointed out Californias troubles have become a headache for other states as well with no end to the problem in sight

inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis By Pete Wilson Published June The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand Five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer including thenLt Gov Gray Davis California enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some percent Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and keep in California all the jobs that it would produce And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in and the defeat that year by California voters of Prop which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation The total megawattage of the filings for doubled that for After the effective date March of the deregulation legislation AB and the defeat of Proposition November removing the threat of repeal the total for was double that of exceeding the MW mark in alone Just look at the filings for and in the California Energy Commission graph above Far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the Davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by mid applications to build new power plants that promised to add megawatts to Californias power supply Thats why I signed it I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB just as I and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation No one could have anticipated in the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the West warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by The reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis Now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis Governor Davis has been quoted as saying If I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes Sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable As a result California bonds have suffered two downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs He has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him then I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction Pete Wilson is the former governor of California You can see this story at voicesnewsvoiceshtml

since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco

regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP With consumers howling about unexpectedly high electric bills this summer Californias Public Utility Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San Diego residents by percent so that most customers will pay no more than per month through January By a margin the commission also approved a rate cut for small businesses and school districts resulting in estimated bills of a month for customers that dont exceed strict usage limits of kilowatt hours This isnt going to help anybody muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan Bauman as she waved a electricity bill showing one of her two businesses used kilowatt hours in July PUC Commissioner Henry Duque who drafted the proposal said it provides some relief while encouraging energy conservation since customers who exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully inadequate We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging said San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob We are going to die unless we get more help The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price controls through and lowered bills by percent from current levels Ed Guiles CEO of San Diego Gas Electric Co said the alternative would have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs With interest those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning in But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego customers as much as million after Guiles said This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices Guiles said Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the higher rates now or in the future The proposals are really just a ruse They move the burden from the consumers checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Santa Monica watchdog The deregulation of the states billion electrical power industry imposed under a complex law that phases in the effects from south to north was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand has outstripped electricity supplies due to a growing population booming hightech economy and less electricity available from neighboring states that havent deregulated their systems A sweltering summer in much of California hasnt helped and cost hikes and continuing power shortages that caused rolling brownouts in the San Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal Mondays action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov Gray Davis who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that have sparked outrage in Californias second largest city and fears in other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as early as next year Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDGE have seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were deregulated in June Jacob and other San Diegoarea politicians on hand at San Franciscos hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law proposing to revert rates to prices The proposal doesnt specify who would pay for the rollback Other critics said the PUCs rate limits wont help elderly and sick people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running your refrigerator but basically what were telling people is dont turn on your air conditioner said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who wanted the steeper rate cut that failed Monday The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to kilowatts per month About percent of homes in San Diego fall under the cap estimated Duque The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation On August the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was per megawatt hour up from per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year said Wood The estimated cap for residential customers will remain in effect through January and then increase to a projected cap through December The projected cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and school districts will increase to per month after January Under deregulation private utilities were required to sell off their power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers and buy power on the open market paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain about deregulation and few new power plants are in the

woes David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by Californias efforts to deregulate the states electricity market We think you made a terrible mess of it he said And now he pointed out Californias troubles have become a headache for other states as well with no end to the problem in sight

inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis By Pete Wilson Published June The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand Five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer including thenLt Gov Gray Davis California enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some percent Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and keep in California all the jobs that it would produce And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in and the defeat that year by California voters of Prop which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation The total megawattage of the filings for doubled that for After the effective date March of the deregulation legislation AB and the defeat of Proposition November removing the threat of repeal the total for was double that of exceeding the MW mark in alone Just look at the filings for and in the California Energy Commission graph above Far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the Davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by mid applications to build new power plants that promised to add megawatts to Californias power supply Thats why I signed it I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB just as I and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation No one could have anticipated in the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the West warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by The reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis Now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis Governor Davis has been quoted as saying If I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes Sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable As a result California bonds have suffered two downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs He has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him then I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and

regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP With consumers howling about unexpectedly high electric bills this summer Californias Public Utility Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San Diego residents by percent so that most customers will pay no more than per month through January By a margin the commission also approved a rate cut for small businesses and school districts resulting in estimated bills of a month for customers that dont exceed strict usage limits of kilowatt hours This isnt going to help anybody muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan Bauman as she waved a electricity bill showing one of her two businesses used kilowatt hours in July PUC Commissioner Henry Duque who drafted the proposal said it provides some relief while encouraging energy conservation since customers who exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully inadequate We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging said San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob We are going to die unless we get more help The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price controls through and lowered bills by percent from current levels Ed Guiles CEO of San Diego Gas Electric Co said the alternative would have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs With interest those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning in But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego customers as much as million after Guiles said This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices Guiles said Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the higher rates now or in the future The proposals are really just a ruse They move the burden from the consumers checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Santa Monica watchdog The deregulation of the states billion electrical power industry imposed under a complex law that phases in the effects from south to north was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand has outstripped electricity supplies due to a growing population booming hightech economy and less electricity available from neighboring states that havent deregulated their systems A sweltering summer in much of California hasnt helped and cost hikes and continuing power shortages that caused rolling brownouts in the San Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal Mondays action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov Gray Davis who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that have sparked outrage in Californias second largest city and fears in other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as early as next year Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDGE have seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were deregulated in June Jacob and other San Diegoarea politicians on hand at San Franciscos hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law proposing to revert rates to prices The proposal doesnt specify who would pay for the rollback Other critics said the PUCs rate limits wont help elderly and sick people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running your refrigerator but basically what were telling people is dont turn on your air conditioner said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who wanted the steeper rate cut that failed Monday The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to kilowatts per month About percent of homes in San Diego fall under the cap estimated Duque The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation On August the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was per megawatt hour up from per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year said Wood The estimated cap for residential customers will remain in effect through January and then increase to a projected cap through December The projected cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and school districts will increase to per month after January Under deregulation private utilities were required to sell off their power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers and buy power on the open market paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain about deregulation and few new power plants are in the

million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco

skyrockets under rule easing wholesale controls By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Dec Some wholesale electricity prices on Californias Power Exchange nearly tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled while officials declared another electric emergency In the first full business day under new sharply disputed trading rules aimed at averting blackouts prices of electricity on the Power Exchange where the bulk of Californias electricity is bought and sold surged far above Fridays per megawatt hour The days first PX auction produced average prices of per megawatt hour and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of One year ago the average PX price was about Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said Prices were crazy yesterday and theyre crazier today Arredondo said This will be the most expensive month ever in California Im sure of it The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and strong electric demand throughout the West for Mondays price runup but critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have backfired At the ISOs request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday gave permission to lift a price cap and replace it with a requirement that power sellers who set prices higher than must explain them later The ISO said the changes would improve the grids stability by attracting more power to California repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs and reducing lastminute deals The rules were immediately attacked by Gov Gray Davis and state regulators who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other problems Thats just what happened Monday said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Price gouging has reached a new level he said Its not surprising Its exactly what the governor predicted In addition a glitch in the way the ISO and the PX use twostage electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will temporarily spur more lastminute trading instead of less according to power plant owners and the ISO ISO officials who have long warned that lastminute deals can hurt the stability of the electric grid said the effect will be minimal but Power Exchange officials predict it could be massive The test will come today In an effort to solve the problem the PX late Monday asked FERC to make another emergency change in trading rules lifting caps on the second round of power auctions which are used to set congestion pricing The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers almost universally the utilities which then turn around and supply Californians power The ISO was created to control the transmission grid but it has emerged as the buyer of about onefourth of Californias power when stability problems arise and it then resells that power to utilities Meanwhile the ISO declared another stage two electric emergency Monday afternoon the th since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

woes David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by

forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the

states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with

regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP With consumers howling about unexpectedly high electric bills this summer Californias Public Utility Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San Diego residents by percent so that most customers will pay no more than per month through January By a margin the commission also approved a rate cut for small businesses and school districts resulting in estimated bills of a month for customers that dont exceed strict usage limits of kilowatt hours This isnt going to help anybody muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan Bauman as she waved a electricity bill showing one of her two businesses used kilowatt hours in July PUC Commissioner Henry Duque who drafted the proposal said it provides some relief while encouraging energy conservation since customers who exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully inadequate We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging said San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob We are going to die unless we get more help The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price controls through and lowered bills by percent from current levels Ed Guiles CEO of San Diego Gas Electric Co said the alternative would have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs With interest those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning in But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego customers as much as million after Guiles said This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices Guiles said Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the higher rates now or in the future The proposals are really just a ruse They move the burden from the consumers checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Santa Monica watchdog The deregulation of the states billion electrical power industry imposed under a complex law that phases in the effects from south to north was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand has outstripped electricity supplies due to a growing population booming hightech economy and less electricity available from neighboring states that havent deregulated their systems A sweltering summer in much of California hasnt helped and cost hikes and continuing power shortages that caused rolling brownouts in the San Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal Mondays action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov Gray Davis who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that have sparked outrage in Californias second largest city and fears in other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as early as next year Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDGE have seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were deregulated in June Jacob and other San Diegoarea politicians on hand at San Franciscos hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law proposing to revert rates to prices The proposal doesnt specify who would pay for the rollback Other critics said the PUCs rate limits wont help elderly and sick people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running your refrigerator but basically what were telling people is dont turn on your air conditioner said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who wanted the steeper rate cut that failed Monday The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to kilowatts per month About percent of homes in San Diego fall under the cap estimated Duque The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation On August the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was per megawatt hour up from per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year said Wood The estimated cap for residential customers will remain in effect through January and then increase to a projected cap through December The projected cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and school districts will increase to per month after January Under deregulation private utilities were required to sell off their power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers and buy power on the open market paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain about deregulation and few new power plants are in the

forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him then I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction Pete Wilson is the former governor of California You can see this story at voicesnewsvoiceshtml

regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP With consumers howling about unexpectedly high electric bills this summer Californias Public Utility Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San Diego residents by percent so that most customers will pay no more than per month through January By a margin the commission also approved a rate cut for small businesses and school districts resulting in estimated bills of a month for customers that dont exceed strict usage limits of kilowatt hours This isnt going to help anybody muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan Bauman as she waved a electricity bill showing one of her two businesses used kilowatt hours in July PUC Commissioner Henry Duque who drafted the proposal said it provides some relief while encouraging energy conservation since customers who exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully inadequate We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging said San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob We are going to die unless we get more help The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price controls through and lowered bills by percent from current levels Ed Guiles CEO of San Diego Gas Electric Co said the alternative would have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs With interest those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning in But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego customers as much as million after Guiles said This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices Guiles said Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the higher rates now or in the future The proposals are really just a ruse They move the burden from the consumers checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Santa Monica watchdog The deregulation of the states billion electrical power industry imposed under a complex law that phases in the effects from south to north was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition But demand has outstripped electricity supplies due to a growing population booming hightech economy and less electricity available from neighboring states that havent deregulated their systems A sweltering summer in much of California hasnt helped and cost hikes and continuing power shortages that caused rolling brownouts in the San Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal Mondays action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov Gray Davis who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that have sparked outrage in Californias second largest city and fears in other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as early as next year Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDGE have seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were deregulated in June Jacob and other San Diegoarea politicians on hand at San Franciscos hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law proposing to revert rates to prices The proposal doesnt specify who would pay for the rollback Other critics said the PUCs rate limits wont help elderly and sick people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running your refrigerator but basically what were telling people is dont turn on your air conditioner said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who wanted the steeper rate cut that failed Monday The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to kilowatts per month About percent of homes in San Diego fall under the cap estimated Duque The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation On August the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was per megawatt hour up from per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year said Wood The estimated cap for residential customers will remain in effect through January and then increase to a projected cap through December The projected cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and school districts will increase to per month after January Under deregulation private utilities were required to sell off their power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers and buy power on the open market paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain about deregulation and few new power plants are in the

million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco

skyrockets under rule easing wholesale controls By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Dec Some wholesale electricity prices on Californias Power Exchange nearly tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled while officials declared another electric emergency In the first full business day under new sharply disputed trading rules aimed at averting blackouts prices of electricity on the Power Exchange where the bulk of Californias electricity is bought and sold surged far above Fridays per megawatt hour The days first PX auction produced average prices of per megawatt hour and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of One year ago the average PX price was about Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said Prices were crazy yesterday and theyre crazier today Arredondo said This will be the most expensive month ever in California Im sure of it The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and strong electric demand throughout the West for Mondays price runup but critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have backfired At the ISOs request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday gave permission to lift a price cap and replace it with a requirement that power sellers who set prices higher than must explain them later The ISO said the changes would improve the grids stability by attracting more power to California repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs and reducing lastminute deals The rules were immediately attacked by Gov Gray Davis and state regulators who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other problems Thats just what happened Monday said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Price gouging has reached a new level he said Its not surprising Its exactly what the governor predicted In addition a glitch in the way the ISO and the PX use twostage electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will temporarily spur more lastminute trading instead of less according to power plant owners and the ISO ISO officials who have long warned that lastminute deals can hurt the stability of the electric grid said the effect will be minimal but Power Exchange officials predict it could be massive The test will come today In an effort to solve the problem the PX late Monday asked FERC to make another emergency change in trading rules lifting caps on the second round of power auctions which are used to set congestion pricing The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers almost universally the utilities which then turn around and supply Californians power The ISO was created to control the transmission grid but it has emerged as the buyer of about onefourth of Californias power when stability problems arise and it then resells that power to utilities Meanwhile the ISO declared another stage two electric emergency Monday afternoon the th since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by Californias efforts to deregulate the states electricity market We think you made a terrible mess of it he said And now he pointed out Californias troubles have become a headache for other states as well with no end to the

inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis By Pete Wilson Published June The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand Five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer including thenLt Gov Gray Davis California enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some percent Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and keep in California all the jobs that it would produce And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in and the defeat that year by California voters of Prop which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation The total megawattage of the filings for doubled that for After the effective date March of the deregulation legislation AB and the defeat of Proposition November removing the threat of repeal the total for was double that of exceeding the MW mark in alone Just look at the filings for and in the California Energy Commission graph above Far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the Davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by mid applications to build new power plants that promised to add megawatts to Californias power supply Thats why I signed it I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB just as I and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation No one could have anticipated in the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the West warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by The reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis Now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis Governor Davis has been quoted as saying If I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes Sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable As a result California bonds have suffered two downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs He has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election

to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction Pete Wilson is the former governor of California You can see this story at voicesnewsvoiceshtml

Forwarded by Joseph AlamoNAEnron on AM Joseph Alamo AM To Miyung BusterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Power brokering Loretta Lynch has landed in the energy spotlight as the firm hand at PUCs helm April The Orange County Register Power brokering Loretta Lynch has landed in the energy spotlight as the firm hand at PUCs helm April By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO At the eye of Californias darkening electricity storm is Loretta Lynch the selfdescribed smalltown girl who became the top utility regulator in the nations largest state Her decision last week to push through a doubledigit rate increase affecting million people shocked many in the state and drew fire from powerful interests including consumer groups the public the utilities Wall Street and Gov Gray Davis The Yaletrained lawyer says she acted independently of the governor who appointed her president of the Public Utilities Commission I go my way and decide the issues based on the best evidence period Lynch said last week in a lunchtime interview in a coffee shop across the street from the Capitol All the scenarios every set of assumptions pointed to the fact that we needed to increase rates There was absolute evidence and strong analyses and we went forward Absent a rate increase she said there might not be enough revenue to back an upcoming bond issue the state desperately needs to steady the energy market As much as Davis himself the yearold Lynch is fast becoming a target for Republicans who see in Californias energy crisis an opportunity to make gains in the elections In a report to the Republicans in the Assembly veteran political consultant Sal Russo described Lynch as a formidable foe a master of damage control a hardnosed political warrior experienced in scapegoat politics Most capable in years She acknowledges shes in a political pressure cooker I accept that I deal with that I dont go to the gym as often as I used to because the days are so long but I still go and I deal with the tension I love hiking and that helps Longtime consumer advocate Michael Shames agrees Lynch is on the hot seat The president of the PUC is always a voodoo doll that people stick with pins intended to hurt other people said Shames who has been involved in utility issues in San Diego for two decades I think shes being stuck with pins right now The question is whether she can stand the pain She is probably the most capable commissioner to head the agency in years but shes got a thankless task and shes finding it a tough job Smalltown girl Scrappy and voluble Lynch proudly describes herself as a smalltown girl from Independence Mo I come from a big family an IrishCatholic family I have five sisters and the only way you went to college where I grew up was on a scholarship She says her family is tight knit and she speaks frequently by phone with her sisters including Cecelia Lynch a political science professor at the University of California Irvine A debater in high school Loretta Lynch left Independence we lived about a mile from Harry Truman and went to the University of Southern California From there she went to Yale Law School She returned to Los Angeles and worked as a lawyer at the Legal Aid Foundation which provides legal help for the poor She then served eight years as a staff attorney handling civil litigation in the San Francisco law firm of Keker Van Nest In between she found time to clerk for a federal appellate justice and work on four major political campaigns including Bill Clintons presidential race Dianne Feinsteins first US Senate bid and John Van de Kamps failed gubernatorial campaign A Democrat from a family of Democrats Lynch stayed with her roots What did she learn in the political wars Dont take anything personally and think before you speak she said She served briefly as Gov Gray Davis research and policy director and since May she has headed the PUC an enormously powerful agency with employees sweeping authority over telecommunications and electricity and a direct effect on the wallets of millions of Californians She had little or no experience in energy regulation before her appointment to the ayear job Where I come from there arent a lot of people making sixfigure salaries she notes Obscure no longer Once scarcely known the PUC is at the center of Californias electricity crisis And Lynch is at the center of the PUC The PUC was one of those little agencies with enormous power that nobody watches she said But it now faces the glare of daily media attention and the suspicion and sometimes anger of the public Its decisions are watched across the nation and a major action such as its unanimous decision to approve an asmuch as percent boost in electricity bills can rock Wall Street Lynch who is single says she tries to conserve electricity And she says she has not suffered through blackouts although several friends have I hear from them every time it happens I hear from people who want me to know theyve had a bad experience Real people experiencing real burdens and its important to remember that Davis influence Despite Davis welldeserved reputation as a micromanager and his oftrepeated statements that his appointees are there to represent his thinking Lynch avers that her actions are independent of the governor and declined to say whether she consulted him in advance Davis for his part says Lynch did not consult him before she pushed for the rate increase despite strong suspicions among Democrats and Republicans alike including many who have known Davis for years that she deliberately took the political heat for the governor Lynch believes three things led to Californias electricity crisis an earlier deregulation decision by a Republicandominated PUC a poorly drafted deregulation law and most of all outright gouging and gaming by electricity wholesalers It all comes back to those wholesalers she said As she waits to order a sandwich a woman smiles approaches and gives her hug Hang in there Loretta Hang in there the woman says suspiciously eyeing a nearby reporter with a notebook Not a problem Lynch says

Dale Kasler and John Hill Bee Staff Writers Published April Alarmed by the drain on Californias treasury from more than billion of electricity purchases a leading Wall Street credit agency lowered its rati ng on state bonds Tuesday Standard Poors downgraded Californias credit rating by two notches a move that will increase the states borrowing costs and illustrates a growi ng fear that the states power expenditures could mushroom during a summer of blackouts and price spikes Although the state remains creditworthy SP said it has less confidence in Californias ability to repay its debts It said the state could be downgraded further if electricity purchases spiral out of control and the economy suffers because of blackouts This reflects the mounting uncertainty and the cost to the state of the power purchases said SP analyst Steven Zimmermann The state is still strong its just not as strong going forward Bond ratings are a benchmark of a states finances and California official s have been proud of their ability to restore the states ratings since they bottomed out during the recession and budget deficits of the mids SP s downgrade is the first for California since July and comes as a slowdo wn in the hightech industry adds to the budgetary anxiety caused by electrici ty costs Still Gov Gray Davis office downplayed the significance of SPs decisio n Californias economy is still fundamentally strong period said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar We expect that in California will continue t o lead the nation in economic growth and job creation SP lowered California from AA to Aplus status That means California s debtpayment ability has been reduced from very strong to still strong but somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of the changes in circumstances and economic conditions While it wont directly hamper Davis plan for solving the energy crisis t he downgrade increases the pressure on Davis to issue billion to billi on worth of bonds this summer as part of his rescue package The bonds are intended to replenish the state treasury as well as finance future power purchases Since midJanuary the state has committed billion to buy electricity for troubled Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison The commitment has chewed up a significant portion of a budget surplus estimated by state Treasurer Phil Angelides at nearly billion Davis and other state officials have pegged the surplus at billion Either way its clear that the power expenditures have left Wall Street an d many state officials nervous SP and other rating agencies have had California on a ratings watch for some time signifying that a downgrade was possible The fact is that the states credit rating and financial strength will continue to be in jeopardy until the states general fund is repaid for energy costs said Angelides whos responsible for selling the bonds We have to get the general fund out of the business of purchasing energy The budgetary drain will begin to

g et the bond offering rolling The Legislature already authorized the bonds but Angelides said it must do so again because PGE and Edison are challenging the formula the state has developed for bond repayment The bond will be repaid with money from a rat e hike passed by state regulators but PGE and Edison say the repayment formula will siphon too much money from their coffers Angelides said lawmakers must quickly pass the new bill which requires a twothirds majority or he might miss a makeorbreak May deadline for closing on a crucial billion bridge loan That loan is designed to tid e the state over until the bonds are sold later this summer But the lenders wont fork over the funds until theyre assured the bonds will be sold because the state will use the bond proceeds in part to pay off that loan he said Ironically the sale of those bonds wont be hurt by the SP downgrade because customer revenue instead of taxpayer dollars are being used to pay them off analysts said Whats important for the bonds is how the utility rates are structured t o pay them off said analyst Susan Abbott of Moodys Inc in New York But the downgrade will raise the interest rate on a host of other bonds issued by the state in the coming months The likely increase is as much as onequarter of percent said chief economist Ted Gibson of the state Department of Finance With the state authorized to sell billion worth of general obligation bonds the downgrade could add million to million in borrowing cos ts over the life of those bonds Angelides said The SP action also could raise a red flag to anyone thinking of investing in a public or privatesector project in California It will create perception issues about who we are and where we are in term s of the economy of the state Angelides said

Davis pushes for plants Bee Capitol Bureau Published April John Stevens Gov Gray Davis staff director and top energy adviser is leaving the governors office at the end of the week Davis announced Tuesday Stevens of Carmichael joined the administration a year ago as staff director after working years as a top staffer in the Legislature including a stint as chief of staff to former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa He is the second top Davis adviser to leave in the past two weeks as the Democratic governor struggles to deal with Californias energy woes Like Phil Trounstine the governors communications director who announced his resignation two weeks ago Stevens said he needed more time with his family Its an immense issue he said of the energy crisis Ive given what I c an to it and I need to take a break Davis called Stevens one of the most dedicated and loyal people that Ive ever had working for me but acknowledged long hours and intensity to ok its toll This is tough work This wears people out Davis said Hes so selfdriv en that he needs a break but I venture a guess that down the road hell be willing to come back and help us in some meaningful way on this energy situation Davis also announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to head a Generation Implementation Task Force intended to speed up permitting and constructing power plants Sklar was the Clinton

proposal can get out of committee By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau Published April WASHINGTON West Coast senators formally introduced legislation Tuesday t o temporarily cap wholesale electric rates and expressed hope that their proposal to ease the huge runup in energy prices might clear the committee and make it to a vote on the Senate floor I think we are very close to having the votes in committee Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee tha t has jurisdiction over the bill I am taking nothing for granted but the committee is There are Democrats and Republicans on the committee including Feinstein and the other primary sponsor of the bill Oregon Sen Gordon Smith Smith a Republican is the swing vote Feinstein said the committee chairman Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska has shown an increasing willingness to help her and Smith move the legislation though some differences remain He Murkowski has told me hed like to help Feinstein said I think we are very close to a markup and this could move quickly Murkowski did not rule out price caps but said he thought the bill sacrific ed longterm solutions for shortterm gains I have concerns about the proposal put forward today and the impact it may have in distorting the market he said It is time to address the underlying causes not just the symptoms Feinsteins comments came at a news conference during which she Smith Washington state Democratic Sens Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and New Mexico Sen Jeff Bingaman the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee unveiled details of the bill and criticized the Bush administration and federal regulators for failing to take action to cap rates If approved by Congress and signed by President Bush the bill would give t he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission days to impose price caps or set up a costbased rate structure that would allow electricity generators to recove r their costs and earn a fair return The controls would apply in Western states including California Oregon and Washington Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives The lawmakers said the price controls would remain in effect until March when they said enough new generating plants will have come on line to overcome the Wests current electricity shortage Under federal law FERC has the authority to ensure wholesale rates are jus t and reasonable Feinstein said that during a warm day this summer California may fall megawatts short of meeting demand and on a hot day with air conditioners cranked up there could be a megawatt shortfall Feinstein said that in California utilities paid billion for electricity in more than billion and according to some estimates the price tag could reach billion this year There has been a very strong element of price gouging in this Feinstein said We should not have to pass legislation to compensate for a federal agency not doing its job Murray said adding that Northwest utilities were payin g the highest prices in the country for nextday delivery of wholesale power This bill will bring the market under control until new generation comes on line Cantwell who is also a committee member said wholesale rates have risen fold over the past several months resulting in thousands of layoffs in the region and the shutdown of the aluminum industry We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawe d and easily manipulated power market to wreak havoc on our economy and quali ty of life Cantwell said The Bonneville Power Administration has indicated it may have to raise its wholesale rates by percent this fall as it is forced to buy power on expensive spot markets because a severe drought in the Pacific Northwest ha s reduced electricity production at the regions vast hydropower system BPA supplies percent of the Northwests wholesale electricity Smith said that as a Republican he was initially reluctant to support pri ce control and would have preferred the market sort out its own problems But he said Hardnosed business practices that generate big profits are not always good politics Its a mistake to defend a system that some can game to make incredible profits The Oregon senator said he knew his decision to sponsor the bill was not wellreceived at the White House I know Im not making any friends down the street he said Its importa nt to keep this bipartisan and Im not going to attack the Bush administration Both Smith and Feinstein said a FERC staff proposal to cap wholesale electr ic rates in California when rolling blackouts are imminent falls well short of whats needed FERC will consider the proposal at a meeting today California is not the only state affected said Smith This is not a California problem alone Feinstein said the proposal was inadequate Im not sure that is the right way to go she said The only reason they are considering action is we are putting the heat on them The Bees Les Blumenthal can be reached at or Energy price gouging might end up felony By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published April Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price gouging a felony punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time tha t could be subject to the states controversial three strikes law The measure sponsored by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante would punish companies that sell electricity or natural gas in California at unjust or unreasonab le rates There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from California to five companies mostly in Texas Bustamante said If what theyre doing isnt illegal it ought to be Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday it already has generated opposition from Republican lawmakers and constitutional questions from legal experts Several aspects of the bill AB x are unresolved and could change But the intent will remain the same and energy companies that take advanta ge of Californians will still face significant penalties said the bills author Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments a corporation or a person with decisionmaking authority at the corporation would be found guilty of a felony if they collude or conspire to manipulat e the market to achieve unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity or natur al gas A state or federal regulatory agency such as the Federal Energy Regulato ry Commission would determine whether rates were unjust or unreasonable If that happened the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state attorney general or local district attorneys In addition if found guilty companies would be forced to pay restitution and could face fines as high as percent of their gross corporate assets Lawmakers are debating whether to make the felony a three strikes offense which requires years to life sentences for some people convicted of thre e felonies Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill Cardoza said its not likely to show up in the final version While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin g money from a bank were going to have to figure out a little bit different way of dealing with it he said Even without the three strikes provision the bill raises certain constitutional issues said Clark Kelso a professor at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento For instance he said its not clear whether the state can legally base a fine on an outofstate companys gross assets And the measure which requires a twothirds vote for passage already has generated Republican opposition To the extent this bill is onerous toward power producers it may deter th em from selling here rather than risk fines and prison said James Fisfis a spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus We havent seen the details but it sounds like it may be a piece of legislation that goes too far The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Dan Walters Its time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis Published April Gov Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that hes on top of the states energy crisis and as he said at one gathering last week in three years this problem will be a distant memory Fat chance All major aspect s of the situation are growing worse not better minute by minute Politicians took over the crisis in January as the states major utilities exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit Davis began what he said then would be a shortterm emergency program of power purchases to keep electrons flowing into homes and businesses From that moment forward the situation has steadily deteriorated moving toward a threepronged disaster severe summer blackouts the bankruptcy of the utilities and sharply escalating power bills With the bankruptcy filin g by Pacific Gas and Electric Co and decisions by Davis and the state Public Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates two of the three negative scenarios are now in place And everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl e The Davis strategy if there is one is to continue the states massive pow er purchases while negotiating longerterm and presumably cheaper supply contracts encourage conservation help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch Currently the governor is touting his deal with Edison International pare nt company of Southern California Edison to sell its portion of the power gri d and is working on a similar deal with Sempra the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric But PGEs bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of the cashforgrid concept and legislators particularly Davis fellow Democrats are very skeptical of the Edison deal Clearly Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PGE made its bankruptcy filing in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latte r action but its provisions are being labeled a bailout by critics It place s only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing th e profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts Meanwhile the state is spending by Davis own account about million a day or billionplus a month on spot power purchases paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level An d the futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jum p percent by midsummer higher prices and greater purchases could increase the drain on the state treasury to as much as billion a month State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a bridge lo an to relieve pressure on the states rapidly vanishing reserves but Wall Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of whats happenin g and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature Meanwhile bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities Davis for some reason is unwilling to declare this situation the emergenc y that it is truly becoming one that could take a toll on human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners respirators and traffic lights He insists on issuing his periodic and wholly unrealistic assurances that things will turn out all right even declaring to reporters on Tuesday We think well have this thing licked by the end of fall Its time for someone the governor preferably but someone to lay ou t for Californians exactly whats happening the downside financial and power supply risks and whats being done to deal with the looming disaster facin g this state Its time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans The Bees Dan Walters can

Legislature poor marks for handling the electricity crisis downgrading state bonds because of the drain on the state treasury and warning of longterm damage to the state economy The bad news from Standard Poors came as state Treasurer Phil Angelides urged the Legislature to pass a bill this week needed to begin repaying the state general fund with a bond of billion or more The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over years From a small problem that could have been solved in a short period of time this is escalating into a big problem said David Hitchcock of Standard Poors Even if they issue revenue bonds it could stay with them for a lo ng period of time Standard Poors lowered its rating on state of California general obligation bonds from AA to A which means it will cost the state more to borrow money The firm left California on credit watch with a negative outlook a ranking applied after the state began buying power for utility customers in January The state general fund has spent more than billion buying power so far There are predictions that spending will sharply increase this summer as he at drives up the demand for electricity The fact is we cant allow the general fund to be depleted Angelides said There are limits to it It will begin to affect very dramatically th e ability of the state to provide core programs for education health care public safety

an agreement within two weeks Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Whole sale Energy Market continues its investigation Thursday Standard Poors said that if the sale of a state revenue bond is delayed the potential impact on the state general fund could be severe without a rate hike much larger than the increase of more than percent approved by the state Public Utilities Commission last month Rate increases appear difficult in the present political environment and related voter initiatives although none are currently on the ballot remai n a possibility said Standard Poors The state began buying power after the two largest utilities Pacific Gas a nd Electric and Southern California Edison were nearly bankrupt The rates th ey could charge customers were frozen under deregulation as the cost of wholesale power soared producing a debt of billion Standard Poors said the state expected in January to spend less than billion and resolve the problem in a few months with longterm power contracts at lower prices But most of the contracts do not begin until thi s fall or later In addition said Standard Poors it is not unreasonable to expect pa st and future blackouts to affect business location decisions and hence the ultimate direction of the states economy A spokesman for the governor said that Standard Poors view of how the California economy will fare during the electricity crisis is far too dim Californias economy is still fundamentally strong said spokesman Roger Salazar We expect that in we will continue to lead the nation in economic growth and job creation Another Wall Street creditrating firm Moodys has a more positive view o f how the governor and the Legislature have handled the crisis and expects th e state general fund to be repaid by the ratepayer bond We are still at our AA with a negative outlook said Ray Murphy Moodys vice president Nothing that we have learned over the last week or so has led us to change that opinion Angelides said legislation is needed because PGE and Edison are challengin g a PUC action last month that gives the state some revenue from monthly ratepayer bills which is needed to finance the bond to repay the state general fund The utilities say they need more of the ratepayer revenue The treasurer said the legislation would bypass the lengthy PUC process and authorize the state to issue a ratepayer bond of billion or more The governor said again yesterday that he believes a bond of billion will cover state power costs this year Angelides said legislation is urgent because a commitment from three lender s to give the state a billion shortterm loan expires May He said the shortterm bridge loan would ease the strain on the state gener al fund until the main bond can be issued probably in late June The treasurer said that failure to obtain the shortterm loan could lead to more credit downgrades and create perception issues about who we are and where we are in terms of the economy of this state Davis has been criticized on Wall Street for not pushing for an early rate hike to stabilize the utilities and avoid the need for the state to begin buying power The governor said earlier this year that he could have solved the problem i n minutes with a rate hike but refused to do so While addressing the California Chamber of Commerce yesterday Davis said that the longterm contracts will spread the cost of buying power over a decade causing ratepayers to pay less than market rates in the early years and a little above the market rate in later years I do not want to shock this economy into recession Davis said I do not want to burden small business with more than they can sustain Davis wants the state to purchase the transmission systems of the utilities in exchange for giving them part of the ratepayer revenue to finance a bond to pay off their debts That would enable the utilities to resume buying power by the end of next year But negotiations to buy the transmission systems has taken much longer than expected PGE filed for bankruptcy earlier this month and an agreement to buy the Edison transmission system announced a few days later faces opposition in the Legislature Some legislators who think Edison receives too much under the complex agreement have suggested that Edison join PGE in bankruptcy where generators accused of pricegouging may not have all of their bills paid If they go into bankruptcy the state will be buying power for three or fo ur years Davis told the Chamber yesterday That is all we will be doing up here A Stage emergency alert was called yesterday when two power plants unexpectedly stopped operating with temperatures around the state rising Meanwhile Davis announced that Richard Sklar a former ambassador to the wartorn Balkans will lead a task force to speed up the construction of ne w power plants The governor acknowledged while speaking to reporters that he has not met h is earlier goals of avoiding blackouts rate increases and keeping the utiliti es out of bankruptcy This is probably the most complicated challenge the state has faced in years Davis said But we are providing steady and reliable leadership a nd I believe we will have this thing behind us by the end of this fall FERC to weigh limited curbs on electricity prices Caps would apply in Stage shortages By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE April CALIFORNIAS POWER CRISIS WASHINGTON Federal regulators are expected to consider limited wholesale price curbs for Californias chaotic electricity market today but the approach falls far short of the controls sought by many state officials Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staffers have proposed limiting the price that power sellers can charge for wholesale electricity in California only during the most severe shortages known as Stage emergencies The price mitigation would be pegged to the marginal cost of the highestpriced generating unit called upon to run according to a staff report Producers also would be required to sell their excess power to the states grid operator The price controls would last one year and would not apply to other Western states suffering from gyrations in power costs and electricity shortages FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has been an implacable foe of price controls b ut is under considerable political pressure to do more to help California as t he peak powerconsuming summer months approach Commissioner William Massey ha s advocated farreaching price limits while Commissioner Linda Breathitt has wavered on the issue Gov Gray Davis and other California officials have called for broad price controls that also would include other Western states Yesterday Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif formally introduced legislation that would require FERC to impose regional price limits through March Feinstein said the FERC staff proposal was inadequate Once you put the cap just on Stage you force the heavier pricing on stages and she said Other critics have noted that wholesale power prices in California are abnormally high during periods other than Stage emergencies Feinsteins legislation first outlined in March would require FERC to set price caps or impose costbased rates that would limit prices to the cost of producing the power plus a set profit margin New generating plants and power bought through longterm contracts would be exempt However any state covered by the price controls would have to allow utilities to recover their wholesale power costs from consumers The clause helped draw a Republican cosponsor to the bill Sen Gordon Smith of Orego n Smith and other Western lawmakers have complained about the reluctance of California officials to raise retail rates while consumers in neighboring states have seen their power bills soar In recent months the California Public Utilities Commission twice has increased rates for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric the utilities hit hardest by skyrocketing wholesale power prices The FERC staff proposal rejected price caps or costbased rates It would be hard to devise price caps that are low enough to provide price relief but high enough to adequately compensate generators the proposal said The Bush administration and top congressional Republicans are opposed to price controls so it is uncertain how far Feinsteins legislation will get Grid officials declare a Stage alert ASSOCIATED PRESS April SACRAMENTO The states electric grid operator declared a Stage power alert Tuesday after two power plants suddenly went offline Higherthanforecasted temperatures in Southern California also caused dema nd to increase said Lorie ODonley spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator keeper of the state power grid A Stage alert is declared when electricity reserves fall or are expected to fall below percent The two power plants that went offline had been producing about megawatts or roughly enough power for homes We think we may need to request interruptible customers but barring any other big problems we probably wont need to go to a Stage said ODonley Stage alerts are called when the reserves drop below percen t and could result in rolling blackouts like the state has seen on four days since January The ISO said megawatts were unavailable Tuesday morning because of power plants that were down for scheduled or unplanned maintenance Another megawatts from alternative generators such as solar wind and geothermal was also not available ODonley said About half of the alternative generators say they cant afford to keep operating because they are owed about billion by Pacific Gas and Electri c Co and Southern California Edison Top credit agency lowers Californias bond rating ASSOCIATED PRESS April SACRAMENTO A top credit agency lowered its rating on California state bonds Tuesday citing the growing financial drain from the continuing energy emergency The downgrade reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the state of the current electrical power crisis as well as its likely longterm detrimenta l effect on the states economy Standard and Poors said The states ability to repay is debts has been reduced though it is still adequate SP said It dropped the rating on general obligation bonds from doubleA to singleAplus It similarly revised other lease ratings and ratings for th e California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund known as Cal Mortgage SP said it didnt drop the rating farther because the state still has mone y because of Californias diverse economy and because a proposed revenue bon d is slated to reimburse the states treasury for money California is current ly using to buy power for two financially strapped utilities If the state cant quickly sell its revenue bond the impact on the treasur y could be severe unless electricity rates are substantially increased beyond the large increases already scheduled to kick in SP warned SP has had the states general obligation bonds on a creditwatch with negative implications since January when the state began buying power for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric States Bond Rating Downgraded to A Finance Reduction of notches puts it among states with the lowest credit ratings Move could cost California hundreds of millions in borrowing fees By LIZ PULLIAM WESTON and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers A major credit rating agency downgraded billion of California bond s Tuesday in a move that could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the states borrowing costs and saddles California with one of the lowest state credit ratings in the nation Standard Poors Corp cut Californias bond rating by two notches from AA to Aplus citing the mounting and uncertain cost of the current electrical power crisis which has forced the state to spend billions on electricity to keep the lights on SP one of three major rating agencies monitoring Californias financial health said a further downgrade could occur if the state fails t o follow through on plans to issue at least billion in revenue bonds to help pay off energyrelated debts SP is saying We dont have any faith that what you say youre goin g to do youre going to do said Zane Mann publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor a newsletter that tracks government debt Wall Street is concerned by delays surrounding the electricity bond issue but lawmakers hope to pass legislation this week to put the bond iss ue on a fast track and speed up return of the money to the states general fun d Credit ratings help determine how much states and other borrowers have to pay when issuing bonds The lower the rating the higher the interest ra te the state must pay to entice investors to buy The state Treasurers Office concluded in a preliminary estimate that as a result of the downgrade California could have to pay million to million more on the billion in general obligation bonds the state has authorized to pay for ongoing expenses such as school and roadbuilding projects but has yet to issue State revenue bonds should not be affected by the downgrade the officials said However some bond experts disagree Californias energy crisis already has driven down prices of a wide range of the states bonds from general obligation issues that depend on t he states ability to repay to small issues by school districts and cities tha t could be hurt by rising electricity prices Bond traders said SPs downgra de probably would cause prices to fall further All California bond holders are going to lose value in their bonds because the states credit has been downgraded said John Fitzgerald managing partner of SeidlerFitzgerald a Los Angeles municipal debt underwriter The downgrade most affects investors who want to sell their bonds now before the issues mature Investors who hold onto their bonds are still almost certain to get the face value when their securities reach maturity because the state is unlikely to miss any interest payments or otherwise default on its bonds traders said SP analysts said the states continuing surplus and deep and diverse economy helped prevent a further downgrade Still the downgrade places California below most other states on SP s rating scale and on par with Hawaii Among states rated by SP only Louisiana has a lower rating at Aminus according to Bloomberg News In addition the two other major credit rating agencies have indicated they may downgrade Californias bonds Fitch Inc said last week that it wa s contemplating such a move and Moodys Investors Service earlier this month changed its outlook on California bonds to negative from stable Some politicians Tuesday accused SP of overreacting Its just unfair premature and inappropriate for them to do that We do have reserves we do have good revenue projections we do have a plan to get us out of this said Assemblyman Gil Cedillo DLos Angeles In a statement Gov Gray Davis said Californias economy is still fundamentally strong period We expect that in we will continue to le ad the nation in economic growth and job creation State Treasurer Phil Angelides has been pleading with lawmakers to pas s legislation to speed up repayment of billion drained from the states general fund to buy electricity this year That figure is expected to reach billion by years end according to the governor The consequences of a downgrade are profound Angelides said noting that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the recession of the early s It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly establish our legal authority to sell bonds and replenish the states gener al fund Angelides said California began buying massive quantities of electricity in January because the states three major investorowned utilities could no longer afford to do so Since then the state has been purchasing roughly onethir d of the electricity the utilities need to service their customers according to state officials Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis the general fund is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with what is expected to be the largest municipal bond issue in US history Th e bond issue is to be repaid by utility ratepayers through a monthly charge o n their electricity bills However obstacles that threaten timely repayment of the fund are causing consternation among Wall Street analysts about Californias financi al status The bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas Electric Co the states large st investorowned utility has thwarted the states plan to restore the utilities to financial health But it is a dispute over the states formula for repaying the bonds th at has raised the most concern among state officials The state and the utilities are at odds over how much of consumers electricity payments shou ld go to reimburse the state for its power purchases The states two major utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison have challenged the Public Utilities Commissions plan f or splitting up the moneya legal move that threatens to delay issuance of th e bonds The firms contend the allotment granted to the state is too generous and could make it harder for them to recover from the energy crisis Hoping to sidestep the controversy Angelides is urging state lawmaker s to pass an emergency measure this week that sets the bond amount and the amount the state will receive from utility payments The revenue bond was initially expected to be billion but the Davis administration has sinc e proposed a billion issue Times staff writers James Flanigan Jenifer Warren and Julie Tamaki contributed to this report Copyright Los Angeles Times Price Controls Spark Deja Vu Energy The specter of Richard Nixons actions years ago hangs over current debate on how to check the states surging power costs By JAMES F PELTZ Times Staff Writer A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be adopted to stem the states soaring power costs and help consumers who are bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in economicsand in politics for that matter And now the caps are more in dispute than ever because they run counter to the nations move over the la st two decades to deregulate more and more industries from airlines to railroads to energy Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire so controls are again being demanded by lawmakers consumer advocates and othe rs as a way to check surging prices On the other side is a chorus of critics who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and at times making matters worse for consumers Case in point the Golden State itself which tried last summer to use temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state thus widening the imbalance between supply and demand reinforcing the existing shortages and contributing to this winters rolling blackouts But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke t had no way to selfcorrect The utilities couldnt simply refuse to buy electricity in the face of higher prices and with no price ceiling in sigh t something had to be done And now Gov Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary controls until more electricity supplies can be added especially as the state enters the peakpower summer season On Tuesday Sens Dianne Feinste in DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre introduced legislation that would impo se price controls on wholesale energy throughout Western states Mindful of the controversial history of controls Feinstein and Smith stressed that the caps would last only through March But they also argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls I have a strong preference for markets but its a mistake to believe that we have a free market when it comes to energy said Smith the only G OP cosponsor of the legislation Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whi ch regulates US wholesale electricity prices either to impose a regional price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator tying the price of electricity to the cost of producing it Coincidentally FERC today is expected to decide on various other proposals to again limit Californias power costsbut without explicitly stating that the plans include price controls Why Because the Bush administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr among others are on the record as adamantly opposing price caps Thats not surprising Price controls often are tagged as a liberal maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives freemarket ideology Yet ironically hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica n president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide level Richard M Nixon The late president took that rare step years ago this August to try to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound His actions were so dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or in some cases endorse setting limits on prices What he did is almost larger than life now said Shannon Burchett chief executive of RiskLimited Corp a strategic consulting firm in Dallas Nixons controls were the most farreaching since World War II when prices were capped so that profiteers couldnt reap huge sums for scarce commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home In most cases price controls have been much less sweeping and targete d at specific products or services They dont always involve changing the la w either In President Kennedy publicly rebuked the thenUS Steel Cor p and its chairman Roger Blough for starting an industrywide move to raise steel prices The price hikes were rolled back a few days later Since Nixon price controls have become rarer as industries that were once regulatedwhich means their prices were governmentcontrolledhave been deregulated So it is in California where electric utilities prices were controll ed for decades until the states deregulation law in But now that the la w has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices power shortages crippled utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers costs some again wan t price controls on electricity until the crisis eases Which brings everyone back to Nixon Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan Ive heard people make the analogy to what happened when Nixon put on controls but in California this is fundamentally different said Mike Florio a board member of the California Independent System Operator which oversees most of the states electricity grid When you get into a situation of shortage of supplies there is really no restraint at all on prices said Florio who said he normally prefers unfettered markets but also defended the states caps last summer Such government intervention on a temporary basis is better than nothing but I dont think its ideal The reverberations from Nixons fiat arent just felt in California either When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe nt controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state critics promptly pointed to Nixons controls They were a disaster one columnist wrote Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who was in the private sector in the early s turned down several requests to take highlevel White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixons price contro ls Many economists and historians also judge Nixons controls as a mistak e But some maintain that his decisionwhich began with a day freeze on prices wages and rentswasnt entirely a failure and even provided shock value that for a while at least arrested higher inflation In addition part of Nixons move involved taking the dollar off the gold standardwhich in effect meant its price was controlledand letting it float in value against other major currencies And that many believe is t he base upon which todays global financial markets operate Others disagree There really isnt an example of where theyve price controls worked said Robert Goldberg a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis a nonpartisan think

lifted prices typically soar anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the controls were in place Goldberg added Others note that although most of Nixons price controls lasted only a couple of years various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga n In the meantime the controlsaggravated by embargoes and other suppl y cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesdistorted the fr ee market for energy critics say The controls kept US oil prices artificially low which in turn kept demand for oil high giving OPEC more power over world production and prices in the s they contend Nonetheless proponents keep calling for controls when prices for certain items seem to be spiraling out of control Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems President Clintons massive healthreform proposal in the early s included price controls on drugs But the idea set off howls of protest fro m the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and ultimately the entire proposal was shelved Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal controls on rising cable TV rates in and again contending that t he cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their subscribers but specific price caps werent enacted But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi ze that electricity isnt in the same category as an airplane seat steel or other

high But thats generally not an option for people when it comes to electricity Critics of Californias attempt to cap prices last summer said the controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to other states That actually made the tightsupply problem worse in California by driving imports out of the state the Bay Area Economic Forum a research group funded by regional business and government agencies said in a report last week Indeed the temporary caps were basically abandoned by years end to keep enough electricity in the state Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee said there are ways to mitigate the states power prices without having to set rigid controls One proposal

operation of old generators in Glendale and elsewhere produces more than twice the old limits of pollution By JEAN GUCCIONE Times Staff Writer For the past five weeks Glendales Grayson power plant has been belching a halfton of pollutants into the air almost daily more than twic e previous limits The same is true for many of the other power plants in Southern California as the haves generate power sometimes roundtheclock for th e havenots The generators some of them nearly years old and once considered t oo dirty for regular use now keep electricity flowing to fellow residents around the state And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much air pollution as before Californias energy crunch Not every Glendale resident is happy You dont want anyone to get stuck with a rolling

Troncoso director of Glendale Water Power Ther e is a pretty decent tradeoff helping our neighbors in the state to keep their lights on he said A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old There is a potential for more emergency room visits more people seei ng their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer said Dr Henry Gong professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti on With extended hours the Glendale generators are emitting as much as pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand more than double the old limit of pounds a day city and airquality officials said The other power plants in Southern California also have more than doubled their overall emissions according to preliminary figures from the South Coast Air Quality Management District As a group the plants emitted a total of tons of smogforming nitrogen oxide in the first three month s of compared with tons for the same period last year The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energystarved state Under the plan Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers aroundtheclock to meet the states energy demand Usually these boilers hidden behind a tall brick wall sit idle except during the peak summer demand because they are inefficient and costly Glendale like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power continues to produce electricity at its cityowned plant The three cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation a decision that has shielded their residents by and large from the huge utility rate hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere But they also will contribute to easing the states energy emergency in the dirtier air they will be forced to breathe Airquality officials said power plants contribute just about of th e tons of pollution emitted into the air daily with about of the pollution coming from vehicles not factories And in recent years many of the regions municipal power generators have been updated with pollutioncontrol devices that reduce emissions Glendales three steam generators built between and are inefficient by todays standards but they are cleaner since the city pumped millions of dollars into upgrades They will be even cleaner city officials say with more retrofitting Under the plan Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales estimated at million to million this year in equipment to reduce future emissions at the plant and in communitybased programs such as mobi le asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions The city plans to sell as much as megawatts of power enough to ser ve homes Under the decision Tuesday pollution limits resume Jan or when the energy emergency ends In Los Angeles power officials said they dont expect to exceed AQMD caps because they are adding pollution controls at two of the citys four power plants Although they will produce more electricity they should not produce any more nitrogen oxide which in sunlight and heat form ozone

have a problem this summer We have to run these plants said Sheryl Carter a senior policy analyst for the National Resources Defense Council Carter said naturalgaspowered generators like the ones in Glendale are a far superior solution to diesel generators which produce to times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i f energy is unavailable from other sources We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole sh e said Carl Zichella regional staff director for the Sierra Club said the generators should be run as a last resort He also urged consumers to unplu g spare refrigerators and use energyefficient light bulbs to reduce the states overall energy demand The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is efficiency he said

Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors Energy crisis Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington Beach facility to boost output Noise and pollution are concerns By CHRISTINE HANLEY Times Staff Writer On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach families have tried to live with their two very different neighbors They live steps from the Pacific Ocean but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES Corp power plant But Californias power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to double the plants operations by July providing muchneeded electricity bu t taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them Its one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in the wake of the power crisis using a fast track process that allows the projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are completed The plant is so close We want to know if it is impacting our kids in ways we wont know about until years from now said Janette Mortimer w ho lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes closest to the plant Already residents say the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow There are the earringing rumbles and roars There are the mysterious plume s of smoke that waft over the neighborhood Then there is the grime that seem s never to go away If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES the facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory Officials said the plants previous owner Southern California Edison typically ran it at of capacity AES could be allowed to run the four gasfired boilers and a peaker unit whenever California hits a Stage alertwhich is expected to happen often this summer The peaker plant alone is powered by eight jet enginesand sounds like it Currently only two boilers are operating But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and the water they swim in Under the fasttracking process designed to get more electricity for t he state as soon as possible several key environmental questions have yet to be studied Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of Huntington Beachs shoreline in the summer of said that the plant alo ng with other factors played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that is discharged miles offshore back toward the coast AES Inc will pay million to further study the issue but the research wont be complete for some time So much is uncertain said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff These are big big things For now residents say they are bracing for more noise smoke and disruption To begin with AES proposal calls for hours a day of nonstop construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures Residents usually ope n their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes But the noise and smells from the plants may make that impossible Its going to be bad Theres no escape said Bryan Visnoski The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly years The housing tracts came later but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a nd surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor Some have installed doublepaned windows to dampen the sound Others have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views The Mortimers grew tall trees and trained vines past the windows The problems they say began with the energy crisis The plant was owned by Edison until when it was sold to AESCalifornias largest private electricity producerat the dawn of deregulation The two gasfired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant since and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state Gov Gray Dav is signed an executive order allowing peaker plants to operate at extended hours Peaker plants can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle large amounts of natural gas and are noisy Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou d jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport Whenever the peaker plant goes on residents call the Air Quality Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke The inspections have not detected any violations The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from megawatts to megawatts The companys two yearold units represent about of the additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal l this summer Despite the fasttracking process the company has vowed that it would safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant operations If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore AES woul d have to pay the

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL As federal energy regulators consider a plan intended to ease the states worsening energy crisis California officials and some energy experts are already criticizing it as inadequate The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled today to debate a proposal that would force power generators to sell electricity at a discounted price to California during severe power emergencies The proposal would require producers to sell energy to the states power gr id during Stage emergencies Stage emergencies are declared when energy resources are almost depleted allowing utilities to cut off power to customers at any time The plan also would limit how much energy firms could profit off such sales But Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein among others say stronger remedies including the temporary regional price limits they have advocat ed for months are needed to stave off a summer of blackouts and power shortages I think the plan before FERC is too little too late Davis said yesterda y in Sacramento We need help all the time The regulatory commission plan excludes percent of the purchases of power A Stage situation is by definition chaotic as we scramble to find the megawatts to keep the lights on The commission ordered its staff in December to come up with remedies to Californias energy woes The commissioners are expected to make their decision by May a selfimposed deadline to help the Golden State The proposal to be debated today would require producers to sell electricit y to California at a price based on the costs of the leastefficient plant providing the energy More efficient plants sending energy to the state wou ld still be able to make a sizable profit The plan has also drawn criticism because it applies only to California no t other Western states that are also feeling the pinch of higher energy price s But California officials say the proposal does signal a shift in the hard line position of the

Writer Wednesday April San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL Citing the rapidly escalating uncertainty surrounding the power crisis Standard Poors slashed Californias credit rating yesterday for the firs t time since when the state was still climbing out of a recession The downgrade and the energy debacle that led up to it will cost taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the states borrowing costs Investors will probably see the market price of California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further But the biggest blow may be to the states ego SP downgraded the states general obligation bonds two notches to A from AA The only other state currently rated A is Hawaii The only state with a lower credit rating is Louisiana according to SP Most states are rated AA Some states dont have a credit rating because th ey dont have bonds Californias credit rating is still investment grade which means it is n ot expected to default on its bonds However the states ability to repay its debt isnt as strong as it used to be said Steve Zimmermann a managing director with Standard Poors This is a very speculative situation States hire companies like SP to give them an independent credit rating wh en they borrow money by selling bonds The rating reflects the states ability to repay its debt in full on time When they sell new bonds states with lower credit ratings usually pay high er interest than higherrated states to make up for the added risk A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that have already been issued but it can affect the price of bonds when they trade on the open market among investors Yesterdays downgrade reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat e of the current electrical power crisis as well as its likely longterm detrimental effect on the states economy SP said in a news release Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund balances the state typically budgets the capacity to pay debt service whi le still adequate has been reduced In January SP placed the states debt on CreditWatch with negative implications a signal that it might lower the rating In an unusual move SP kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterdays downgrade which means the rating could fall even lower Zimmermann said SP is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit y to sell billion to billion worth of bonds to reimburse the states general fund for past and future power purchases If they did the bond issue theyd replenish the fund at least for the short term If they dont do it then its more of a concern Zimmermann said Unfortunately the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the bonds If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade they would have had a stronger deal said Kelly Mainelli a municipal bond fund manag er with Montgomery Asset Management California must obtain an investmentgrade rating BBB or higher on the bonds before it can sell them Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in anticipation of a ratings cut When prices fall bond yields go up The downgrade is the culmination of everything thats happened since early December he said In November California municipal bonds yields were to percentage points below the national average Today theyre to percentage points above the national average and Mainelli thinks they could go up to percentage points more because of the downgrade The total difference about percentage points doesnt sound like much but it adds up Last year the state itself sold billion in new bonds excluding bonds sold to replace existing bonds If it sells the same amount this year plu s billion in energy bonds that percentage point difference on billion in bonds would cost the state million a year in additional interest costs Yesterdays downgrade only affected the states general obligation bonds an d others secured by the full faith and credit of the state such as the California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund Cal Mortgage But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i n California such as cities counties school and water districts more money when they sell bonds Although their ratings have not changed because of the energy crisis analysts say the yields on most California municipal bonds have gone up and will go up some more as a result of the states downgrade The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade whether they should be or not Psychologically its just how the market reacts says Richard Goldstein a San Ramon financial planner Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before they mature may not get all their principal back But investors who hold their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full Goldstein said No matter how bad the energy crisis gets most experts believe the state wi ll continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds even if it ha s to raise taxes cut expenditures or run a temporary deficit to do so Theres also the prospect at some point of federal help Goldstein said The federal government does not want California to default or even come close Do you know what that would do to the national economy and the world economy Californias bondrating history SP cut its rating on California debt yesterday for the first time since What credit ratings mean AAA Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments AA Very strong capacity to meet financial commitments A Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat more susceptible to adverse circumstances and economic conditions BBB Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments However adverse economic conditions could weaken ability to pay debts Note Ratings below BBB are considered poor investment risks and the issue s sometimes are called

cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTL PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Some key power generators say Californias dearth of energy supplies and its growing demand make it a good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come even if dreaded price caps are imposed Regardless of what the market structure turns out to be the states going to need electricity and its going to need to buy it from somebody said Bill Highlander spokesman for San Josebased Calpine Corp Calpine is investing about billion in power plants over the next four years that will generate megawatts enough for more than million homes The states current energy crisis hasnt really changed our plans or our strategy he said But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa le electricity will hinder not help Californias energy crisis Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay will invest in other states warns Hebert the chairman of the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission And any regulations that cut into future profits wil l scare away desperately needed new power plants he says Eight of the new power plants approved in California already are under construction Twelve more are under review according to the California Energy Commission which approves power plants CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said thats a huge boost over the last decade when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation not a threat of price ca ps kept applications down No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant s since December The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s o low you couldnt make a profit Schlichting said Its still a market that people seem to want to come in and produce power for Other companies still planning to invest in California include North Carolinabased Duke Energy which has two plants in the works and Houstonbased Reliant Energy which is negotiating with the state to sell power on longterm contracts Reliants spokesman Richard Wheatley wouldnt say whether price caps alon e would inhibit them from building more plants What he did say is that Californias power politics leave a lot of room for improvement The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an d implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away Meanwhile Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations If California wants to encourage construction its got to tone down its vilification and stop adding more restrictions Wheatley said Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant we have to look at the economics of the facility we have to look at the regulatory situation esoteric things like what the mindset is like he said California is not the easiest place in which to do business Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines gas reserves and plants already under construction that its folly to turn back now We want to build in California but we need to have regulatory stability or at least regulatory clarity to move these things forward because theyre halfbillion dollar projects in some cases said Tom Williams a spokesma n for Duke Thats a lot of bananas Senators Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre plan this we ek to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t he Western states They hope to keep prices down in the shortterm and give California and other troubled states a breather to make longterm decisions Feinsteins bill does not yet specify a price Some economists say to per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable yet provide generators a profit Prices have gone as high as for the same amount of power in the past year Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for generators to swallow said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Berkeleys energy institute Such a cap would account for variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera te much of the energy in Californias power plants Price caps can be effective but only if they are very carefully designed warned Frank Wolak chairman of the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee The ISO manages the states power grid Set them too high and companies will only bid that amount saving little money Wolak said Too low and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe re unless all other nearby states have the same price limits Also capping the most expensive energy sales power sold on the spot market at times of high demand wont lower prices for other key componen ts of the states energy supply such as electricity bought for the next days power needs Suppose youre paying every single megawatt hour That still puts us in big trouble with wholesale energy costs Wolak said The state already has spent billion buying power for customers of Californias three largest investorowned utilities which lost their credi t and thus their ability to buy power after paying sharply higher costs for wholesale energy Borenstein said paying even a megawatt hour is still preferable to the unknown particularly since economists have warned that there is virtually no upper limit to what energy companies can charge This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th e price is going to be at the price cap and if we dont have a price cap th ey will be way above the price cap Borenstein said FERC remains opposed to price caps but after months of complaints the boa rd this week is considering a limited cap on the most expensive lastminute power buys The proposal would cap California but not the rest of the West and order wholesalers to sell to the state during the most extreme power shortages Though it provides some cushioning it does not address the high prices California swallows the rest of the time Thats the point of Feinsteins bill The crisis point is this summer to next summer and we need some federal assistance said Howard Gantman spokesman for Feinstein This would assure the generators a reasonable profit and continue to spur on further investment into new plants On the Net California Energy Commission wwwenergycagov

debts The agency put the states general obligation bonds on a creditwatch wit h negative implications Jan shortly after California began buying powe r for its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas a nd Electric Co On the Net Standard Poors wwwstandardandpoorcom Associated Press State bond rating lowered Posted at pm PDT Tuesday April BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News One of Wall Streets top creditrating houses has downgraded Californias bonds because of the states handling of the energy crisis a move that cou ld ultimately cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars Saying that mounting and uncertain power costs are likely to do lasting har m to Californias economy New Yorkbased Standard Poors on Tuesday lowere d the states credit rating on its general obligation bonds two notches from AA to A with a negative outlook That puts California near the bottom of the state bond heap with only one state Louisiana rated lower Standard Poors said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv e the power crisis The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener al obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction The interest on those bonds which will rise from an estimated to perhaps percent is paid from the states taxfinanced general fund Although the rating change doesnt apply technically to the different type of bond t he state plans to issue by June for power purchases it will probably make tho se bonds more expensive for the state too bond experts say Heightened urgency Theres a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating particularly since the PGE bankruptcy said David Hitchcock California analyst for Standard Poors This problem could move quickly At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising To me its clear that SP doesnt have much faith in this powerbailout plan of the Legislature and the governor To me thats the reason they did it said Zane Mann publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor newsletter No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade Hitchcock said The major factor he said was simply spiraling costs and no longterm plan for paying the bills Last week Gov Gray Davis said the state had been spending million a day to buy electricity up from million a day in late March Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are higher All three major Wall Street creditrating agencies have California on socalled credit watch but only Standard Poors has downgraded One municipal bond expert said Standard Poors had been trigger happy and eager to downgrade Raymond Murphy Moodys California analyst said he had no immediate plans to change Californias bond rating but that hes anxiou s to see officials produce a longterm plan for financing power purchases Murphy said he had a conference call with state officials about the issue Tuesday morning We want the state to develop the plan that gets the general fund out of power purchasing Murphy said The state says its working on that but theres a roadblock Revenue bonds A major piece of the states plan is to have the Department of Water Resources issue billion to billion in revenue bonds to pay back the general fund for what has been taken to buy power in recent months But tha t portion of the plan is tied up in a dispute between PGE and the California Public Utilities Commission over how to spend the extra money generated by electricity rate increases The dispute has also held up the billion in financing the state had arranged to pay down the advances it took out of th e general fund to buy power To break the logjam officials from the state treasurers office have asked lawmakers to pass emergency legislation to allow the state to issue the revenue bonds Californias credit rating and financial strength will be in jeopardy unt il the states general fund is repaid for energy costs state Treasurer Phil ip Angelides said in a statement Tuesday State Finance Director Tim Gage and Gov Davis both downplayed the significance of the rate change Through a press officer Davis said the states economy remains fundamentally strong The state was downgraded to a lower A rating in and went on to see tremendous economic growth Mounting pressure Still a downgrade is bad news that sends a psychological signal in both th e finance and real worlds Some industry watchers said they hope the downgrad e pushes lawmakers and state officials whom they perceive to be too slow in responding to the crisis It sounds like the bond market might be out ahead of some of the policymakers in California said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute Were facing a real emergency here John Hallacy managing director of municipal research at Merrill Lynch sai d a lower credit rating puts more pressure on the state to issue the revenue bonds fast and to conserve cash Were kind of at the critical juncture now where the pieces are still all over the floor Hallacy said of the states efforts to build and approve a longterm solution to the power crisis To Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network and a leading critic of the states efforts to bail out PGE and Southern California Edison the downgrade means the analysts are watching She said she hopes that President Bush and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are watching too Hopefully this is a wakeup call for FERC Those guys could solve this i n a nanosecond Hoge said This is just another milepost on the downward spiral to economic catastrophe Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at or QA with Gov Gray Davis on energy issues Gov Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday On the subject of electricity Davis talked about increasing the number of power plants the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the condition of the states two largest utilities Souther n California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Davis has proposed a deal to rescue Edison and the Legislature is considering it PGE has filed for bankruptcy Here is a condensed version of Davis remarks Q What would you like to say by way of introduction about the states electricity problems Davis There are really two problems One is the amount of power available and the other is the price of power In well have more megawatts on line at least more By well have a slight excess of power over demand Thats very important Because at the moment we import percent of our power We have no leverage We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy That will never change until we have more power than we need OK price As you know the only entity that can influence the wholesale price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that In this state for all power including municipal power spent roughly billion In we spent billion I dont know what it will be this year but it will be substantially higher Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do a thing zero zippo Lest you think Im being partisan that commission consists entirely of Clinton appointees The final piece is the financial consequences of whats happened to date I t is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison creditworthy an d able to reenter the power purchasing market Jan we can then go t o the PGE creditors committee the generators to whom PGE owes money and s ay to them Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison We believe that this is a far better deal than PGE can give you I think this is a fair plan We get every electron that Edisons utility ow ns committed for years at a costofservice basis Under current law the y could sell that next March at market rates We got million returned fr om the holding company a billion investment in the transmission and delive ry systems a permanent easement on about acres of environmental property around all their hydro facilities Q Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin g in the electric system What will it look like in a couple of years Davis It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power entirely commencing Jan Our goal is to get them back in business In addition to investorowned utilities I believe we also need a public power authority At some point I believe the private sector will say to itself I want to build new plants to replace the yearold plants but do I really want to get the state to a percent margin over supply there by reducing the value of the electrons I already own If they do God bless them But if they dont at least well have the opportunity to build them ourselves Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand the spot market prices will come down dramatically Q You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem in minutes if youd been willing to raise rates Now rates are going to be raised Should you have favored a rate increase earlier Davis I should have been more specific I should have said I could have solved it in minutes if I wanted to triple rates I think the rate increase I proposed is fair It rewards people who are the most energy efficient the people who only use up to percent of their baseline The y are approximately half the state So half the state will see no rate increase beyond the percent that everyone saw in January Q Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on o r at some point would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a blackout Davis We have to provide power There are many people who have medical devices that have to keep running Blackouts can cause deaths traffic accidents all kinds of calamities that I wouldnt want to happen Im reluctant to tell the generators well pay any price so Im not going to say well pay absolutely any price but my bias obviously is to find a way to keep the lights on Q When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought from wha t companies at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i n coming years Davis Well reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to market The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of purchasing electricity That information has to be made public That will probably be in less than two months Believe me I dont like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio n Im doing it for one reason only which is that I know every additional edg e I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers Q Theres an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe r crisis Is that right Davis The simple answer to that is no because the state will be fully reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold At the moment in the short term it is crowding out other spending But I think everyone understands thats a temporary phenomenon until the state i s reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th at I proposed Q Would it be your pledge that ratepayers not taxpayers will fully repay the states cost in purchasing electricity Davis That is the assumption underlying these bonds Thats right as it relates to electricity but obviously the conservation incentives came out of the general fund Q Have you talked to President Bush about this Davis I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesnt wa nt to be helpful but this state and particularly this region has been disproportionately helpful in Americas economic growth and technological productivity If he wants America to grow it behooves him to keep Californ ia growing To date I think its fair to say that of my public requests President Bush has been responsive to all but the price caps Davis Power surplus by Published Wednesday April in the San Jose Mercury News BY DON THOMPSON Associated Press SACRAMENTO Even as power grid operators warned the states lights could flicker again by weeks end Gov Gray Davis on Tuesday pledged that Californians will be wallowing in electricity by the end of Davis compared the emergency to fighting a large forest fire in a few years the fire will be out and the state will be out of the energybuying business Just in case Davis plans fail however an Assembly task force is considering options including having the state buy Southern California Edison Critics have hammered Davis for his handling of the power crisis and his predictions have faltered before In January Davis set three goals as energy prices spiraled upward and shor t supply endangered the states large investorowned utilities to avoid blackouts bankruptcies and rate increases All three have since happened On Tuesday Davis lowered the bar substantially If the lights stay on w e will have succeeded Our goal is to keep the power flowing in this state t o avoid blackouts to moderate the price increases in a fair and reasonable w ay and reward those who conserve the most and to chart a steady course Even keeping the lights on may be difficult as temperatures climb this week warned the Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid The ISO declared a Stage emergency Tuesday afternoon when the state came within percent of running out of electricity after two power plants went offline unexpectedly Springs first warm spell is likely to boost demand by megawatts t he equivalent of two large power plants able to power million homes the ISO said in calling for more energy conservation The increase comes as hydroelectric power runs low across the dry Northwest and as megawatts of power remain unavailable due to planned or unplanned plant shutdowns Davis insisted that statewide conservation this summer can stave off widespread blackouts as the state rushes to build its way out of the supply shortage At the end of we will have more power than we need we will have regained control of our energy destiny Davis promised in a speech to the California Chamber of Commerce By the end of you can have all the appliances on You can you know dont turn anything off you can just luxuriate in all your electricity Davis promised a percent supply surplus by To that end he named former diplomat Richard Sklar to head a new generation implementation task force of business consultants charged wi th speeding up power plant siting and construction Before entering public service Sklar was president of San Franciscobased construction machinery manufacturer OBrien Kreitzberg Standard and Poors dropped Californias credit rating Tuesday warning that continued purchases could hurt the state treasury Great America to avoid blackouts Published Wednesday April in the San Jose Mercury News Associated Press Paramounts Great America amusement park in Santa Clara has struck a deal with the municipal utility to keep the power on even during rolling blackou ts this summer The park will cut electricity usage by percent on highdemand days which could be nearly every day this summer by turning off fountains decorative lighting and air conditioning in some buildings Santa Claras cityowned utility Silicon Valley Power will use the power savings to help avert blackouts said Larry Owens customer service manager for the utility Even if the situation gets dire and blackouts are required the park will be exempt because of the arrangement Owens said About companies with facilities in Santa Clara including Intel Corp S un Microsystems Inc and Agilent Technologies Inc have agreed to the same arrangement as has Santa Clara University States bond rating is lowered The energy crisis brings an A designation which likely will mean higher borrowing costs April By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Californias electricity crisis prompted a top credit agency to downgrade the states credit rating by two notches to its lowest level in seven years The move is likely to force the state to pay millions of dolla rs more in interest when it borrows Its a statement from Wall Street to California to get your act together said Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster a GOP energy finance expert i n the Assembly The ratings action is serious and should be a warning to the state that it is on the wrong course added Mark McCray a municipalbonds manager at Newport Beachbased Pimco This downgrade will cost the state a lot in ter ms of increased financing and costs until if ever it is upgraded Standard and Poors Corp concerned about the billion drained from the states coffers to buy power this year cut Californias credit rating from AA to A The reduction applies to voterapproved bonds called general obligation or GO bonds that typically provide funds for schools parks water projects and highways About billion worth of GO bonds have been approved by voters About billion have not yet been sold The creditrating cut would force the state to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers to the unsold bonds If the state were to sell all billi on under the lower credit rating it could be forced to pay an additional million to million annually in interest depending on market condition s Shortly after Standard and Poors announcement state Treasurer Phil Angelides urged lawmakers to limit the size of the states looming electricitybond sale to billion or billion less than Gov Gray Davis wants Angelides said capping the revenue bond at billion would head off legal challenges from utilities expedite the passage of the bond plan through th e Legislature and allow the sale to go forward At a minimum we need an authorization of billion Angelides said If Davis and lawmakers want more they should do it later Angelides added Davis has sought billion The rift between the governor and the treasurer both Democrats marks their sharpest political divergence since the energy crisis erupted last year A Davis spokesman declined to comment on the difference We are working wi th the treasurer and others to draft legislation for that bond bill and well continue to work with him said Roger Salazar The Davis administration hopes to raise the money by selling revenue bonds backed by a charge on consumers utility bills The sale had been planned f or May but has since been pushed back to June or July at the earliest But there is a clock ticking The state has been spending million to million a day for electricity The longer the delay in selling the bonds t he less money will be available to buy cheaper energy for the state under longterm contracts Before funding future power purchases the bond proceeds must go to pay bac k the billion the state has spent on electricity purchased since January o n behalf of Californias three big cashstrapped utilities While the Standard and Poors downgrade wont directly affect the electrici ty bonds since they wont be GO bonds it does reflect Wall Streets concer n about the unstanched outflow of state funds In my mind theres no doubt that SP is doing this because they simply don t have faith in the proposed bailout and what the state is going to have to g o through to solve its power problems said Zane Mann the editor of a newsletter that tracks Californias generalobligation bonds Mann said the A rating puts California below average nationally The rating downgrade sliced the value of an existing year California GO bo nd by percent he said But since most investors who buy California bonds hold them to maturity Mann said the losses would be largely confined to paper Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek who authored the bill that authorized the power bonds said the sale should be limited to the billion originally provided for in the bill The bill provides for the utilities to forward money collected from ratepayers to the state Departmen t of Water Resources which purchases the power As the state spent more than anticipated on emergency electricity purchases Davis sought to increase the size of the bond sale But that suggestion has led the utilities to challenge the bills rate diversion mechanism which has put a cloud on our ability to acquire financing Keeley said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said he would strongly support any move to cap the amount of borrowing the state would do to buy electricity His staff said Republicans are skeptical that the ratepayers revenues are sufficient to cover the costs in the Davis administrations electricity rescue plan Nobody believes that the revenue stream is wide enough to cover all the governors energy solutions Its still being sucked up by the states utilities said Cox spokesman Jaime Fis Fis Register staff writers James B Kelleher and Diana McCabe and the Associate d Press contributed to this report Fire stokes wholesale gas cost The question is whether the retail price will climb too April By ANNE C MULKERN The Orange County Register The Tosco refinery fire may fuel rising prices on the gasoline retail marke t The spotmarket price rose cents within hours of the fire Photo Leonard Ortiz The Register Wholesale gasoline prices jumped Tuesday a day after fire erupted at Tosco Corps Carson refinery But energy experts said it is too soon to know whether the fire will drive retail gas prices higher Gas prices already are climbing because of increased demand heading into summer higher costs for additives that make cleanerburning fuel and a shi ft in marketing strategy by Tosco which wants to sell less gas at a higher price The refinery fire has the ability to worsen an already bleak situation energy experts said It doesnt take much in this market said Suzanne Garfield California Energy Commission spokeswoman Its very volatile Tosco said it will shift any lost gasoline production to its Wilmington refinery It was unclear however how long the Carson refinery would be do wn for repairs Tosco spokesman Clark Wrigley couldnt say whether the Wilmington plant could make enough gasoline to meet the companys needs in Southern California Within hours of the fire gas prices had jumped cents per gallon on the spot market a daily market where refiners sell surplus supplies That was driven mainly by speculation as those with gas to sell waited to see how high the price would go Prices later fell back to an increase of about cents from a day before Just the fact that there is a hiccup in the refinery makes everyone cringe and say Im not going to sell said Bob van der Valk manager at Cosby Oil a Santa Fe Springs gasoline wholesaler A day or so of higher spot prices probably wont affect retail costs But i f wholesale prices stay up for several days retailers will pass on those cos ts to consumers Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of California Power Virus Andersen Analysis WASHINGTONBUSINESS WIREApril via NewsEdge Corporation A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practice head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of the Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to California increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerterm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading and marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests In addition limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a critical valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemergence of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The survey conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems amp Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarget for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompted retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RTO deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimproving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the companys future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal David O Jermain Simplify market design Build a continuing role for regulators Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions Couple realtime retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition Provide special incentives for RTO investment formation and development Break down regulatory and political barriers to market

Consumer advocate revels in uphill battle Monday April San Francisco Chronicle Given a choice Nettie Hoge would rather be out in her garden right about now digging in the dirt Instead the head of The Utility Reform Network is digging into Californias energy mess making sure the average Joe doesnt take it in the kisser as lawmakers regulators and utility brass hats try to keep the lights on and utilities afloat Its grueling work full of long hours that leave precious little time for the gardening Hoge so adores Not that shes complaining Hoge honestly loves her job and insists she wouldnt do anything else Ive got a mutant gene she said with a laugh as she relaxed for just a moment in a spartan office littered with messy piles of paperwork Ive always wanted to do this TURN has been keeping tabs on companies like Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Pacific Bell for more than years Hoge and her crew lobby the Public Utilities Commission counsel lawmakers analyze reports and file the occasional lawsuit They are in short professional gadflies who represent the public in a system that some say favors big business The biggest protector of the consumer by far has been TURN said Bob Gnaizda public policy director for the Greenlining Institute in San Francisco Hoge has made TURN into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation Its not glamorous work nor is it particularly lucrative Hoge a lawyer by training took a pay cut when she accepted the ayear job in And truth be told most folks have no idea Hoge is in their corner There are other rewards she said You dont get the adoration of Joe Citizen standing up and yelling Yay TURN But theres an excitement about being involved in the discussions where the big decisions are made The youngest of four children Hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up following her career Army officer father from Kansas to Oklahoma to Texas All the places where you can shoot big guns she joked Hoge graduated from high school in Pullman Wash After a stint at the University of Southern California she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University and earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco Hoges entire career has been spent protecting the underdog During a two year stint as a law school graduate at Brobeck Phleger Harrison in San Francisco I got into trouble for doing too much pro bono work Hoge recalled The partners would come around each month to check our billable hours Mine were always zero Since taking the helm almost six years ago Hoge has led TURN to some impressive consumer victories They include persuading the Public Utilities Commission to create a million fund to underwrite rural telephone service and bringing an end to ratepayer subsidies of PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in Hoge a stickler for detail has a reputation for giving exhaustive answers to even mundane questions Everybody agrees she knows what shes talking about said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights In many respects TURN is the intellectual force in this debate Those of us who are deeply involved in this issue rely upon Nettie to lay out the facts for us Hoge is surprised people think her wonkish but admits she is circumspect My big fear is being marginalized and having people think we at TURN dont know what were talking about she said Maybe I overcompensate Few doubt Hoges smarts but she has plenty of critics among the utilities lawmakers and lobbyists she has crossed swords with over the years However none of them will say anything publicly We have no comment on her said Shawn Cooper a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Corp the parent company of the foundering utility It was the same story with Southern California Edison and many of the legislators who have criticized Hoge and TURN in recent years Hoge isnt surprised her adversaries are keeping mum Theres nothing for them to gain by saying anything negative about us because the public is on our side she said Still TURN has drawn criticism from Carl Wood generally considered the most ardent consumer advocate on the PUC Frankly I would have expected myself to be on the same page with TURN more than I actually am Wood said Im not sure they wholeheartedly believe in regulation and I think it comes from a distrust of regulators But maybe Im taking it personally Wood chastised TURN for supporting utility divestiture of generating plants as Californias deregulation effort got under way And he said Hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators The utilities have some culpability but they are not the main driver behind the crisis Wood said TURNs interventions do not reflect that reality Still he gave TURN high marks and credited Hoge with making it a far more effective advocate Hoge admits she has had her hands full with the energy crisis saying she and her staff are trying to keep our health and sanity Asked if she would have joined TURN if she had known how crazy Californias energy market would become and how hard she would have to work Hoge was characteristically wary I dont think anyone would want to sign up for this she said after a moments pause On the one hand its very serious very rewarding work But on the other hand sometimes youre just beating your head against the wall Still Hoge doesnt plan to give up the fight anytime soon But at some point Id like to retreat and spend some time contemplating the forest for the trees Or the garden for the plants Nettie Hoge Age Residence Oakland Job Executive director The Utility Reform Network October to present The utility and telecommunications industry watchdog group in San Francisco represents consumers before the Public Utilities Commission the Legislature and elsewhere Education Bachelors degree in communications Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University Law degree cum laude from University of San Francisco Background Most of Hoges year career has been spent protecting the little guy first as a social worker and later as an attorney with Consumers Union and the California Department of Insurance under Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi

inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis By Pete Wilson Published June The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand Five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer including thenLt Gov Gray Davis California enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some percent Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and keep in California all the jobs that it would produce And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in and the defeat that year by California voters of Prop which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation The total megawattage of the filings for doubled that for After the effective date March of the deregulation legislation AB and the defeat of Proposition November removing the threat of repeal the total for was double that of exceeding the MW mark in alone Just look at the filings for and in the California Energy Commission graph above Far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the Davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by mid applications to build new power plants that promised to add megawatts to Californias power supply Thats why I signed it I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB just as I and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation No one could have anticipated in the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the West warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by The reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis Now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis Governor Davis has been quoted as saying If I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes Sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable As a result California bonds have suffered two downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs He has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him then I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction Pete Wilson is the former governor of California You can see this story at voicesnewsvoiceshtml

Puts PGE in A Cash Bind Utility is borrowing million per hour Electricity Crisis Puts PGE in A Cash Bind Utility is borrowing million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco Chronicle

skyrockets under rule easing wholesale controls By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Dec Some wholesale electricity prices on Californias Power Exchange nearly tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled while officials declared another electric emergency In the first full business day under new sharply disputed trading rules aimed at averting blackouts prices of electricity on the Power Exchange where the bulk of Californias electricity is bought and sold surged far above Fridays per megawatt hour The days first PX auction produced average prices of per megawatt hour and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of One year ago the average PX price was about Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said Prices were crazy yesterday and theyre crazier today Arredondo said This will be the most expensive month ever in California Im sure of it The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and strong electric demand throughout the West for Mondays price runup but critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have backfired At the ISOs request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday gave permission to lift a price cap and replace it with a requirement that power sellers who set prices higher than must explain them later The ISO said the changes would improve the grids stability by attracting more power to California repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs and reducing lastminute deals The rules were immediately attacked by Gov Gray Davis and state regulators who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other problems Thats just what happened Monday said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Price gouging has reached a new level he said Its not surprising Its exactly what the governor predicted In addition a glitch in the way the ISO and the PX use twostage electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will temporarily spur more lastminute trading instead of less according to power plant owners and the ISO ISO officials who have long warned that lastminute deals can hurt the stability of the electric grid said the effect will be minimal but Power Exchange officials predict it could be massive The test will come today In an effort to solve the problem the PX late Monday asked FERC to make another emergency change in trading rules lifting caps on the second round of power auctions which are used to set congestion pricing The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers almost universally the utilities which then turn around and supply Californians power The ISO was created to control the transmission grid but it has emerged as the buyer of about onefourth of Californias power when stability problems arise and it then resells that power to utilities Meanwhile the ISO declared another stage two electric emergency Monday afternoon the th since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

woes David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by Californias efforts to deregulate the states electricity market We think you made a terrible mess of it he said And now he pointed out Californias troubles have become a headache for other states as well with no end to the problem in sight

Puts PGE in A Cash Bind Utility is borrowing million per hour Electricity Crisis Puts PGE in A Cash Bind Utility is borrowing million per hour David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writers TuesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis Pacific Gas and Electric Co warned that it soon could run out of money to buy electricity for its million customers The credit situation is getting much tighter said Greg Pruett a spokesman for the San Francisco utility There will come a time when we wont be able to buy power for people This is going to happen more sooner than later The danger for PGE is that financial institutions will stop lending the utility money to cover its expenses Northern Californias power undoubtedly would continue to flow but it is unclear who would pay for it or how Meanwhile the states energy shortage eased slightly as PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which had been closed for repairs returned to operation ahead of schedule The which oversees the power grid declared a Stage emergency alert late yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below percent of total capacity Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis State officials had warned last week that a Stage alert might be called if as much as a third of Californias generating capacity remained down for repairs A Stage emergency allows utilities to initiate rolling blackouts to relieve pressure on the system Milderthanexpected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon prevented the situation from getting out of control officials said But for PGE there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes as a financial disaster in the making UTILITY BILLION IN DEBT As of the end of November Pruett said PGE had racked up about billion in charges buying power on the wholesale market charges that the utility was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze Every hour that goes by means were in debt a million dollars more Pruett said Although this may be the case PGEs gloomanddoom stance can be seen as an attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs Last week the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PGE had not met requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs incurred in the volatile wholesale power market PGES STOCK PRICE FALLS This is playing havoc with PGEs finances The companys stock fell percent to yesterday after several leading brokerages issued pessimistic outlooks for PGEs profitability The utility predicts that it could be as much as billion in the hole by the end of the month This situation cannot go on indefinitely Pruett said The price of retail electricity needs to rise Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PGEs plight but insisted that the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California proceeds with deregulation of the states power market Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco But going forward she added we need to get wholesale prices under control Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone Hoge said she hopes PGEs implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get the attention of federal regulators She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on Californias wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in higher bills for some over the summer Wholesale electricity prices are now times higher on average than in the spring Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was unable to keep pace with demand They have remained high ever since Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a permegawatt rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity elsewhere But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere between and and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did not foresee prices reaching that level We didnt think it would go that high said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for the agency In addition while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids on the market most of them were in the south Because the distribution system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north where demand is highest the bids were of limited benefit Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without meaningfully augmenting supply Dorinson declined to comment DAVIS PREDICTION COMES TRUE Gov Gray Davis protested the ISOs decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday night saying an end to the rate limit would do more harm than good I suspect that sadly his prediction has come true said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor Last night the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISOs decision Ending the rate limit exchange officials said threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets About a quarter of Californias generating capacity was offline as plants throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week Loretta Lynch the president of the PUC said the inspections were merely a form of information gathering but she stressed that it was unacceptable for so many plants to be down at the same time She called for a system to be developed to better schedule maintenance Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling Californias energy market this week Email David Lazarus at and Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco Chronicle

skyrockets under rule easing wholesale controls By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Dec Some wholesale electricity prices on Californias Power Exchange nearly tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled while officials declared another electric emergency In the first full business day under new sharply disputed trading rules aimed at averting blackouts prices of electricity on the Power Exchange where the bulk of Californias electricity is bought and sold surged far above Fridays per megawatt hour The days first PX auction produced average prices of per megawatt hour and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of One year ago the average PX price was about Power Exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said Prices were crazy yesterday and theyre crazier today Arredondo said This will be the most expensive month ever in California Im sure of it The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and strong electric demand throughout the West for Mondays price runup but critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have backfired At the ISOs request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday gave permission to lift a price cap and replace it with a requirement that power sellers who set prices higher than must explain them later The ISO said the changes would improve the grids stability by attracting more power to California repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs and reducing lastminute deals The rules were immediately attacked by Gov Gray Davis and state regulators who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other problems Thats just what happened Monday said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Price gouging has reached a new level he said Its not surprising Its exactly what the governor predicted In addition a glitch in the way the ISO and the PX use twostage electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will temporarily spur more lastminute trading instead of less according to power plant owners and the ISO ISO officials who have long warned that lastminute deals can hurt the stability of the electric grid said the effect will be minimal but Power Exchange officials predict it could be massive The test will come today In an effort to solve the problem the PX late Monday asked FERC to make another emergency change in trading rules lifting caps on the second round of power auctions which are used to set congestion pricing The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers almost universally the utilities which then turn around and supply Californians power The ISO was created to control the transmission grid but it has emerged as the buyer of about onefourth of Californias power when stability problems arise and it then resells that power to utilities Meanwhile the ISO declared another stage two electric emergency Monday afternoon the th since Nov and pleaded for continued conservation Some big power users were told to reduce consumption although the ISO said generally the outlook has improved slightly About megawatts of power were off line Monday compared with a high of more than last week A megawatt can supply about to households depending on season and location The ISO blames the almost unheard of coldweather emergencies on an unusual number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that compete with California for electricity Its a very tough problem right now ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said I almost could look back and say summer was fun The governor PUC president Loretta Lynch consumer advocates and others blame the deregulated electric market for the coldweather power crunches As that controversy raged on state officials who are monitoring the increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last weeks runaway prices On Friday alone according to the California Electricity Oversight Board it cost million to deliver power through the ISOcontrolled grid which serves about threefourths of the states electric consumers That would be enough to fully pay for a new cleanerburning megawatt power plant about every two days Mondays bill wont be fully computed for another few days but it appears that it will be significantly higher according to the oversight board We have a huge transfer of wealth going on and were not getting anything for it Pacific Gas and Electric Corp spokesman Gregg Pruett said Meanwhile financial analysts Monday warned investors that the states two largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its longterm and shortterm debt ratings for PGE and Southern California Edison as well as the latters parent company Edison International Fitch cited increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to borrow money in the future Also on Monday Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co and Banc of America Securities lowered their ratings on PGE Corps stock which fell Monday to a share down nearly percent The firm also lowered its rating for Edison International whose stock closed at a share down nearly percent Moodys Investors Service put the securities of PGE and its parent PGE Corp on watch for a downgrade PGE estimates that at the end of November it had paid out billion more for power than it has been able to collect although consumer advocates disagree pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility revenues in other special accounts Before the December runup in wholesale prices PGE had requested a percent rate increase which state regulators put on hold Now the rate increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily Pruett said but he declined to say how much PGE might seek Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase some are beginning to talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be brought back down Its not sustainable said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network and a member of the ISO board It has to stop Bee staff writer

woes David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer WednesdayDecember San Francisco Chronicle California officials have blamed the states energy woes in part on the Pacific Northwests not having enough extra power to share But in Oregon and Washington theyre blaming California for not coming through on a decadesold bargain to supply muchneeded electricity in the winter in return for the Northwests juice in the summer If the current power shortages worsen consumers throughout the West Coast face an increasing likelihood of blackouts Until now California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually beneficial powersharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made up for by surpluses in the other Weve had a traditional reliance on California in the winter said Dulcy Mahar a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore which sells power produced by federal dams in the region Without Californias electricity weve had to take some extraordinary steps Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that in a normal year would be used to generate power next summer As a result the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable to help meet Californias surging energy demand in the months ahead when millions of air conditioners are added to the states already strained electricity system Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer predicted Kellan Fluckiger chief operating officer of the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon he said The ISO called a Stage power emergency at pm yesterday as reserves fell once again to dangerously low levels Power was cut to some voluntary users Meanwhile federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the California Power Exchange which coordinates the states wholesale power market to restore price caps for electricity rates A permegawatt limit was lifted by state officials last week On Monday wholesale power prices spiked as high as and are expected to top today Last year at this time electricity could be bought by utilities such as San Franciscos Pacific Gas Electric Co for a mere per megawatt Against this backdrop California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls apart We never saw such a tight demandsupply situation said John Harrison a spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council a fourstate body charged with balancing energy production with environmental concerns The timing of this really caught us by surprise California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two regions are completely dissimilar In California demand for electricity soars in the summer when all those air conditioners add to the states already considerable energy load In Oregon and Washington demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of all homes are heated with electricity a reflection of the regions historically dirtcheap power prices More than half of all power in Oregon Washington Idaho and western Montana comes from dams along the Columbia Snake and other rivers These include federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells electricity to customers basically at cost For decades the arrangement worked fine California helped heat the Northwest in the winter and the Northwest helped cool California in the summer This year however everything changed As California stumbled from one crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted since June The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual pollution limits Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this time of year it is now frantically hunting for outofstate generators that can come through in a pinch And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the border power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about degrees below normal An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse According to official projections the Northwest will come up short next month in meeting its power needs by more than megawatts roughly the amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually dry winter so far This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and indicates a smallerthannormal snowpack in the mountains which would affect rivers in the spring Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter Unless the rain and snow arrive in full fury next month Mahar said this almost certainly will reduce the Northwests ability to help meet Californias energy needs in the summer Our reservoirs are like savings accounts she said When we cash them out we dont have enough left in the bank Steve Johnson executive director of the Washington Public Utility District Association a Seattle trade group representing regional utilities said the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise for weeks to come Were trying to buy energy every place we can find it he said Like many observers north of the border Johnson is dismayed by Californias efforts to deregulate the states electricity market We think you made a terrible mess of it he said And now he pointed out Californias troubles have become a headache for other states as

<30103619.1075843593455.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joseph.alamo@enron.com,2001-06-04 06:14:00,Former Gov Wilson Criticizes Gov Davis Editorial from Sacramento Bee Sunday June Cc to blame but Davis is His inaction allowed a problem to become a power and fiscal crisis By Pete Wilson Published June The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand Five years ago when deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer including thenLt Gov Gray Davis California enjoyed an excess of supply over demand amounting to some percent Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition first to drive down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and second to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and keep in California all the jobs that it would produce And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in applications to build power plants especially after the effective date of the legislation in and the defeat that year by California voters of Prop which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation The total megawattage of the filings for doubled that for After the effective date March of the deregulation legislation AB and the defeat of Proposition November removing the threat of repeal the total for was double that of exceeding the MW mark in alone Just look at the filings for and in the California Energy Commission graph above Far from causing the problem of energy shortage as the Davis administration charges deregulation caused providers to file by mid applications to build new power plants that promised to add megawatts to Californias power supply Thats why I signed it I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB just as I and every other governor in history signed other bills which though imperfect promised significant and needed beneficial change from the status quo which was certainly true of deregulation No one could have anticipated in the combination of factors less hydroelectric output in the West warmer summers sharply higher electricity demand constraints on natural gas supply that turned an electricity surplus into an electricity problem by The reason we will suffer power blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction allowed a problem to become a crisis Now the power crisis threatens to become a state fiscal crisis Governor Davis has been quoted as saying If I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes Sadly by temporizing on needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis he made crisis inevitable As a result California bonds have suffered two downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies and he has put in jeopardy state spending for parks schools transportation and other capital needs He has been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state budget The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years which gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation or the curtailment of production of natural gas which led to price spikes in recent years It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century It ignored a warning by the California Energy Commission of possible energy shortages by as early as And when possibility became hard hot reality in San Diego in it continued to ignore it putting in place a political palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem Fully a year ago or earlier had he chosen to do so Governor Davis could have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency including explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy These powers include the suspension of statute and regulation It was this power that I used after the Northridge earthquake in to rebuild and reopen Los Angeles shattered freeways just days after their destruction instead of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required by law Fully a year ago Davis could have acted unilaterally without the Legislature to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investorowned utilities PGE SCE and SDGE recently complain of but eagerly requested at the time of enactment He could have by decree suspended the provision that prohibited the utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers He could have by executive order suspended and truncated the nightmarish process required by state law for approval of siting Had he done so early enough when he might even have made a difference this summer and done so not just with peaker plants but also with large plants he might have greatly accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow us to escape from blackouts power price spikes and the severe job loss and economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither reliable nor affordable All these actions Governor Davis could have taken a year ago or earlier A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to prevent it He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it Had the governor heeded the early warnings about hot weather or the threat of insolvency to the utilities and had he acted using the full range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have he could have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast enough to avoid blackouts this summer PGE would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern California Edison would not be teetering on the brink Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers dollars And Californias jobs would not be threatened as they are by raiders from other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California employers to their states and steal our jobs The blame game waged by the governors office adds insult to injury It will provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer But it does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to mislead those who are not aware of the real unhappy facts of Californias present crisis The honest explanation for it is simple not rocket science State government cannot ignore the law of supply and demand It is not the states responsibility to build power plants But it is its responsibility to create a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers to do so Deregulation even with imperfections that the governor could have cured by fiat if the need arose was a significant advance in achieving that incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of Governor Davis failure to act That is the plain unhappy truth of the matter I take no joy in saying so I have been prepared to be helpful to the governor during this very serious challenge to our states wellbeing just as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition the school bond issue in the most recent election Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him then I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in order to shift the blame for his own inaction Pete Wilson is the former governor of California You can see this story at voicesnewsvoiceshtml

Consumer advocate revels in uphill battle Monday April San Francisco Chronicle Given a choice Nettie Hoge would rather be out in her garden right about now digging in the dirt Instead the head of The Utility Reform Network is digging into Californias energy mess making sure the average Joe doesnt take it in the kisser as lawmakers regulators and utility brass hats try to keep the lights on and utilities afloat Its grueling work full of long hours that leave precious little time for the gardening Hoge so adores Not that shes complaining Hoge honestly loves her job and insists she wouldnt do anything else Ive got a mutant gene she said with a laugh as she relaxed for just a moment in a spartan office littered with messy piles of paperwork Ive always wanted to do this TURN has been keeping tabs on companies like Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Pacific Bell for more than years Hoge and her crew lobby the Public Utilities Commission counsel lawmakers analyze reports and file the occasional lawsuit They are in short professional gadflies who represent the public in a system that some say favors big business The biggest protector of the consumer by far has been TURN said Bob Gnaizda public policy director for the Greenlining Institute in San Francisco Hoge has made TURN into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation Its not glamorous work nor is it particularly lucrative Hoge a lawyer by training took a pay cut when she accepted the ayear job in And truth be told most folks have no idea Hoge is in their corner There are other rewards she said You dont get the adoration of Joe Citizen standing up and yelling Yay TURN But theres an excitement about being involved in the discussions where the big decisions are made The youngest of four children Hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up following her career Army officer father from Kansas to Oklahoma to Texas All the places where you can shoot big guns she joked Hoge graduated from high school in Pullman Wash After a stint at the University of Southern California she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University and earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco Hoges entire career has been spent protecting the underdog During a two year stint as a law school graduate at Brobeck Phleger Harrison in San Francisco I got into trouble for doing too much pro bono work Hoge recalled The partners would come around each month to check our billable hours Mine were always zero Since taking the helm almost six years ago Hoge has led TURN to some impressive consumer victories They include persuading the Public Utilities Commission to create a million fund to underwrite rural telephone service and bringing an end to ratepayer subsidies of PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in Hoge a stickler for detail has a reputation for giving exhaustive answers to even mundane questions Everybody agrees she knows what shes talking about said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights In many respects TURN is the intellectual force in this debate Those of us who are deeply involved in this issue rely upon Nettie to lay out the facts for us Hoge is surprised people think her wonkish but admits she is circumspect My big fear is being marginalized and having people think we at TURN dont know what were talking about she said Maybe I overcompensate Few doubt Hoges smarts but she has plenty of critics among the utilities lawmakers and lobbyists she has crossed swords with over the years However none of them will say anything publicly We have no comment on her said Shawn Cooper a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Corp the parent company of the foundering utility It was the same story with Southern California Edison and many of the legislators who have criticized Hoge and TURN in recent years Hoge isnt surprised her adversaries are keeping mum Theres nothing for them to gain by saying anything negative about us because the public is on our side she said Still TURN has drawn criticism from Carl Wood generally considered the most ardent consumer advocate on the PUC Frankly I would have expected myself to be on the same page with TURN more than I actually am Wood said Im not sure they wholeheartedly believe in regulation and I think it comes from a distrust of regulators But maybe Im taking it personally Wood chastised TURN for supporting utility divestiture of generating plants as Californias deregulation effort got under way And he said Hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators The utilities have some culpability but they are not the main driver behind the crisis Wood said TURNs

Dale Kasler and John Hill Bee Staff Writers Published April Alarmed by the drain on Californias treasury from more than billion of electricity purchases a leading Wall Street credit agency lowered its rati ng on state bonds Tuesday Standard Poors downgraded Californias credit rating by two notches a move that will increase the states borrowing costs and illustrates a growi ng fear that the states power expenditures could mushroom during a summer of blackouts and price spikes Although the state remains creditworthy SP said it has less confidence in Californias ability to repay its debts It said the state could be downgraded further if electricity purchases spiral out of control and the economy suffers because of blackouts This reflects the mounting uncertainty and the cost to the state of the power purchases said SP analyst Steven Zimmermann The state is still strong its just not as strong going forward Bond ratings are a benchmark of a states finances and California official s have been proud of their ability to restore the states ratings since they bottomed out during the recession and budget deficits of the mids SP s downgrade is the first for California since July and comes as a slowdo wn in the hightech industry adds to the budgetary anxiety caused by electrici ty costs Still Gov Gray Davis office downplayed the significance of SPs decisio n Californias economy is still fundamentally strong period said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar We expect that in California will continue t o lead the nation in economic growth and job creation SP lowered California from AA to Aplus status That means California s debtpayment ability has been reduced from very strong to still strong but somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of the changes in circumstances and economic conditions While it wont directly hamper Davis plan for solving the energy crisis t he downgrade increases the pressure on Davis to issue billion to billi on worth of bonds this summer as part of his rescue package The bonds are intended to replenish the state treasury as well as finance future power purchases Since midJanuary the state has committed billion to buy electricity for troubled Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison The commitment has chewed up a significant portion of a budget surplus estimated by state Treasurer Phil Angelides at nearly billion Davis and other state officials have pegged the surplus at billion Either way its clear that the power expenditures have left Wall Street an d many state officials nervous SP and other rating agencies have had California on a ratings watch for some time signifying that a downgrade was possible The fact is that the states credit rating and financial strength will continue to be in jeopardy until the states general fund is repaid for energy costs said Angelides whos responsible for selling the bonds We have to get the general fund out of the business of purchasing energy The budgetary drain will begin to affect very dramatically the ability of the state to provide for core programs from education to health care to public safety Angelides spent much of the day urging legislators to pass legislation to g et the bond offering rolling The Legislature already authorized the bonds but Angelides said it must do so again because PGE and Edison are challenging the formula the state has developed for bond repayment The bond will be repaid with money from a rat e hike passed by state regulators but PGE and Edison say the repayment formula will siphon too much money from their coffers Angelides said lawmakers must quickly pass the new bill which requires a twothirds majority or he might miss a makeorbreak May deadline for closing on a crucial billion bridge loan That loan is designed to tid e the state over until the bonds are sold later this summer But the lenders wont fork over the funds until theyre assured the bonds will be sold because the state will use the bond proceeds in part to pay off that loan he said Ironically the sale of those bonds wont be hurt by the SP downgrade because customer revenue instead of taxpayer dollars are being used to pay them off analysts said Whats important for the bonds is how the utility rates are structured t o pay them off said analyst Susan Abbott of Moodys Inc in New York But the downgrade will raise the interest rate on a host of other bonds issued by the state in the coming months The likely increase is as much as onequarter of percent said chief economist Ted Gibson of the state Department of Finance With the state authorized to sell billion worth of general obligation bonds the downgrade could add million to million in borrowing cos ts over the life of those bonds Angelides said The SP action also could raise a red flag to anyone thinking of investing in a public or privatesector project in California It will create perception issues about who we are and where we are in term s of the economy of the state Angelides said The real issue here is the reputational damage to the state of California The two other leading credit agencies Moodys and Fitch Investors Service still have California on a credit watch but havent issued downgrades SP acted the same day the Independent System Operator which manages Californias power grid declared a Stage power alert Warm weather and t he unexpected shutdown of two key power plants caused electricity reserves to fall below percent The Bees Dale Kasler can be reached at or m Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Dan Smith contributed to this report Top energy adviser to quit as Davis pushes for plants Bee Capitol Bureau Published April John Stevens Gov Gray Davis staff director and top energy adviser is leaving the governors office at the end of the week Davis announced Tuesday Stevens of Carmichael joined the administration a year ago as staff director after working years as a top staffer in the Legislature including a stint as chief of staff to former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa He is the second top Davis adviser to leave in the past two weeks as the Democratic governor struggles to deal with Californias energy woes Like Phil Trounstine the governors communications director who announced his resignation two weeks ago Stevens said he needed more time with his family Its an immense issue he said of the energy crisis Ive given what I c an to it and I need to take a break Davis called Stevens one of the most dedicated and loyal people that Ive ever had working for me but acknowledged long hours and intensity to ok its toll This is tough work This wears people out Davis said Hes so selfdriv en that he needs a break but I venture a guess that down the road hell be willing to come back and help us in some meaningful way on this energy situation Davis also announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to head a Generation Implementation Task Force intended to speed up permitting and constructing power plants Sklar was the Clinton administrations representative in southeast Europe helping to rebuild wartorn Bosnia and Kosovo Senators offer bill to put a lid on power prices Sen Dianne Feinstein say s theres a good chance the proposal can get out of committee By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau Published April WASHINGTON West Coast senators formally introduced legislation Tuesday t o temporarily cap wholesale electric rates and expressed hope that their proposal to ease the huge runup in energy prices might clear the committee and make it to a vote on the Senate floor I think we are very close to having the votes in committee Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee tha t has jurisdiction over the bill I am taking nothing for granted but the committee is There are Democrats and Republicans on the committee including Feinstein and the other primary sponsor of the bill Oregon Sen Gordon Smith Smith a Republican is the swing vote Feinstein said the committee chairman Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska has shown an increasing willingness to help her and Smith move the legislation though some differences remain He Murkowski has told me hed like to help Feinstein said I think we are very close to a markup and this could move quickly Murkowski did not rule out price caps but said he thought the bill sacrific ed longterm solutions for shortterm gains I have concerns about the proposal put forward today and the impact it may have in distorting the market he said It is time to address the underlying causes not just the symptoms Feinsteins comments came at a news conference during which she Smith Washington state Democratic Sens Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and New Mexico Sen Jeff Bingaman the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee unveiled details of the bill and criticized the Bush administration and federal regulators for failing to take action to cap rates If approved by Congress and signed by President Bush the bill would give t he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission days to impose price caps or set up a costbased rate structure that would allow electricity generators to recove r their costs and earn a fair return The controls would apply in Western states including California Oregon and Washington Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives The lawmakers said the price controls would remain in effect until March when they said enough new generating plants will have come on line to overcome the Wests current electricity shortage Under federal law FERC has the authority to ensure wholesale rates are jus t and reasonable Feinstein said that during a warm day this summer California may fall megawatts short of meeting demand and on a hot day with air conditioners cranked up there could be a megawatt shortfall Feinstein said that in California utilities paid billion for electricity in more than billion and according to some estimates the price tag could reach billion this year There has been a very strong element of price gouging in this Feinstein said We should not have to pass legislation to compensate for a federal agency not doing its job Murray said adding that Northwest utilities were payin g the highest prices in the country for nextday delivery of wholesale power This bill will bring the market under control until new generation comes on line Cantwell who is also a committee member said wholesale rates have risen fold over the past several months resulting in thousands of layoffs in the region and the shutdown of the aluminum industry We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawe d and easily manipulated power market to wreak havoc on our economy and quali ty of life Cantwell said The Bonneville Power Administration has indicated it may have to raise its wholesale rates by percent this fall as it is forced to buy power on expensive spot markets because a severe drought in the Pacific Northwest ha s reduced electricity production at the regions vast hydropower system BPA supplies percent of the Northwests wholesale electricity Smith said that as a Republican he was initially reluctant to support pri ce control and would have preferred the market sort out its own problems But he said Hardnosed business practices that generate big profits are not always good politics Its a mistake to defend a system that some can game to make incredible profits The Oregon senator said he knew his decision to sponsor the bill was not wellreceived at the White House I know Im not making any friends down the street he said Its importa nt to keep this bipartisan and Im not going to attack the Bush administration Both Smith and Feinstein said a FERC staff proposal to cap wholesale electr ic rates in California when rolling blackouts are imminent falls well short of whats needed FERC will consider the proposal at a meeting today California is not the only state affected said Smith This is not a California problem alone Feinstein said the proposal was inadequate Im not sure that is the right way to go she said The only reason they are considering action is we are putting the heat on them The Bees Les Blumenthal can be reached at or Energy price gouging might end up felony By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published April Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price gouging a felony punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time tha t could be subject to the states controversial three strikes law The measure sponsored by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante would punish companies that sell electricity or natural gas in California at unjust or unreasonab le rates There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from California to five companies mostly in Texas Bustamante said If what theyre doing isnt illegal it ought to be Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday it already has generated opposition from Republican lawmakers and constitutional questions from legal experts Several aspects of the bill AB x are unresolved and could change But the intent will remain the same and energy companies that take advanta ge of Californians will still face significant penalties said the bills author Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza DMerced According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments a corporation or a person with decisionmaking authority at the corporation would be found guilty of a felony if they collude or conspire to manipulat e the market to achieve unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity or natur al gas A state or federal regulatory agency such as the Federal Energy Regulato ry Commission would determine whether rates were unjust or unreasonable If that happened the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state attorney general or local district attorneys In addition if found guilty companies would be forced to pay restitution and could face fines as high as percent of their gross corporate assets Lawmakers are debating whether to make the felony a three strikes offense which requires years to life sentences for some people convicted of thre e felonies Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill Cardoza said its not likely to show up in the final version While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin g money from a bank were going to have to figure out a little bit different way of dealing with it he said Even without the three strikes provision the bill raises certain constitutional issues said Clark Kelso a professor at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento For instance he said its not clear whether the state can legally base a fine on an outofstate companys gross assets And the measure which requires a twothirds vote for passage already has generated Republican opposition To the extent this bill is onerous toward power producers it may deter th em from selling here rather than risk fines and prison said James Fisfis a spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus We havent seen the details but it sounds like it may be a piece of legislation that goes too far The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Dan Walters Its time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis Published April Gov Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that hes on top of the states energy crisis and as he said at one gathering last week in three years this problem will be a distant memory Fat chance All major aspect s of the situation are growing worse not better minute by minute Politicians took over the crisis in January as the states major utilities exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit Davis began what he said then would be a shortterm emergency program of power purchases to keep electrons flowing into homes and businesses From that moment forward the situation has steadily deteriorated moving toward a threepronged disaster severe summer blackouts the bankruptcy of the utilities and sharply escalating power bills With the bankruptcy filin g by Pacific Gas and Electric Co and decisions by Davis and the state Public Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates two of the three negative scenarios are now in place And everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl e The Davis strategy if there is one is to continue the states massive pow er purchases while negotiating longerterm and presumably cheaper supply contracts encourage conservation help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch Currently the governor is touting his deal with Edison International pare nt company of Southern California Edison to sell its portion of the power gri d and is working on a similar deal with Sempra the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric But PGEs bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of the cashforgrid concept and legislators particularly Davis fellow Democrats are very skeptical of the Edison deal Clearly Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PGE made its bankruptcy filing in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latte r action but its provisions are being labeled a bailout by critics It place s only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing th e profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts Meanwhile the state is spending by Davis own account about million a day or billionplus a month on spot power purchases paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level An d the futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jum p percent by midsummer higher prices and greater purchases could increase the drain on the state treasury to as much as billion a month State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a bridge lo an to relieve pressure on the states rapidly vanishing reserves but Wall Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of whats happenin g and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature Meanwhile bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities Davis for some reason is unwilling to declare this situation the emergenc y that it is truly becoming one that could take a toll on human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners respirators and traffic lights He insists on issuing his periodic and wholly unrealistic assurances that things will turn out all right even declaring to reporters on Tuesday We think well have this thing licked by the end of fall Its time for someone the governor preferably but someone to lay ou t for Californians exactly whats happening the downside financial and power supply risks and whats being done to deal with the looming disaster facin g this state Its time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans The Bees Dan Walters can

Legislature poor marks for handling the electricity crisis downgrading state bonds because of the drain on the state treasury and warning of longterm damage to the state economy The bad news from Standard Poors came as state Treasurer Phil Angelides urged the Legislature to pass a bill this week needed to begin repaying the state general fund with a bond of billion or more The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over years From a small problem that could have been solved in a short period of time this is escalating into a big problem said David Hitchcock of Standard Poors Even if they issue revenue bonds it could stay with them for a lo ng period of time Standard Poors lowered its rating on state of California general obligation bonds from AA to A which means it will cost the state more to borrow money The firm left California on credit watch with a negative outlook a ranking applied after the state began buying power for utility customers in January The state general fund has spent more than billion buying power so far There are predictions that spending will sharply increase this summer as he at drives up the demand for electricity The fact is we cant allow the general fund to be depleted Angelides said There are limits to it It will begin to affect very dramatically th e ability of the state to provide core programs for education health care public safety

agency says WHATS NEXT Davis representatives continue negotiating with Sempra the parent co mpany of San Diego Gas and Electric Co to buy the utilitys transmission lines Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Whole sale Energy Market continues its investigation Thursday Standard Poors said that if the sale of a state revenue bond is delayed the potential impact on the state general fund could be severe without a rate hike much larger than the increase of more than percent approved by the state Public Utilities Commission last month Rate increases appear difficult in the present political environment and related voter initiatives although none are currently on the ballot remai n a possibility said Standard Poors The state began buying power after the two largest utilities Pacific Gas a nd Electric and Southern California Edison were nearly bankrupt The rates th ey could charge customers were frozen under deregulation as the cost of wholesale power soared producing a debt of billion Standard Poors said the state expected in January to spend less than billion and resolve the problem in a few months with longterm power contracts at lower prices But most of the contracts do not begin until thi s fall or later In addition said Standard Poors it is not unreasonable to expect pa st and future blackouts to affect business location decisions and hence the ultimate direction of the states economy A spokesman for the governor said that Standard Poors view of how the California economy will fare during the electricity crisis is far too dim Californias economy is still fundamentally strong said spokesman Roger Salazar We expect that in we will continue to lead the nation in economic growth and job creation Another Wall Street creditrating firm Moodys has a more positive view o f how the governor and the Legislature have handled the crisis and expects th e state general fund to be repaid by the ratepayer bond We are still at our AA with a negative outlook said Ray Murphy Moodys vice president Nothing that we have learned over the last week or so has led us to change that opinion Angelides said legislation is needed because PGE and Edison are challengin g a PUC action last month that gives the state some revenue from monthly ratepayer bills which is needed to finance the bond to repay the state general fund The utilities say they need more of the ratepayer revenue The treasurer said the legislation would bypass the lengthy PUC process and authorize the state to issue a ratepayer bond of billion or more The governor said again yesterday that he believes a bond of billion will cover state power costs this year Angelides said legislation is urgent because a commitment from three lender s to give the state a billion shortterm loan expires May He said the shortterm bridge loan would ease the strain on the state gener al fund until the main bond can be issued probably in late June The treasurer said that failure to obtain the shortterm loan could lead to more credit downgrades and create perception issues about who we are and where we are in terms of the economy of this state Davis has been criticized on Wall Street for not pushing for an early rate hike to stabilize the utilities and avoid the need for the state to begin buying power The governor said earlier this year that he could have solved the problem i n minutes with a rate hike but refused to do so While addressing the California Chamber of Commerce yesterday Davis said that the longterm contracts will spread the cost of buying power over a decade causing ratepayers to pay less than market rates in the early years and a little above the market rate in later years I do not want to shock this economy into recession Davis said I do not want to burden small business with more than they can sustain Davis wants the state to purchase the transmission systems of the utilities in exchange for giving them part of the ratepayer revenue to finance a bond to pay off their debts That would enable the utilities to resume buying power by the end of next year But negotiations to buy the transmission systems has taken much longer than expected PGE filed for bankruptcy earlier this month and an agreement to buy the Edison transmission system announced a few days later faces opposition in the Legislature Some legislators who think Edison receives too much under the complex agreement have suggested that Edison join PGE in bankruptcy where generators accused of pricegouging may not have all of their bills paid If they go into bankruptcy the state will be buying power for three or fo ur years Davis told the Chamber yesterday That is all we will be doing up here A Stage emergency alert was called yesterday when two power plants unexpectedly stopped operating with temperatures around the state rising Meanwhile Davis announced that Richard Sklar a former ambassador to the wartorn Balkans will lead a task force to speed up the construction of ne w power plants The governor acknowledged while speaking to reporters that he has not met h is earlier goals of avoiding blackouts rate increases and keeping the utiliti es out of bankruptcy This is probably the most complicated challenge the state has faced in years Davis said But we are providing steady and reliable leadership a nd I believe we will have this thing behind us by the end of this fall FERC to weigh limited curbs on electricity prices Caps would apply in Stage shortages By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE April CALIFORNIAS POWER CRISIS WASHINGTON Federal regulators are expected to consider limited wholesale price curbs for Californias chaotic electricity market today but the approach falls far short of the controls sought by many state officials Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staffers have proposed limiting the price that power sellers can charge for wholesale electricity in California only during the most severe shortages known as Stage emergencies The price mitigation would be pegged to the marginal cost of the highestpriced generating unit called upon to run according to a staff report Producers also would be required to sell their excess power to the states grid operator The price controls would last one year and would not apply to other Western states suffering from gyrations in power costs and electricity shortages FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has been an implacable foe of price controls b ut is under considerable political pressure to do more to help California as t he peak powerconsuming summer months approach Commissioner William Massey ha s advocated farreaching price limits while Commissioner Linda Breathitt has wavered on the issue Gov Gray Davis and other California officials have called for broad price controls that also would include other Western states Yesterday Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif formally introduced legislation that would require FERC to impose regional price limits through March Feinstein said the FERC staff proposal was inadequate Once you put the cap just on Stage you force the heavier pricing on stages and she said Other critics have noted that wholesale power prices in California are abnormally high during periods other than Stage emergencies Feinsteins legislation first outlined in March would require FERC to set price caps or impose costbased rates that would limit prices to the cost of producing the power plus a set profit margin New generating plants and power bought through longterm contracts would be exempt However any state covered by the price controls would have to allow utilities to recover their wholesale power costs from consumers The clause helped draw a Republican cosponsor to the bill Sen Gordon Smith of Orego n Smith and other Western lawmakers have complained about the reluctance of California officials to raise retail rates while consumers in neighboring states have seen their power bills soar In recent months the California Public Utilities Commission twice has increased rates for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric the utilities hit hardest by skyrocketing wholesale power prices The FERC staff proposal rejected price caps or costbased rates It would be hard to devise price caps that are low enough to provide price relief but high enough to adequately compensate generators the proposal said The Bush administration and top congressional Republicans are opposed to price controls so it is uncertain how far Feinsteins legislation will get Grid officials declare a Stage alert ASSOCIATED PRESS April SACRAMENTO The states electric grid operator declared a Stage power alert Tuesday after two power plants suddenly went offline Higherthanforecasted temperatures in Southern California also caused dema nd to increase said Lorie ODonley spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator keeper of the state power grid A Stage alert is declared when electricity reserves fall or are expected to fall below percent The two power plants that went offline had been producing about megawatts or roughly enough power for homes We think we may need to request interruptible customers but barring any other big problems we probably wont need to go to a Stage said ODonley Stage alerts are called when the reserves drop below percen t and could result in rolling blackouts like the state has seen on four days since January The ISO said megawatts were unavailable Tuesday morning because of power plants that were down for scheduled or unplanned maintenance Another megawatts from alternative generators such as solar wind and geothermal was also not available ODonley said About half of the alternative generators say they cant afford to keep operating because they are owed about billion by Pacific Gas and Electri c Co and Southern California Edison Top credit agency lowers Californias bond rating ASSOCIATED PRESS April SACRAMENTO A top credit agency lowered its rating on California state bonds Tuesday citing the growing financial drain from the continuing energy emergency The downgrade reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the state of the current electrical power crisis as well as its likely longterm detrimenta l effect on the states economy Standard and Poors said The states ability to repay is debts has been reduced though it is still adequate SP said It dropped the rating on general obligation bonds from doubleA to singleAplus It similarly revised other lease ratings and ratings for th e California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund known as Cal Mortgage SP said it didnt drop the rating farther because the state still has mone y because of Californias diverse economy and because a proposed revenue bon d is slated to reimburse the states treasury for money California is current ly using to buy power for two financially strapped utilities If the state cant quickly sell its revenue bond the impact on the treasur y could be severe unless electricity rates are substantially increased beyond the large increases already scheduled to kick in SP warned SP has had the states general obligation bonds on a creditwatch with negative implications since January when the state began buying power for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric States Bond Rating Downgraded to A Finance Reduction of notches puts it among states with the lowest credit ratings Move could cost California hundreds of millions in borrowing fees By LIZ PULLIAM WESTON and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers A major credit rating agency downgraded billion of California bond s Tuesday in a move that could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the states borrowing costs and saddles California with one of the lowest state credit ratings in the nation Standard Poors Corp cut Californias bond rating by two notches from AA to Aplus citing the mounting and uncertain cost of the current electrical power crisis which has forced the state to spend billions on electricity to keep the lights on SP one of three major rating agencies monitoring Californias financial health said a further downgrade could occur if the state fails t o follow through on plans to issue at least billion in revenue bonds to help pay off energyrelated debts SP is saying We dont have any faith that what you say youre goin g to do youre going to do said Zane Mann publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor a newsletter that tracks government debt Wall Street is concerned by delays surrounding the electricity bond issue but lawmakers hope to pass legislation this week to put the bond iss ue on a fast track and speed up return of the money to the states general fun d Credit ratings help determine how much states and other borrowers have to pay when issuing bonds The lower the rating the higher the interest ra te the state must pay to entice investors to buy The state Treasurers Office concluded in a preliminary estimate that as a result of the downgrade California could have to pay million to million more on the billion in general obligation bonds the state has authorized to pay for ongoing expenses such as school and roadbuilding projects but has yet to issue State revenue bonds should not be affected by the downgrade the officials said However some bond experts disagree Californias energy crisis already has driven down prices of a wide range of the states bonds from general obligation issues that depend on t he states ability to repay to small issues by school districts and cities tha t could be hurt by rising electricity prices Bond traders said SPs downgra de probably would cause prices to fall further All California bond holders are going to lose value in their bonds because the states credit has been downgraded said John Fitzgerald managing partner of SeidlerFitzgerald a Los Angeles municipal debt underwriter The downgrade most affects investors who want to sell their bonds now before the issues mature Investors who hold onto their bonds are still almost certain to get the face value when their securities reach maturity because the state is unlikely to miss any interest payments or otherwise default on its bonds traders said SP analysts said the states continuing surplus and deep and diverse economy helped prevent a further downgrade Still the downgrade places California below most other states on SP s rating scale and on par with Hawaii Among states rated by SP only Louisiana has a lower rating at Aminus according to Bloomberg News In addition the two other major credit rating agencies have indicated they may downgrade Californias bonds Fitch Inc said last week that it wa s contemplating such a move and Moodys Investors Service earlier this month changed its outlook on California bonds to negative from stable Some politicians Tuesday accused SP of overreacting Its just unfair premature and inappropriate for them to do that We do have reserves we do have good revenue projections we do have a plan to get us out of this said Assemblyman Gil Cedillo DLos Angeles In a statement Gov Gray Davis said Californias economy is still fundamentally strong period We expect that in we will continue to le ad the nation in economic growth and job creation State Treasurer Phil Angelides has been pleading with lawmakers to pas s legislation to speed up repayment of billion drained from the states general fund to buy electricity this year That figure is expected to reach billion by years end according to the governor The consequences of a downgrade are profound Angelides said noting that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the recession of the early s It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly establish our legal authority to sell bonds and replenish the states gener al fund Angelides said California began buying massive quantities of electricity in January because the states three major investorowned utilities could no longer afford to do so Since then the state has been purchasing roughly onethir d of the electricity the utilities need to service their customers according to state officials Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis the general fund is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with what is expected to be the largest municipal bond issue in US history Th e bond issue is to be repaid by utility ratepayers through a monthly charge o n their electricity bills However obstacles that threaten timely repayment of the fund are causing consternation among Wall Street analysts about Californias financi al status The bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas Electric Co the states large st investorowned utility has thwarted the states plan to restore the utilities to financial health But it is a dispute over the states formula for repaying the bonds th at has raised the most concern among state officials The state and the utilities are at odds over how much of consumers electricity payments shou ld go to reimburse the state for its power purchases The states two major utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison have challenged the Public Utilities Commissions plan f or splitting up the moneya legal move that threatens to delay issuance of th e bonds The firms contend the allotment granted to the state is too generous and could make it harder for them to recover from the energy crisis Hoping to sidestep the controversy Angelides is urging state lawmaker s to pass an emergency measure this week that sets the bond amount and the amount the state will receive from utility payments The revenue bond was initially expected to be billion but the Davis administration has sinc e proposed a billion issue Times staff writers James Flanigan Jenifer Warren and Julie Tamaki contributed to this report Copyright Los Angeles Times Price Controls Spark Deja Vu Energy The specter of Richard Nixons actions years ago hangs over current debate on how to check the states surging power costs By JAMES F PELTZ Times Staff Writer A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be adopted to stem the states soaring power costs and help consumers who are bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in economicsand in politics for that matter And now the caps are more in dispute than ever because they run counter to the nations move over the la st two decades to deregulate more and more industries from airlines to railroads to energy Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire so controls are again being demanded by lawmakers consumer advocates and othe rs as a way to check surging prices On the other side is a chorus of critics who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and at times making matters worse for consumers Case in point the Golden State itself which tried last summer to use temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state thus widening the imbalance between supply and demand reinforcing the existing shortages and contributing to this winters rolling blackouts But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke t had no way to selfcorrect The utilities couldnt simply refuse to buy electricity in the face of higher prices and with no price ceiling in sigh t something had to be done And now Gov Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary controls until more electricity supplies can be added especially as the state enters the peakpower summer season On Tuesday Sens Dianne Feinste in DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre introduced legislation that would impo se price controls on wholesale energy throughout Western states Mindful of the controversial history of controls Feinstein and Smith stressed that the caps would last only through March But they also argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls I have a strong preference for markets but its a mistake to believe that we have a free market when it comes to energy said Smith the only G OP cosponsor of the legislation Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whi ch regulates US wholesale electricity prices either to impose a regional price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator tying the price of electricity to the cost of producing it Coincidentally FERC today is expected to decide on various other proposals to again limit Californias power costsbut without explicitly stating that the plans include price controls Why Because the Bush administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr among others are on the record as adamantly opposing price caps Thats not surprising Price controls often are tagged as a liberal maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives freemarket ideology Yet ironically hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica n president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide level Richard M Nixon The late president took that rare step years ago this August to try to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound His actions were so dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or in some cases endorse setting limits on prices What he did is almost larger than life now said Shannon Burchett chief executive of RiskLimited Corp a strategic consulting firm in Dallas Nixons controls were the most farreaching since World War II when prices were capped so that profiteers couldnt reap huge sums for scarce commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home In most cases price controls have been much less sweeping and targete d at specific products or services They dont always involve changing the la w either In President Kennedy publicly rebuked the thenUS Steel Cor p and its chairman Roger Blough for starting an industrywide move to raise steel prices The price hikes were rolled back a few days later Since Nixon price controls have become rarer as industries that were once regulatedwhich means their prices were governmentcontrolledhave been deregulated So it is in California where electric utilities prices were controll ed for decades until the states deregulation law in But now that the la w has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices power shortages crippled utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers costs some again wan t price controls on electricity until the crisis eases Which brings everyone back to Nixon Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan Ive heard people make the analogy to what happened when Nixon put on controls but in California this is fundamentally different said Mike Florio a board member of the California Independent System Operator which oversees most of the states electricity grid When you get into a situation of shortage of supplies there is really no restraint at all on prices said Florio who said he normally prefers unfettered markets but also defended the states caps last summer Such government intervention on a temporary basis is better than nothing but I dont think its ideal The reverberations from Nixons fiat arent just felt in California either When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe nt controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state critics promptly pointed to Nixons controls They were a disaster one columnist wrote Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who was in the private sector in the early s turned down several requests to take highlevel White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixons price contro ls Many economists and historians also judge Nixons controls as a mistak e But some maintain that his decisionwhich began with a day freeze on prices wages and rentswasnt entirely a failure and even provided shock value that for a while at least arrested higher inflation In addition part of Nixons move involved taking the dollar off the gold standardwhich in effect meant its price was controlledand letting it float in value against other major currencies And that many believe is t he base upon which todays global financial markets operate Others disagree There really isnt an example of where theyve price controls worked said Robert Goldberg a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis a nonpartisan think tank in New York Controls always lead to an underproduction of the commodity involved because producers dont have any incentive to spend more on additional output he said When the caps ultimately are lifted prices typically soar anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the controls were in place Goldberg added Others note that although most of Nixons price controls lasted only a couple of years various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga n In the meantime the controlsaggravated by embargoes and other suppl y cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesdistorted the fr ee market for energy critics say The controls kept US oil prices artificially low which in turn kept demand for oil high giving OPEC more power over world production and prices in the s they contend Nonetheless proponents keep calling for controls when prices for certain items seem to be spiraling out of control Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems President Clintons massive healthreform proposal in the early s included price controls on drugs But the idea set off howls of protest fro m the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and ultimately the entire proposal was shelved Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal controls on rising cable TV rates in and again contending that t he cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their subscribers but specific price caps werent enacted But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi ze that electricity isnt in the same category as an airplane seat steel or other commodities that dont have to be bought if the price soars too high In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly to changes in supply and demand but in electric generation in California it cant said Flori o who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network a consumer group For most products one of the ways prices get determined is if buye rs refuse to buy when the price gets too high But thats generally not an option for people when it comes to electricity Critics of Californias attempt to cap prices last summer said the controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to other states That actually made the tightsupply problem worse in California by driving imports out of the state the Bay Area Economic Forum a research group funded by regional business and government agencies said in a report last week Indeed the temporary caps were basically abandoned by years end to keep enough electricity in the state Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor who heads the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee said there are ways to mitigate the states power prices without having to set rigid controls One proposal Have FERC require that generators supply of the ir expected future sales to California under longterm contracts at just and reasonable prices set by the federal agency he said That would send the right price signal to suppliers to come into th e state Wolak said And because it will take time for California to get more of its own powergenerating plants up and running the states electricity crisis isn t unlike a natural disaster in which normal public service is disrupted and shortterm controls serve a purpose Florio said Over time market forces will work and controls shouldnt be need h

emissions according to preliminary figures from the South Coast Air Quality Management District As a group the plants emitted a total of tons of smogforming nitrogen oxide in the first three month s

peak summer demand because they are inefficient and costly Glendale like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power continues to produce electricity at its cityowned plant The three cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation a decision that has shielded their residents by and large from the huge utility rate hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere But they also will contribute to easing the states energy emergency in the dirtier air they will be forced to breathe Airquality officials said power plants contribute just about of th e tons of pollution emitted into the air daily with about of the pollution coming from vehicles not factories And in recent years many of the regions municipal power generators have been updated with

We want to know if it is impacting our kids in ways we wont know about until years from now said Janette Mortimer w ho lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes closest to the plant Already residents say the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow There are the earringing rumbles and roars There are the mysterious plume s of smoke that waft over the neighborhood Then there is the grime that seem s never to go away If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES the facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory Officials said the plants previous owner Southern California Edison typically ran it at of capacity AES could be allowed to run the four gasfired boilers and a peaker unit whenever California hits a Stage alertwhich is expected to happen often this summer The peaker plant alone is powered by eight jet enginesand sounds like it Currently only two boilers are operating But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and the water they swim in Under the fasttracking process designed to get more electricity for t he state as soon as possible several key environmental questions have yet to be studied Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of Huntington Beachs shoreline in the summer of said that the plant alo ng with other factors played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that is discharged miles offshore back toward the coast AES Inc will pay million to further study the issue but the research wont be complete for some time So much is uncertain said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff These are big big things For now residents say they are bracing for more noise smoke and disruption To begin with AES proposal calls for hours a day of nonstop construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures Residents usually ope n their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes But the noise and smells from the plants may make that impossible Its going to be bad Theres no escape said Bryan Visnoski The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly years The housing tracts came later but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a nd surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor Some have installed doublepaned windows to dampen the sound Others have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views The Mortimers grew tall trees and trained vines past the windows The problems they say began with the energy crisis The plant was owned by Edison until when it was sold to AESCalifornias largest private electricity producerat the dawn of deregulation The two gasfired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant since and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state Gov Gray Dav is signed an executive order allowing peaker plants to operate at extended hours Peaker plants can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle large amounts of natural gas and are noisy Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou d jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport Whenever the peaker plant goes on residents call the Air Quality Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke The inspections have not detected any violations The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from megawatts to megawatts The companys two yearold units represent about of the additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal l this summer Despite the fasttracking process the company has vowed that it would safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant operations If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore AES woul d have to pay the

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL As federal energy regulators consider a plan intended to ease the states worsening energy crisis California officials and some energy experts are already criticizing it as inadequate The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled today to debate a proposal that would force power generators to sell electricity at a discounted price to California during severe power emergencies The proposal would require producers to sell energy to the states power gr id during Stage emergencies Stage emergencies are declared when energy resources are almost depleted allowing utilities to cut off power to customers at any time The plan also would limit how much energy firms could profit off such sales But Gov Gray Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein among others say stronger remedies including the temporary regional price limits they have advocat ed for months are needed to stave off a summer of blackouts and power shortages I think the plan before FERC is too little too late Davis said yesterda y in Sacramento We need help all the time The regulatory commission plan excludes percent of the purchases of power A Stage situation is by definition chaotic as we scramble to find the megawatts to keep the lights on The commission ordered its staff in December to come up with remedies to Californias energy woes The commissioners are expected to make their decision by May a selfimposed deadline to help the Golden State The proposal to be debated today would require producers to sell electricit y to California at a price based on the costs of the leastefficient plant providing the energy More efficient plants sending energy to the state wou ld still be able to make a sizable profit The plan has also drawn criticism because it applies only to California no t other Western states that are also feeling the pinch of higher energy price s But California officials say the proposal does signal a shift in the hard line position of the commissions majority against any form of price controls The plan would set some form of price ceiling even if only durin g extreme conditions In regulatory commission documents the plan is referred to as price mitigation not price limits I sincerely dont believe that FERC would even be considering the Stage if it were not for us making substantial noise about a temporary cap said Feinstein DCalif who introduced a bill with other Western senators yesterday to require the agency to impose temporary price controls on energ y sold to Western states Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute said the regulatory commission has yet to make a compelling case for why its Stage plan would help lower skyhigh prices The argument being made to support this is that

Writer Wednesday April San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL Citing the rapidly escalating uncertainty surrounding the power crisis Standard Poors slashed Californias credit rating yesterday for the firs t time since when the state was still climbing out of a recession The downgrade and the energy debacle that led up to it will cost taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the states borrowing costs Investors will probably see the market price of California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further But the biggest blow may be to the states ego SP downgraded the states general obligation bonds two notches to A from AA The only other state currently rated A is Hawaii The only state with a lower credit rating is Louisiana according to SP Most states are rated AA Some states dont have a credit rating because th ey dont have bonds Californias credit rating is still investment grade which means it is n ot expected to default on its bonds However the states ability to repay its debt isnt as strong as it used to be said Steve Zimmermann a managing director with Standard Poors This is a very speculative situation States hire companies like SP to give them an independent credit rating wh en they borrow money by selling bonds The rating reflects the states ability to repay its debt in full on time When they sell new bonds states with lower credit ratings usually pay high er interest than higherrated states to make up for the added risk A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that have already been issued but it can affect the price of bonds when they trade on the open market among investors Yesterdays downgrade reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat e of the current electrical power crisis as well as its likely longterm detrimental effect on the states economy SP said in a news release Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund balances the state typically budgets the capacity to pay debt service whi le still adequate has been reduced In January SP placed the states debt on CreditWatch with negative implications a signal that it might lower the rating In an unusual move SP kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterdays downgrade which means the rating could fall even lower Zimmermann said SP is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit y to sell billion to billion worth of bonds to reimburse the states general fund for past and future power purchases If they did the bond issue theyd replenish the fund at least for the short term If they dont do it then its more of a concern Zimmermann said Unfortunately the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the bonds If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade they would have had a stronger deal said Kelly Mainelli a municipal bond fund manag er with Montgomery Asset Management California must obtain an investmentgrade rating BBB or higher on the bonds before it can sell them Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in anticipation of a ratings cut When prices fall bond yields go up The downgrade is the culmination of everything thats happened since early December he said In November California municipal bonds yields were to percentage points below the national average Today theyre to percentage points above the national average and Mainelli thinks they could go up to percentage points more because of the downgrade The total difference about percentage points doesnt sound like much but it adds up Last year the state itself sold billion in new bonds excluding bonds sold to replace existing bonds If it sells the same amount this year plu s billion in energy bonds that percentage point difference on billion in bonds would cost the state million a year in additional interest costs Yesterdays downgrade only affected the states general obligation bonds an d others secured by the full faith and credit of the state such as the California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund Cal Mortgage But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i n California such as cities counties school and water districts more money when they sell bonds Although their ratings have not changed because of the energy crisis analysts say the yields on most California municipal bonds have gone up and will go up some more as a result of the states downgrade The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade whether they should be or not Psychologically its just how the market reacts says Richard Goldstein a San Ramon financial planner Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before they mature may not get all their principal back But investors who hold their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full Goldstein said No matter how bad the energy crisis gets most experts believe the state wi ll continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds even if it ha s to raise taxes cut expenditures or run a temporary deficit to do so Theres also the prospect at some point of federal help Goldstein said The federal government does not want California to default or even come close Do you know what that would do to the national economy and the world economy Californias bondrating history SP cut its rating on California debt yesterday for the first time since What credit ratings mean AAA Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments AA Very strong capacity to meet financial commitments A Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat more susceptible to adverse circumstances and economic conditions BBB Adequate capacity to meet financial commitments However adverse economic conditions could weaken ability to pay debts Note Ratings below BBB are considered poor investment risks and the issue s sometimes are called

cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTL PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Some key power generators say Californias dearth of energy supplies and its growing demand make it a good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come even if dreaded price caps are imposed Regardless of what the market structure turns out to be the states going to need electricity and its going to need to buy it from somebody said Bill Highlander spokesman for San Josebased Calpine Corp Calpine is investing about billion in power plants over the next four years that will generate megawatts enough for more than million homes The states current energy crisis hasnt really changed our plans or our strategy he said But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa le electricity will hinder not help Californias energy crisis Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay will invest in other states warns Hebert the chairman of the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission And any regulations that cut into future profits wil l scare away desperately needed new power plants he says Eight of the new power plants approved in California already are under construction Twelve more are under review according to the California Energy Commission which approves power plants CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said thats a huge boost over the last decade when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation not a threat of price ca ps kept applications down No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant s since December The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s o low you couldnt make a profit Schlichting said Its still a market that people seem to want to come in and produce power for Other companies still planning to invest in California include North Carolinabased Duke Energy which has two plants in the works and Houstonbased Reliant Energy which is negotiating with the state to sell power on longterm contracts Reliants spokesman Richard Wheatley wouldnt say whether price caps alon e would inhibit them from building more plants What he did say is that Californias power politics leave a lot of room for improvement The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an d implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away Meanwhile Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations If California wants to encourage construction its got to tone down its vilification and stop adding more restrictions Wheatley said Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant we have to look at the economics of the facility we have to look at the regulatory situation esoteric things like what the mindset is like he said California is not the easiest place in which to do business Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines gas reserves and plants already under construction that its folly to turn back now We want to build in California but we need to have regulatory stability or at least regulatory clarity to move these things forward because theyre halfbillion dollar projects in some cases said Tom Williams a spokesma n for Duke Thats a lot of bananas Senators Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre plan this we ek to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t he Western states They hope to keep prices down in the shortterm and give California and other troubled states a breather to make longterm decisions Feinsteins bill does not yet specify a price Some economists say to per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable yet provide generators a profit Prices have gone as high as for the same amount of power in the past year Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for generators to swallow said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Berkeleys energy institute Such a cap would account for variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera te much of the energy in Californias power plants Price caps can be effective but only if they are very carefully designed warned Frank Wolak chairman of the Independent System Operators market surveillance committee The ISO manages the states power grid Set them too high and companies will only bid that amount saving little money Wolak said Too low and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe re unless all other nearby states have the same price limits Also capping the most expensive energy sales power sold on the spot market at times of high demand wont lower prices for other key componen ts of the states energy supply such as electricity bought for the next days power needs Suppose youre paying every single megawatt hour That still puts us in big trouble with wholesale energy costs Wolak said The state already has spent billion buying power for customers of Californias three largest investorowned utilities which lost their credi t and thus their ability to buy power after paying sharply higher costs for wholesale energy Borenstein said paying even a megawatt hour is still preferable to the unknown particularly since economists have warned that there is virtually no upper limit to what energy companies can charge This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th e price is going to be at the price cap and if we dont have a price cap th ey will be way above the price cap Borenstein said FERC remains opposed to price caps but after months of complaints the boa rd this week is considering a limited cap on the most expensive lastminute power buys The proposal would cap California but not the rest of the West and order wholesalers to sell to the state during the most extreme power shortages Though it provides some cushioning it does not address the high prices California swallows the rest of the time Thats the point of Feinsteins bill The crisis point is this summer to next summer and we need some federal assistance said Howard Gantman spokesman for Feinstein This would assure the generators a reasonable profit and continue to spur on further investment into new plants On the Net California Energy Commission wwwenergycagov

bonds two notches from AA to A with a negative outlook That puts California near the bottom of the state bond heap with only one state Louisiana rated lower Standard Poors said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv e the power crisis The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener al obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction The interest on those bonds which will rise from an estimated to perhaps percent is paid from the states taxfinanced general fund Although the rating change doesnt apply technically to the different type of bond t he state plans to issue by June for power purchases it will probably make tho se bonds more expensive for the state too bond experts say Heightened urgency Theres a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating particularly since the PGE bankruptcy said David Hitchcock California analyst for Standard Poors This problem could move quickly At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising To me its clear that SP doesnt have much faith in this powerbailout plan of the Legislature and the governor To me thats the reason they did it said Zane Mann publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor newsletter No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade Hitchcock said The major factor he said was simply spiraling costs and no longterm plan for paying the bills Last week Gov Gray Davis said the state had been spending million a day to buy electricity up from million a day in late March Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are higher All three major Wall Street creditrating agencies have California on socalled credit watch but only Standard Poors has downgraded One municipal bond expert said Standard Poors had been trigger happy and eager to downgrade Raymond Murphy Moodys California analyst said he had no immediate plans to change Californias

want the state to develop the plan that gets the general fund out of power purchasing Murphy said The state says its working on that but theres a roadblock Revenue bonds A major piece of the states plan is to have the Department of Water Resources issue billion to billion in revenue bonds to pay back the general fund for what has been taken to buy power in recent months But tha t portion of the plan is tied up in a dispute between PGE and the California Public Utilities Commission over how to spend the extra money generated by electricity rate increases The dispute has also held up the billion in financing the state had arranged to pay down the advances it took out of th e general fund to buy power To break the logjam officials from the state treasurers office have asked lawmakers to pass emergency legislation to allow the state to issue the revenue bonds Californias credit rating and financial strength will be in jeopardy unt il the states general fund is repaid for energy costs state Treasurer Phil ip Angelides said in a statement Tuesday State Finance Director Tim Gage and Gov Davis both downplayed the significance of the rate change Through a press officer Davis said the states economy remains fundamentally strong The state was downgraded to a lower A rating in and went on to see tremendous economic growth Mounting pressure Still a downgrade is bad news that sends a psychological signal in both th e finance and real worlds Some industry watchers said they hope the downgrad e pushes lawmakers and state officials whom they perceive to be too slow in responding to the crisis It sounds like the bond market might be out ahead of some of the policymakers in California said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute Were facing a real emergency here John Hallacy managing director of municipal research at Merrill Lynch sai d a lower credit rating puts more pressure on the state to issue the revenue bonds fast and to conserve

Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network and a leading critic of the states efforts to bail out PGE and Southern California Edison the downgrade means the analysts are watching She said she hopes that President Bush and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are watching too Hopefully this is a wakeup call for FERC Those guys could solve this i n a nanosecond Hoge said This is just another milepost on the downward spiral to economic catastrophe Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at or QA with Gov Gray Davis on energy issues Gov Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday On the subject of electricity Davis talked about increasing the number of power plants the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the condition of the states two largest utilities Souther n California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Davis has proposed a deal to rescue Edison and the Legislature is considering it PGE has filed for bankruptcy Here is a condensed version of Davis remarks Q What would you like to say by way of introduction about the states electricity problems Davis There are really two problems One is the amount of power available and the other is the price of power In well have more megawatts on line at least more By well have a slight excess of power over demand Thats very important Because at the moment we import percent of our power We have no leverage We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy That will never change until we have more power than we need OK price As you know the only entity that can influence the wholesale price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that In this state for all power including municipal power spent roughly billion In we spent billion I dont know what it will be this year but it will be substantially higher Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do a thing zero zippo Lest you think Im being partisan that commission consists entirely of Clinton appointees The final piece is the financial consequences of whats happened to date I t is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison creditworthy an d able to reenter the power purchasing market Jan we can then go t o the PGE creditors committee the generators to whom PGE owes money and s ay to them Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison We believe that this is a far better deal than PGE can give you I think this is a fair plan We get every electron that Edisons utility ow ns committed for years at a costofservice basis Under current law the y could sell that next March at market rates We got million returned fr om the holding company a billion investment in the transmission and delive ry systems a permanent easement on about acres of environmental property around all their hydro facilities Q Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin g in the electric system What will it look like in a couple of years Davis It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power entirely commencing Jan Our goal is to get them back in business In addition to investorowned utilities I believe we also need a public power authority At some point I believe the private sector will say to itself I want to build new plants to replace the yearold plants but do I really want to get the state to a percent margin over supply there by reducing the value of the electrons I already own If they do God bless them But if they dont at least well have the opportunity to build them ourselves Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand the spot market prices will come down dramatically Q You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem in minutes if youd been willing to raise rates Now rates are going to be raised Should you have favored a rate increase earlier Davis I should have been more specific I should have said I could have solved it in minutes if I wanted to triple rates I think the rate increase I proposed is fair It rewards people who are the most energy efficient the people who only use up to percent of their baseline The y are approximately half the state So half the state will see no rate increase beyond the percent that everyone saw in January Q Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on o r at some point would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a blackout Davis We have to provide power There are many people who have medical devices that have to keep running Blackouts can cause deaths traffic accidents all kinds of calamities that I wouldnt want to happen Im reluctant to tell the generators well pay any price so Im not going to say well pay absolutely any price but my bias obviously is to find a way to keep the lights on Q When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought from wha t companies at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i n coming years Davis Well reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to market The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of purchasing electricity That information has to be made public That will probably be in less than two months Believe me I dont like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio n Im doing it for one reason only which is that I know every additional edg e I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers Q Theres an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe r crisis Is that right Davis The simple answer to that is no because the state will be fully reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold At the moment in the short term it is crowding out other spending But I think everyone understands thats a temporary phenomenon until the state i s reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th at I proposed Q Would it be your pledge that ratepayers not taxpayers will fully repay the states cost in purchasing electricity Davis That is the assumption underlying these bonds Thats right as it relates to electricity but obviously the conservation incentives came out of the general fund Q Have you talked to President Bush about this Davis I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesnt wa nt to be helpful but this state and particularly this region has been disproportionately helpful in Americas economic growth and technological productivity If he wants America to grow it behooves him to keep Californ ia growing To date I think its fair to say that of my public requests President Bush has been responsive to all but the price caps Davis Power surplus by Published Wednesday April in the San

including Intel Corp S un Microsystems Inc and Agilent Technologies Inc have agreed to the same arrangement as has Santa Clara University States bond rating is lowered The energy crisis brings an A designation which likely will mean higher borrowing costs April By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Californias electricity crisis prompted a top credit agency to downgrade the states credit rating by two notches to its lowest level in seven years The move is likely to force the state to pay millions of dolla rs more in interest when it borrows Its a statement from Wall Street to California to get your act together said Assemblyman George Runner RLancaster a GOP energy finance expert i n the Assembly The ratings action is serious and should be a warning to the state that it is on the wrong course added Mark McCray a municipalbonds manager at Newport Beachbased Pimco This downgrade will cost the state a lot in ter ms of increased financing and costs until if ever it is upgraded Standard and Poors Corp concerned about the billion drained from the states coffers to buy power this year cut Californias credit rating from AA to A The reduction applies to voterapproved bonds called general obligation or GO bonds that typically provide funds for schools parks water projects and highways About billion worth of GO bonds have been approved by voters About billion have not yet been sold The creditrating cut would force the state to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers to the unsold bonds If the state were to sell all billi on under the lower credit rating it could be forced to pay an additional million to million annually in interest depending on market condition s Shortly after Standard and Poors announcement state Treasurer Phil Angelides urged lawmakers to limit the size of the states looming electricitybond sale to billion or billion less than Gov Gray Davis wants Angelides said capping the revenue bond at billion would head off legal challenges from utilities expedite the passage of the bond plan through th e Legislature and allow the sale to go forward At a minimum we need an authorization of billion Angelides said If Davis and lawmakers want more they should do it later Angelides added Davis has sought billion The rift between the governor and the treasurer both Democrats marks their sharpest political divergence since the energy crisis erupted last year A Davis spokesman declined to comment on the difference We are working wi th the treasurer and others to draft legislation for that bond bill and well continue to work with him said Roger Salazar The Davis administration hopes to raise the money by selling revenue bonds backed by a charge on consumers utility bills The sale had been planned f or May but has since been pushed back to June or July at the earliest But there is a clock ticking The state has been spending million to million a day for electricity The longer the delay in selling the bonds t he less money will be available to buy cheaper energy for the state under longterm contracts Before funding future power purchases the bond proceeds must go to pay bac k the billion the state has spent on electricity purchased since January o n behalf of Californias three big cashstrapped utilities While the Standard and Poors downgrade wont directly affect the electrici ty bonds since they wont be GO bonds it does reflect Wall Streets concer n about the unstanched outflow of state funds In my mind theres no doubt that SP is doing this because they simply don t have faith in the proposed bailout and what the state is going to have to g o through to solve its power problems said Zane Mann the editor of a newsletter that tracks Californias generalobligation bonds Mann said the A rating puts California below average nationally The rating downgrade sliced the value of an existing year California GO bo nd by percent he said But since most investors who buy California bonds hold them to maturity Mann said the losses would be largely confined to paper Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek who authored the bill that authorized the power bonds said the sale should be limited to the billion originally provided for in the bill The bill provides for the utilities to forward money collected from ratepayers to the state Departmen t of Water Resources which purchases the power As the state spent more than anticipated on emergency electricity purchases Davis sought to increase the size of the bond sale But that suggestion has led the utilities to challenge the bills rate diversion mechanism which has put a cloud on our ability to acquire financing Keeley said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said he would strongly support any move to cap the amount of borrowing the state would do to buy electricity His staff said Republicans are skeptical that the ratepayers revenues are sufficient to cover the costs in the Davis administrations electricity rescue plan Nobody believes that the revenue stream is wide enough to cover all the governors energy solutions Its still being sucked up by the states utilities said Cox spokesman Jaime Fis Fis Register staff writers James B Kelleher and Diana McCabe and the Associate d Press contributed to this report Fire stokes wholesale gas cost The question is whether the retail price will climb too April By ANNE C MULKERN The Orange County Register The Tosco refinery fire may fuel rising prices on the gasoline retail marke t The spotmarket price rose cents within hours of the fire Photo Leonard Ortiz The Register Wholesale gasoline prices jumped Tuesday a day after fire erupted at Tosco Corps Carson refinery But energy experts said it is too soon to know whether the fire will drive retail gas prices higher Gas prices already are climbing because of increased demand heading into summer higher costs for additives that make cleanerburning fuel and a shi ft in marketing strategy by Tosco which wants to sell less gas at a higher price The refinery fire has the ability to worsen an already bleak situation energy experts said It doesnt take much in this market said Suzanne Garfield California Energy Commission spokeswoman Its very volatile Tosco said it will shift any lost gasoline production to its Wilmington refinery It was unclear however how long the Carson refinery would be do wn for repairs Tosco spokesman Clark Wrigley couldnt say whether the Wilmington plant could make enough gasoline to meet the companys needs in Southern California Within hours of the fire gas prices had jumped cents per gallon on the spot market a daily market where refiners sell surplus supplies That was driven mainly by speculation as those with gas to sell waited to see how high the price would go Prices later fell back to an increase of about cents from a day before Just the fact that there is a hiccup in the refinery makes everyone cringe and say Im not going to sell said Bob van der Valk manager at Cosby Oil a Santa Fe Springs gasoline wholesaler A day or so of higher spot prices probably wont affect retail costs But i f wholesale prices stay up for several days retailers will pass on those cos ts to consumers Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of California Power Virus Andersen Analysis WASHINGTONBUSINESS WIREApril via NewsEdge Corporation A new virus spawned in California poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power companies regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields a new Andersen report released today The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States Andersens national utility practice head Matthew D Smith told a Washington briefing Unfortunately California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry if not properly acknowledged and managed can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants To be effectively managed these risks need to be exposed assumed or shared measured and monitored When they are hidden or ignored all parties can potentially suffer A shared integrated view of these risks and a strategy for their assumption and management is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market Smith said An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California also released at the briefing indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny However based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in todays environment companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers customers employees and investors while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market according to Smith Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longerterm operations of the Western grid the regional and national economy domestic energy policy and the industrys evolution Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum Californias investorowned utilities have faced If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated a crucial question is raised Will state regulators passthrough higher wholesale costs if they should materialize Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed For example if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable If so these costs should be allowed into stateregulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years Therefore utilities traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators Reduced investor confidence Prior to deregulation stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable killing IOU interests in most new investment A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed but Californias political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decisionmaking will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis Contributing factor in economic softening Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can driveout marginal businesses cause healthy companies to constrain expansion and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments As such an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth Increased pressure on the Western grid Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis these solutions have longterm implications for the Western Grid These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an energy island as a result of nearterm reduction in available regional resources for export to California increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as subregions have problems RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability longerterm development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies For California investorowned utilities unbundling has achieved neither the leastcost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation transmission power trading and marketing and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions Californias retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests In addition limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy Procurement management that alters userutility negotiating leverage Competitive markets compel participants suppliers marketers large industrial buyers etc to strategically manage procurement as a critical valuedriver Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies Californias reliability and price challenges have triggered a reemergence of energy crisis measures from the s Endusers are investing in solutions they control and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers industrial users and residential customers This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability Industry Executives Response Senior executives from sixteen nonCalifornia utilities with a combined market capitalization over billion and billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry The survey conducted between February and March by Knowledge Systems amp Research Inc of Syracuse found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully expect a slowing but not a turnaround of deregulation and believe their internal plans and preparations are ontarget for the changing environment Deregulation Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation None believe that it will cause advanced states to reregulate markets although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating Californias current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it National legislation Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policylegislation others believe it will be a continuing issue but because of statetostate variances Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline Some expect additional statelevel legislation Company strategies Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California However many have expanded their risk management programs reduced spot market purchases begun emphasizing longterm supply contracts planning new power generation capacity and started hedging with futures trades Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them Investor scrutiny Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors particularly institutional investors are more heavily scrutinizing their actions Many say news coverage has prompted retail commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring Transmission deregulation Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERCs regional transmission organizations RTO deregulation effort Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust forwardthinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics or inoculations specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures controls decision points risk limits and communications are in place Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customers price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions Increase emphasis on demand side management DSM strategies In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supplydemand equilibrium companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions Companies must take a broader view beyond typical geographic market definitions of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand including for example DSM flexible pricing and distributed generation In addition they should explore efficiencyimproving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate nearterm construction plans Proactively address potential organizational disruption As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust andor restructure they must be highly cogniscent of sensitive to and directly address employees concerns with information about the companys future and theirs IndustryRegulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry nationally and internationally should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring according to Andersen principal David O Jermain Simplify market design Build a continuing role for regulators Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions Couple realtime retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition Provide special incentives for RTO investment formation and development Break down regulatory and political barriers to market

New Outage Notification System and Oncall Number FOLSOM CalifBUSINESS WIREApril via NewsEdge Corporation As the mercury climbs this week the California Independent System Operator California ISO is reminding consumers to curb their electricity use in order to minimize the strain on the power grid The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump degrees leading to a megawatt increase in electricity consumption the equivalent of two large power plants The week started out with a peak demand of megawatts but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top megawatts This comes as hydroelectricity resources both Northwest and California run low more than megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance and some megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating The California ISOs renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners For conservation tips such as using fans instead of air conditioners setting thermostat at degrees etc please see the California ISOs web site wwwcaisocom New Notification System With a challenging summer around the corner the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible For that reason a new notification system is being brought on line Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued Navigation Visit wwwcaisocom Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages will appear only when activated For previous outage information last hour etc click on Market Notices scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies Stage One Three or rotating outages If you would like to participate please email with a maximum of one email address per newsroom Additionally a single oncall media pager number has been established To make it easier on media ISO Communications will no longer be posting oncall schedules for media spokespersons on the web site Simply call the oncall pager after hours News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue as will news conferences held onsite in Folsom and via telephone As a reminder if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms in Folsom or Alhambra always call ISO Communications first at NEWS to make an appointment Access to the control rooms may be

Forwarded by Joseph AlamoNAEnron on AM Joseph Alamo AM To Miyung BusterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Power brokering Loretta Lynch has landed in the energy spotlight as the firm hand at PUCs helm April The Orange County Register Power brokering Loretta Lynch has landed in the energy spotlight as the firm hand at PUCs helm April By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO At the eye of Californias darkening electricity storm is Loretta Lynch the selfdescribed smalltown girl who became the top utility regulator in the nations largest state Her decision last week to push through a doubledigit rate increase affecting million people shocked many in the state and drew fire from powerful interests including consumer groups the public the utilities Wall Street and Gov Gray Davis The Yaletrained lawyer says she acted independently of the governor who appointed her president of the Public Utilities Commission I go my way and decide the issues based on the best evidence period Lynch said last week in a lunchtime interview in a coffee shop across the street from the Capitol All the scenarios every set of assumptions pointed to the fact that we needed to increase rates There was absolute evidence and strong analyses and we went forward Absent a rate increase she said there might not be enough revenue to back an upcoming bond issue the state desperately needs to steady the energy market As much as Davis himself the yearold Lynch is fast becoming a target for Republicans who see in Californias energy crisis an opportunity to make gains in the elections In a report to the Republicans in the Assembly veteran political consultant Sal Russo described Lynch as a formidable foe a master of damage control a hardnosed political warrior experienced in scapegoat politics Most capable in years She acknowledges shes in a political pressure cooker I accept that I deal with that I dont go to the gym as often as I used to because the days are so long but I still go and I deal with the tension I love hiking and that helps Longtime consumer advocate Michael Shames agrees Lynch is on the hot seat The president of the PUC is always a voodoo doll that people stick with pins intended to hurt other people said Shames who has been involved in utility issues in San Diego for two decades I think shes being stuck with pins right now The question is whether she can stand the pain She is probably the most capable commissioner to head the agency in years but shes got a thankless task and shes finding it a tough job Smalltown girl Scrappy and voluble Lynch proudly describes herself as a smalltown girl from Independence Mo I come from a big family an IrishCatholic family I have five sisters and the only way you went to college where I grew up was on a scholarship She says her family is tight knit and she speaks frequently by phone with her sisters including Cecelia Lynch a political science professor at the University of California Irvine A debater in high school Loretta Lynch left Independence we lived about a mile from Harry Truman and went to the University of Southern California From there she went to Yale Law School She returned to Los Angeles and worked as a lawyer at the Legal Aid Foundation which provides legal help for the poor She then served eight years as a staff attorney handling civil litigation in the San Francisco law firm of Keker Van Nest In between she found time to clerk for a federal appellate justice and work on four major political campaigns including Bill Clintons presidential race Dianne Feinsteins first US Senate bid and John Van de Kamps failed gubernatorial campaign A Democrat from a family of Democrats Lynch stayed with her roots What did she learn in the political wars Dont take anything personally and think before you speak she said She served briefly as Gov Gray Davis research and policy director and since May she has headed the PUC an enormously powerful agency with employees sweeping authority over telecommunications and electricity and a direct effect on the wallets of millions of Californians She had little or no experience in energy regulation before her appointment to the ayear job Where I come from there arent a lot of people making sixfigure salaries she notes Obscure no longer Once scarcely known the PUC is at the center of Californias electricity crisis And Lynch is at the center of the PUC The PUC was one of those little agencies with enormous power that nobody watches she said But it now faces the glare of daily media attention and the suspicion and sometimes anger of the public Its decisions are watched across the nation and a major action such as its unanimous decision to approve an asmuch as percent boost in electricity bills can rock Wall Street Lynch who is single says she tries to conserve electricity And she says she has not suffered through blackouts although several friends have I hear from them every time it happens I hear from people who want me to know theyve had a bad experience Real people experiencing real burdens and its important to remember that Davis influence Despite Davis welldeserved reputation as a micromanager and his oftrepeated statements that his appointees are there to represent his thinking Lynch avers that her actions are independent of the governor and declined to say whether she consulted him in advance Davis for his part says Lynch did not consult him before she pushed for the rate increase despite strong suspicions among Democrats and Republicans alike including many who have known Davis for years that she deliberately took the political heat for the governor Lynch believes three things led to Californias electricity crisis an earlier deregulation decision by a Republicandominated PUC a poorly drafted deregulation law and most of all outright gouging and gaming by electricity wholesalers It all comes back to those wholesalers she said As she waits to order a sandwich a woman smiles approaches and gives her hug Hang in there Loretta Hang in there the woman says suspiciously eyeing a nearby reporter with a notebook Not a problem Lynch says
