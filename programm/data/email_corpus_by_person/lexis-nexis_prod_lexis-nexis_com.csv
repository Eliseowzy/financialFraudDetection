this month they would sell the stock to the public in a step to obtain regulatory approval of their merger as a pooling of interests Such approval provides favorable tax treatment for ATT But the

deal with the NCR Corporation to settle questions about the accounting method to be used in the transaction The telecommunications giant is seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to use the poolingofinterest accounting method for the merger transaction but some aspects of the deal may not qualify for the favorable treatment The stakes are high for NCR shareholders If the pooling method is allowed AT T will use an allstock transaction to buy NCR which will be taxfree to NCR shareholders If the method is not allowed AT T will pay percent stock and percent cash with the cash portion subject to taxation Special Dividend Under the pooling method companies are generally not allowed to pay a special dividend or otherwise alter their equity capital before a merger But in

poolingofinterest treatment AT T said yesterday that NCR would withhold its next two quarterly dividends of cents each AT T also said that it would raise the price it is paying for NCR shares by cents

NCR agreed yesterday to be acquired by AT T for billion worth of AT T stock The acquisition signals the American Telephone and Telegraph Companys determination to expand beyond telecommunications to compete in computers with giants like NEC and Fujitsu of Japan Siemens of Germany and IBM In starting its quest to buy the NCR Corporation AT T was seeking a permanent solution to the problem of its moneylosing computer business and hoping to find a way to expand into new markets ones that increasingly rely on linking computers and communications Analysts say AT Ts computer business has lost more than billion in six years NCR based in Dayton Ohio grew from the National Cash Register Company it still makes some cash registers to become the fifthlargest computer maker in the country When AT T began its pursuit of NCR in December many industry observers were surprised that kindly Ma Bell had put on the grim visage of a corporate raider The hostile bid was another milestone in the transformation of the heavily regulated bureaucratic monopoly that existed before the courtordered breakup of the Bell System In recent years as a more aggressive corporation AT T has cut costs and more closely tied executive pay to profit levels Robert E Allen the chairman of AT T said yesterday that with NCR the company would work toward providing global computer networks as easy to use and accessible as the telephone network is today Jack B Grubman an analyst with Paine Webber Inc said AT T would like to be a billion company by the end of the decade They would love to be able to go to the chief executive officer of Nestle and say We will provide you soup to nuts your entire information network Given that assumption Mr Grubman and others say more large deals are likely to follow Over the next decade they will do several more deals of this size or bigger Mr Grubman said Under the definitive merger agreement AT T will exchange worth of its own stock for each NCR share but on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday NCRs shares closed at just up cents The difference reflects the fact that investors are expected to have to wait four months for the deal to close But that price is still more than double the that NCR was trading for a month before AT T made its first offer in December AT Ts shares slipped cents yesterday to AT T dwarfs NCR in size with revenues of billion compared with billion for NCR Still the computer maker will provide AT T important entries into financial and retail industries NCR is in the process of introducing a line of open system computers that are capable of being linked with computers and software made by different manufacturers The merger agreement signed yesterday is subject to the approval of NCR shareholders The First Bid It all started in December when AT T offered a share or billion for NCR By keeping AT T at bay during the winter Charles E Exley Jr NCRs chairman was able to cajole AT T into paying an additional billion He has done a lot for shareholders said Don Geogerian head of research of Dreyfus Management Inc an institutional stockholder of NCR Martin D Sass of M D Sass Investors Services said Mr Exley played his cards pretty strongly to get AT T up to In the end the booming stock market made a hero out of Mr Exley AT Ts stock was trading around in December At the time AT T said it was willing to pay for NCR with stock or cash A stock offer at that time would have involved three AT T shares for each NCR share But in April with the shares of AT T above AT T could agree to meet NCRs asking price of at minimal additional cost AT T plans to issue new stock to acquire NCR Analysts estimated that the new stock would dilute AT Ts pershare earnings by to cents a year Staying in Dayton AT T said NCR would retain its headquarters in Dayton and its corporate name Mr Allen the AT T chairman said NCR would continue to support civic and philanthropic organizations in Dayton The companies have been on the verge of an agreement for three weeks Part of the final haggling was over how much protection NCR shareholders would have if AT Ts stock price fell while the acquisition was being completed In a compromise AT T agreed to insure that NCR shareholders would receive worth of stock as long as AT T shares traded between and The exact number of AT T shares to be exchanged for each NCR share will be determined by AT Ts average closing price during the trading days before NCR shareholders meet to vote on the merger A date for the meeting has not been set but it is expected to take place in four to five months The maximum number of AT T shares exchanged for each NCR share would be if AT T stock fell to or below The minimum number would be if AT T stock was or above Analysts said it was unlikely that AT T stock would fall below without a significant overall market drop Several analysts have predicted that AT Ts stock would rise to about in the next months As an allstock deal the merger would be taxfree to NCR stockholders Some Special Accouting The allstock deal also makes it possible for AT T to use an accounting treatment known as a pooling of interests which would be favorable to its reported earnings AT T and NCR plan to talk to the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if the pooling method can be used If not AT T plans to offer percent cash and percent stock Mr Exley led the resistance to AT Ts offer initially saying NCR was worth at least a share Before NCRs March annual meeting he said he would accept Mr Exley who has more than years of experience in the computer business played an unusually active role in fending off AT T as he and his management team kept the companys Wall Street advisers on a tight leash Lets just say that they are very actively involved in deciding their own approach to things said a person working with NCR During the takeover fight NCR contended that AT T was taking advantage of a temporary drop in NCRs stock price But beyond stalling for time Mr Exley had few options after AT T made its initial bid And as time went on his options were reduced Ruling by a Judge In March a Federal judge in Dayton threw out NCRs main line of defense an employee stock ownership plan saying that it had been adopted simply to protect the incumbent management and that it made a mockery of shareholder rights At NCRs annual meeting in

Writer BODY Accountants and regulators rather than engineers and salesmen will probably determine whether ATTs purchase of NCR will be an immediate success The American Telephone Telegraph Co wants to classify its purchase of NCR Corp as a friendly stock swap eligible for treatment as a poolingofinterest merger as if the two had been operating together all along Under this method NCR shareholders wont have to pay taxes on their profits And ATT will avoid huge goodwill writeoffs which would hurt its earnings for at least years Pooling is very important to the success of the merger said Joanne C Smith an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in New York NCR doesnt cost ATT very much if they use pooling And if ATT doesnt use pooling its going to cut them back to levels of earnings that they made in The federal Securities and Exchange Commission will settle the issue balancing pressure from the companies with its skeptical view of pooling and Treasury Department concerns about millions in lost tax revenue The SEC generally prefers purchase accounting in which the buyer pays cash or securities for the acquired companys assets Analysts say the SEC likes this method because clear valuation of assets gives investors a good idea of what a company is worth If purchase accounting were used ATT would pay NCR shareholders billion percent in cash and percent in stock subject to an agreement guaranteeing NCR shareholders a minimum price Accountants would then sift through NCRs billion of assets on NCRs books and determine the fair market value of the assets which is probably higher than billion The difference between the purchase price and the market value is put on ATTs books as goodwill an intangible asset that takes into account the value added to a business as a result of reputation patronage and the like Smith estimates that a maximum billion in goodwill will have to be written off against earnings if purchase accounting is used dropping earnings by about cents per share Under pooling she said ATT will probably see earnings drop only cents a share If the merger were accounted for as a pooling of interests ATT would simply add the billion in assets on NCRs books onto its own books NCR shareholders would get billion worth of ATT stock and NCR shareholders would not have to pay taxes on the rise in their shares until the shares were sold But in its attempt to wriggle free from ATTs embrace NCR through antitakeover measures may have unwittingly prevented the use of pooling of interests Because of these moves the SEC may disqualify the deal from using poolingofinterest accounting But analyst John S Bain who works for the Raymond James securities firm in Florida said the SEC will probably allow the pooling to go through albeit reluctantly He said the SEC dislikes the antitakeover measures NCR used to fend off ATT much more than pooling Chart page C THE LONG ROAD TO A DEAL Dec ATT offers to buy NCR for ashare in stock after NCR rejected an

words HEADLINE NCRs LittleNoticed Ploy to Avoid the Clutches of ATT SERIES Occasional BYLINE ALLAN SLOAN BODY Watching NCR Corp trying to escape from ATTs hostile tender offer is like watching a guerrilla force setting booby traps to blow up in the enemys face It cant win on a conventional battlefield so it uses tricks NCRs latest corporate punji stick is a littlenoticed dividend that seems likely to reduce ATTs reported profits by billion should American Telephone Telegraph Co succeed in taking over NCR The NCR maneuver is marvelously innovative Its also incredibly sleazy given the fact that holders of twothirds of NCRs stock have tendered their shares to ATT which is offering a share and says it will go higher if NCR agrees to be bought ATT hasnt bought the tendered shares because of NCRs defenses The booby trap is a special a share dividend that NCR announced on Feb and that is scheduled to be paid tomorrow NCR says the dividend is designed to put money in the hands of its shareholders ATTs minions say confidentially that the dividends real purpose is to poison ATTs earnings statement if it buys NCR The leakers goal to get enough NCR stockholders angry enough to pressure NCRs board to cancel the dividend Why havent you heard about this dividend before Because NCR announced it the same day that it unveiled a more obvious booby trap an abusive employee stock ownership plan that ATT is challenging in court People homed in instead on the ESOP which gives NCR employees percent of NCRs voting power making it virtually impossible for ATT to get the percent majority vote it needs to oust NCRs board at a special meeting set for March Should the dividend be paid it will almost surely stop ATT from using a special accounting method called pooling of interests if it buys NCR If ATT cant use pooling its earnings will take a tremendous bath But pooling is hard to come by You must meet criteria which take pages to outline Miss one criterion and youre all wet If the dividend is paid it would be very unlikely that ATT could get pooling treatment says Robert Willens Lehman Brothers Incs resident tax and accounting expert Willenss firm isnt involved in this deal The ultimate arbiter of pooling the Securities and Exchange Commission declined comment Heres whats at stake Lets say that ATT buys NCR for billion or a share If you pool you add ATTs profits to NCRs So last year the ATTNCR combo would have earned billion ATTs billion and NCRs million If there were no pooling ATTNCR would have earned around billion less than ATT made without NCR Heres why NCRs tangible net worth the value of its plants real estate and other things you can see and touch is about billion The other billion ATT would pay is for nontangible assets like NCRs work force and its technology If ATT cant use pooling it has to charge its earnings for the billion it paid for NCRs nontangible assets Normally you get up to years to write off the nontangibles Willens estimates that because computer technology changes so rapidly ATT would have to write off the billion over no more than years That works out to million a year Even though the million charge isnt real money it requires no cash outlay and is purely an accounting item ATT will think twice before throwing million a year of profit out the window The more NCR can sabotage ATTs accounting the less ATT can offer for NCR And the greater chance NCR has of staying independent even though shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to sell This doesnt mean by the way that if ATT cant do pooling it will walk away from NCR The fact that ATT has made a cash offer you cant pool if you buy a company for cash shows that its willing to buy NCR without pooling Logic suggests however that ATT would offer more money if it can pool than it will offer if it cant I happen to believe as NCR Chairman Charles Exley Jr does that ATT will mess up NCR should its takeover attempt succeed But Exley has undermined NCRs claim to the moral high ground by saying that he would listen to a a share offer Of course his latest ploy is designed to make sure that ATT cant offer that much or anything close to it I asked NCR about the dividend trying to see if I was missing something NCRs answer read to me by a public relations person consisted of legalese The gist of it The dividend compensates NCR holders for the fact that the ATT tender offer has stopped NCR from buying its own shares on the open market There was no other reason the PR man said Right And if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you Allan Sloan

Writer BODY Accountants and regulators rather than engineers and salesmen will probably determine whether ATTs purchase of NCR will be an immediate success The American Telephone Telegraph Co wants to classify its purchase of NCR Corp as a friendly stock swap eligible for treatment as a poolingofinterest merger as if the two had been operating together all along Under this method NCR shareholders wont have to pay taxes on their profits And ATT will avoid huge goodwill writeoffs which would hurt its earnings for at least years Pooling is very important to the success of the merger said Joanne C Smith an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in New York NCR doesnt cost ATT very much if they use pooling And if ATT doesnt use pooling its going to cut them back to levels of earnings that they made in The federal Securities and Exchange Commission will settle the issue balancing pressure from the companies with its skeptical view of pooling and Treasury Department concerns about millions in lost tax revenue The SEC generally prefers purchase accounting in which the buyer pays cash or securities for the acquired companys assets Analysts say the SEC likes this method because clear valuation of assets gives investors a good idea of what a company is worth If purchase accounting were used ATT would pay NCR shareholders billion percent in cash and percent in stock subject to an agreement guaranteeing NCR shareholders a minimum price Accountants would then sift through NCRs billion of assets on NCRs books and determine the fair market value of the assets which is probably higher than billion The difference between the purchase price and the market value is put on ATTs books as goodwill an intangible asset that takes into account the value added to a business as a result of reputation patronage and the like Smith estimates that a maximum billion in goodwill will have to be written off against earnings if purchase accounting is used dropping earnings by about cents per share Under pooling she said ATT will probably see earnings drop only cents a share If the merger were accounted for as a pooling of interests ATT would simply add the billion in assets on NCRs books onto its own books NCR shareholders would get billion worth of ATT stock and NCR shareholders would not have to pay taxes on the rise in their shares until the shares were sold But in its attempt to wriggle free from ATTs embrace NCR through antitakeover measures may have unwittingly prevented the use of pooling of interests Because of these moves the SEC may disqualify the deal from using poolingofinterest accounting But analyst John S Bain who works for the Raymond James securities firm in Florida said the SEC will probably allow the pooling to go through albeit reluctantly He said the SEC dislikes the antitakeover measures NCR used to fend off ATT much more than pooling Chart page C THE LONG ROAD TO A DEAL Dec ATT offers to buy NCR for ashare in stock after NCR rejected an

words HEADLINE NCRs LittleNoticed Ploy to Avoid the Clutches of ATT SERIES Occasional BYLINE ALLAN SLOAN BODY Watching NCR Corp trying to escape from ATTs hostile tender offer is like watching a guerrilla force setting booby traps to blow up in the enemys face It cant win on a conventional battlefield so it uses tricks NCRs latest corporate punji stick is a littlenoticed dividend that seems likely to reduce ATTs reported profits by billion should American Telephone Telegraph Co succeed in taking over NCR The NCR maneuver is marvelously innovative Its also incredibly sleazy given the fact that holders of twothirds of NCRs stock have tendered their shares to ATT which is offering a share and says it will go higher if NCR agrees to be bought ATT hasnt bought the tendered shares because of NCRs defenses The booby trap is a special a share dividend that NCR announced on Feb and that is scheduled to be paid tomorrow NCR says the dividend is designed to put money in the hands of its shareholders ATTs minions say confidentially that the dividends real purpose is to poison ATTs earnings statement if it buys NCR The leakers goal to get enough NCR stockholders angry enough to pressure NCRs board to cancel the dividend Why havent you heard about this dividend before Because NCR announced it the same day that it unveiled a more obvious booby trap an abusive employee stock ownership plan that ATT is challenging in court People homed in instead on the ESOP which gives NCR employees percent of NCRs voting power making it virtually impossible for ATT to get the percent majority vote it needs to oust NCRs board at a special meeting set for March Should the dividend be paid it will almost surely stop ATT from using a special accounting method called pooling of interests if it buys NCR If ATT cant use pooling its earnings will take a tremendous bath But pooling is hard to come by You must meet criteria which take pages to outline Miss one criterion and youre all wet If the dividend is paid it would be very unlikely that ATT could get pooling treatment says Robert Willens Lehman Brothers Incs resident tax and accounting expert Willenss firm isnt involved in this deal The ultimate arbiter of pooling the Securities and Exchange Commission declined comment Heres whats at stake Lets say that ATT buys NCR for billion or a share If you pool you add ATTs profits to NCRs So last year the ATTNCR combo would have earned billion ATTs billion and NCRs million If there were no pooling ATTNCR would have earned around billion less than ATT made without NCR Heres why NCRs tangible net worth the value of its plants real estate and other things you can see and touch is about billion The other billion ATT would pay is for nontangible assets like NCRs work force and its technology If ATT cant use pooling it has to charge its earnings for the billion it paid for NCRs nontangible assets Normally you get up to years to write off the nontangibles Willens estimates that because computer technology changes so rapidly ATT would have to write off the billion over no more than years That works out to million a year Even though the million charge isnt real money it requires no cash outlay and is purely an accounting item ATT will think twice before throwing million a year of profit out the window The more NCR can sabotage ATTs accounting the less ATT can offer for NCR And the greater chance NCR has of staying independent even though shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to sell This doesnt mean by the way that if ATT cant do pooling it will walk away from NCR The fact that ATT has made a cash offer you cant pool if you buy a company for cash shows that its willing to buy NCR without pooling Logic suggests however that ATT would offer more money if it can pool than it will offer if it cant I happen to believe as NCR Chairman Charles Exley Jr does that ATT will mess up NCR should its takeover attempt succeed But Exley has undermined NCRs claim to the moral high ground by saying that he would listen to a a share offer Of course his latest ploy is designed to make sure that ATT cant offer that much or anything close to it I asked NCR about the dividend trying to see if I was missing something NCRs answer read to me by a public relations person consisted of legalese The gist of it The dividend compensates NCR holders for the fact that the ATT tender offer has stopped NCR from buying its own shares on the open market There was no other reason the PR man said Right And if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you Allan Sloan
