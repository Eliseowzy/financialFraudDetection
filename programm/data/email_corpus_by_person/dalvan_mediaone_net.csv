Christmas and a Happy New Year I think that is going to be a much better year than Heres a great article from the most recent issue of Fast Company All indicators point towards a turnaround PS I apoligize if you got this email message twice I have two email databases and they overlap Dal Coger Tsunami Partners Digital Matters Issue Most everyone has written off the dotcoms Smart investors are finding the real value by Fast Company illustrations by Jack Unruh from FC issue page Alt Text Every nine months McKinsey and Co the worlds premier management consultancy publishes an eperformance survey of more than Internet businesses around the world These dotcom companies have combined revenues of roughly billion The most recent survey published in May found that of the companies covered were profitable and that a significant number of the others were heading in that direction Dotcoms that were making money were etailers with clothing etailers doing particularly well Companies that were losing money were content sites news and sports sites were struggling the most Monika Kubicova one of four McKinsey consultants who oversee the survey told the Financial Times For etailers there is quite good reason for optimism with a reasonable number starting to show profitability Content businesses however are still playing with their business models and are in the red The McKinsey survey received virtually no press coverage because it did not fit the major medias prevailing conventional wisdom which is that the Internet sector in general and the dotcom sector in particular is as dead as smelts But as the survey makes clear for something so dead these sectors are showing all kinds of life This past July a streamlined pricelinecom announced that it had turned a secondquarter profit Google the searchengine site that is now run by former Novell wizard Eric Schmidt recently announced that it was solidly profitable EBay Travelocitycom and a host of other companies also reported strong secondquarter earnings All of these solid performances occurred in the teeth of a global economic slowdown Indeed the big largely unreported summer story of was the renewal of financial interest in all things related to the Internet Goldman Sachs and other major investment houses swarmed across Europe bottomfishing among distressed telecom and wireless properties Deal flow in Internetinfrastructure companies quickened in the United States as price points became much more realistic Even seemingly doomed content companies such as Saloncom attracted funding A couple of years from now people will look back on the summer of as the time when the music started up again Dan Burstein a managing partner of Millennium Technology Ventures LP MTVLP is one among many smart investors who see the wind shifting For almost months Burstein says MTVLP didnt see a deal that was worth the price of admission In fall MTVLP knew of one that was priced at billion By spring that exact same deal was valued at below million At billion the deal was an almost perfect metaphor for Internet insanity At below million it was a good investment MTVLP bought a stake Burstein sees the current situation as analogous to the savingsandloan crisis and the great realestate collapse of the late s to early s The SL meltdown led to writeoffs of more than billion and caused a meltdown in the realestate sector At the time there was much talk about overcapacity and glut in the realestate mark ets Today the telecom industry may have to write off anywhere from billion to trillion in bad debt And that has caused severe distress in the Internetinfrastructure world Having worked at the Blackstone Group LP prior to setting up MTVLP Burstein has good institutional memory of what a big opportunity looks like Under the direction of former commerce secretary Pete Peterson Blackstone surveyed the wreckage of the SLrealestate crisis and decided to establish a separate entity to get in on the action even though Blackstone had no prior experience in realestate investing The company ended up buying packets of properties and when the market revived in the latter half of the s Blackstone sold them off at a staggering profit Burstein thinks that the telecom and Internet shakeout of the past two years is an investing opportunity of similar size and scope Consider the prevailing wisdom that there is a bandwidth glut You can read a thousand research reports on the Internet and invariably you will find someone whining about this glut It is certainly true that the information superhighways running down the fiberoptic lines between major metropolitan areas are for the moment underutilized But does that mean that they will be underutilized in five or seven years The likely answer to that question Of course not Pervasive computing means that new appliances new security systems new HVAC installations in buildings whether commercial or residential will communicate with server farms to exchange information constantly Peertopeer technology will have computers talking back and forth to one another constantly updating information for millions of end users Gaming will continue to grow and become for the echoboom generation what television was for the baby boomers All of these technologies will be added to an evergrowing traffic flow of email messaging searches and business communications Enabling all of this technology will require enormous amounts of bandwidth and gargantuan amounts of what George Gilder calls storewidth the response time between entering a request on the Web and getting back the first page Bandwidth and storewidth companies have been hammered over the course of the past months to the point where they are now selling at relatively reasonable prices Like the realestate glut of the late s the bandwidth glut of the early s is almost certainly a temporary phenomenon So its not surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside looking at Internetinfrastructure companies that will enable the coming of all of these new technologies It will take a number of years before we know which investors made the right bets The secret of business success is that much of it derives from luck and timing But after months of virtually no activity with huge pools of investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts the great game has quietly restarted Investment companies are back at the table placing their bets And the biggest bets are being wagered in the beleaguered telecom sector which makes sense European telecoms in particular overpaid for spectrum licenses and in doing so jeopardized their franchises Now they must sell off key assets to stay afloat Those assets are selling at a significant discount Situations like that attract big money very fast The next wave will occur in the Internetinfrastructure sector as companies with strong market positions but weak cash flow hit the wall and grow desperate The last wave will be in a whole range of dotcom companies especially shopping bots As peertopeer computing advances shopping bots will not only be able to find you the best price on any given item but they will also give you the ability to auction out your business Kids need backtoschool clothes Bid your business out on the Internet and the Gap will have to offer you worth of merchandise for If it doesnt Target will Ever since April the question has been When is this thing the Internet business for lack of a better phrase going to turn around The answer is in that McKinsey survey and in the behavior of some of the worlds leading investors Its turning around now If the SLrealestate crisis is a suitable analogy itll take about five years to get from here to there Along the way theres lots of money to be made John Ellis is a writer and consultant based in New York Dal Coger Tsunami Partners Executive Search Selection Ph Ph Cell Fax wireless email
