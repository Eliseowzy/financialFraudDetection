<5181871.1075846346672.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,stacy.walker@enron.com,2000-01-13 05:53:00,Resource allocation working group I printed this put it in your working group file mm Teamattached are my groups top objectives at the headquarters level and at the incountry level for the international PR marketing communication and social responsibility areas How we prioritize We arrive at these objectives after discussion with heads of the business units and senior management and we focus on goals that support the priority business goals of the company and buildprotect the reputation of the company as a whole On a quarterly basis at least we review these top objectives and ensure that we are staying on target Internationally we are faced with numerous issues and crises which must be dealt with and they also take on a priority spot when they occur There is an issue with prioritization that we must constantly deal with Some of our clients are PR savvy and wish to use our services which should please us except that sometimes small low priority and visibility projects use too much of our time that should be spent elsewhere Conversely we sometimes have important projects that the developer wishes to keep low budget and we are not allowed to have the level of input that we should How human and financial resources are allocated The bulk of our human resources currently are allocated to the regions and the structure is an area in transition since the reorganization and in light of several open positions that we have We determine in conjunction with the business units the proper number and level of staff The regional PR head determines how his or her junior people are assigned At the headquarters level we focus on the activities that benefit the company overall as well as top priority countries Marketing communication maintains adequate staff to meet customer demands and adds temporary staff during peak periods We all work on the highest priority items for the year but also tend to focus on issues of the moment that are of greatest significance to the business unit leaders My goal is to keep people focused on the longterm objectives for the year and not get caught up in the day to day operations without this long term focus If there is an area I would like to further refine it is making sure that we are better deploying our human resources on what is important How financial resources are allocated We have a PR budget for each operating company for international headquarters for marketing services and for sustainable development At the regional level figures are projected for each country andor project and these are discussed with the various country leaders Headquarters budget is used for activities that benefit all areas and not one region or country Marketing communication budget is on a billback basis the most difficult to predict because it is comprised of costs for developing presentations and other marketingsales tools This has been a trait of the former EI and is the expectation of developersif you need it for marketing purposes you do it As you will note in my objectives I would like this department to arrange a billing system including their time and fixed costs that allows them to be completely selfsupporting rather than allocating across business units This will encourage people to use their services more wisely When a new project is being pursued budgets are approved for all aspects of the project including PR employee communication and social responsibility The social responsibility budgets typically fall short or are nonexistent and this is another area that we will be focusing on changing this year How this fits with budgeting process Our allocation of resources is linked directly with our budgeting process There are two exceptions pursuing major projects that were not planned at the beginning of the year Budgets for these new pursuits are approved during the overall project approval process and again we must work to have greater input in this process costs for resolving major crises such as Cuiaba and Human Rights Watch have been significant and were not prebudgeted
