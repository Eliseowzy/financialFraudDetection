clipping service targeted at California politicos and policy wonks It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer comments a couple days ago Today it has the NY Times article on Ken Lay Its pretty clear that in the nearterm Enron and its leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm which bounces from coast to coast gaining strength each step of the way However it is the longterm challenge that draws my attention From my research to date I am left with the strong impression that the Enrons capacity for acquiring distilling and assessing business information is much stronger than its abilities with public policy information Ken Lay you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge Like Goldman Sachs it is hard for the man on the street to understand precisely what Enron does However because of your presence in businesses that play out daily in homes schools and small businesses Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldnt imagine in its worst nightmares From my perspective the success of Enrons business model demands a sure footing in both business and public policy Going forward these two areas of expertise need become intertwined to assure the success of the highly sophisticated ethical innovative and insightful global corporation known as Enron I would like to help

warnings a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business and consumer disruptions Gov Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a threetier blackout warning system Forecasts of

Democratic Gov Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job approval rating and image among state residents according to a Field Poll released yesterday For the first time since his November election more Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis performance than favorable Carla Marinucci in the San Francisco Chronicle Hallye Jordan in the San Jose Mercury John Marelius in the San Diego Union Poll puts Riordan Davis in tight race Californians assessment of Gov Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state energy crisis placing outgoing Los Angeles

baseline rates Nine days after structuring the largest electricity rate increase in California history state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay If the indicators are revised upward as most expect that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles Times Michael Bazeley in the San Jose Mercury Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento Bee Enron Bush Curtis Hbert Jr Washingtons top electricity regulator said he had barely settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L Lay the head of the nations largest electricity trader

deregulation Enron would continue to support him in his new job Lowell Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in depths of poll

officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much lower than in the past Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their customers to rolling blackouts the muni

blackouts officials said afterward Jim Miller in the Modesto Bee Edison merit raises Southern California Edison which is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy will hand out million in merit raises to its employees today but top executives will forgo the raises because of the companys financial woes Edison has doled out hefty merit raises in the past But this year the company will pay the minimum under its variable compensation program which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals Kate Berry in the Orange County Register Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts More than California cities that have municipal utilities including Anaheim are asking federal regulators to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the states Independent System Operator The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in Californias rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas Vernons utility argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had enough power to keep the lights on Amy Strahan Butler in the Orange County Register Utility tax windfall As electricity rates rise consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years A member of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls from the utility user tax and he is backing a grassroots movement to slash or repeal it Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money saying that they need it to pay their own higher energy bills Wendy Thermos in the Los Angeles Times An air of discontent over diesel backups Gov Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts And when blackouts do occur thousands of tractortrailersize generators will whir to life powering elevators and lights hospital equipment even assembly lines But that prospect has created major concerns Most of those industrial strength generators run on diesel oil a highly polluting fuel

Carolyn Said in the San Francisco Chronicle Power price controls The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans

beleaguered system out of the red this time The heat wave didnt hit all areas of the state at the same time and cooler weather in the Pacific Northwest got power flowing from that region to California

Enrons secret bid to save deregulation PRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias energy crisis His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the states energy mess PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California Theyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists One of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased percent to billion Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the meeting DC CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the allegation Also in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds first civilian space trip Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue His intent is to listen to all sides Attached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda Email the writers at and Scott Winokur at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

generators of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if necessary Then he really got angry calling the m the biggest snakes in the world This past week Atty Gen Bill Locky er boosted the rhetoric a notch by declaring he would like to personally e scort the chairman of Enron Corp to an by cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey

conservation programs Its been fun No w its time for our leaders to act like adults Davis and Bush alwa ys will have their political differences but the economies of both the st ate and the nation are endangered by Californias energy situation These leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible starting next week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president Da vis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California v isit Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to dis cussing energy and other issues Good start Lets hope the conversation i s civil and that the civility spreads No matter how much California has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric power generation this year and next Usually the biggest targets of offi cial and public wrath are the investorowned utilities such as Southern Ca lifornia Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co But not this time because in the view of the state the utilities have been bled dry by the power ge nerators stratospheric prices The state had to take over the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and PGE Legal recourse should be pursued but the threatening rhetoric need s to subside State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholes ale price controls And Davis is justifiably upset with Bush and with Chen ey who said the only solution was to build more power plantsignoring th e fact that the state is building plants now with five more on the way and that the only way to control wholesale power rates is for Washington to cap them If the state hadnt bought the power the generators w ould have let the lights go out Davis needs to deliver that message quie tly and persuasively while Bush is in California And Bush needs to liste n

Californians Until now The Verm ont senators widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday The change which Jeffords is expected to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis tration to respond more aggressively to Californias electricity crisis t hese insiders said And it might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week In f act the administrations proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords decision At th e very least Senate observers said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif is l ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale electricity That doesnt necessarily mean that the administration s critics will be able to have everything their way Even if the Senate ap proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o pposition in the GOPdominated Houseand a likely veto if it made it to t he presidents desk Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol icy It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh o requested anonymity Observed Sen John F Kerry DMass If P resident Bushs hardedged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl ications not just for California but for the environment and our nations energy policy Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont emplated the possible impact of Jeffords decision on the policies they ca re about All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park or that the administrations desire to promote nuclear power will be emb raced by Congress On the other hand it seems more probable that C ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N evada to protect the regions oldest trees consider legislation to restri ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling Its stunning how broad t he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst one of the Natural Resources Defense Council Were trying not to count o ur chickens before they hatch But it will be easier for us in our battles at least to keep from moving backwards For instance Jeffords is a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants And if events play out as expected hell become the new chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue Another i ssue under his purview would be the twodecade dispute over a proposed rep ository for the nations spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W ilderness Society Environmentalists had been worried that a number of prodevelopment provisions would be packed into appropriation bills B ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat they said Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev el of scrutiny Francis said The biggest change would be the power of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o n a number of issues considered important to the state That transl ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis I think it mean s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said Right now the pres ident doesnt seem to give a darn Theyre all looking at California as a Democratic state Theyre not interested Feinstein who has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to the administration She has been regarded as a bridgebuilder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past This has not been a warm and friendly administration she complained Wednesday Theyve got peopl e who know all the answers and dont want to listen The White Hou se disputed that In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the presidents first visit to California next week Under a Democ ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees the military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se nate Judiciary Committee Boxer would be in line to chair the subco mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism Mav iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords expected party defection wou ld be felt immediately The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H Murkowski R Alaska who has been openly hostile to Californias plight and handed to Jeff Bingaman DNM who supports Davis request for electricity pri ce controls according to Maviglio Democrats have assailed Bushs e nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side With Democrats

chairman of a Houstonbased power company should be locked in a prison cel l with an amorous tattooed inmate named Spike Lockyer who is inve stigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale el ectricity market made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Jo urnal that appeared Tuesday I would love to personally escort En ron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an by cell that he could share wit h a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Lockyer said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment counterproductive rh etoric that does not merit a response But other industry repres entatives denounced the remark as outrageous especially because neither Lockyers office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against En ron or other companies Youd expect that the states chief legal c ounsel would file charges first and make public statements second said G ary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum an association of energy producers and traders Were very disappointed with his choice of words which dont exactly fit the profile of his office In an interview Tuesday Lockyer said he decided to ratchet up the commentary to put e nergy companies on notice that we are not afraid of them and have the w ill to prosecute What Im trying to do is let these economic buc caneers understand that if we catch them theyre going to be prosecuted Lockyer said Just because theyre multimillionaires and run big corpora tions it doesnt provide them with immunity The attorney general is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market S everal panels including a state Senate committee and the California Publi c Utilities Commission are conducting similar probes On Tuesday L ockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over docum ents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators The attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a Mar ch deadline to hand them over Lockyer said the forthcoming docu ments would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in s earch of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity Lockyer said But we need to make sure its compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury Lockyer said he singled out Enrons chairman because the Houston company is the worlds largest energy trader At least one observer found Lockyers comments refreshingly

and Exch ange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether energy con sultants advising Gov Gray Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday The federal agency began its review late last week the source said in response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones A Republican rival of Davis Jones charged that stock trading by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on information not available to the public On Friday top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their personal finances As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital M onday Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration owns energy stocks Financial disclosure records fi led by the governors spokesman Steve Maviglio show that he owns between and in a Texas company he and his boss have accused of m aking obscene profits while California has been on its knees Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houstonbased Enron Corp in Its no t a crime to own energy stock Maviglio said He also owns shares of San Josebased Calpine Corp which has the largest share of the bill ion in longterm state power contracts Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May one day after San Joses mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by the governor and others Under t he terms of Maviglios purchase the transaction was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached a share a value of It ha s since fallen in value I viewed it as a good longterm investment M aviglio said adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement accou nt based on publicly available information The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers such as Enron But Californias grid operator has i dentified the company as one of many energy merchants to overcharge the st ate millions of dollars The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpi ne ranging in value from several thousand dollars to more than records show Another top Davis administration official legal affairs s ecretary Barry Goode disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held between and million in another outofstate com pany accused of multimilliondollar price gouging In a statement Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Cos a month after he began working fo r the governor in February Goode said the shares were supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed to do so In light of the recent disclosures Secretary of State Jones said the governo r must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first The g overnor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflic t of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any activity si nce their last statement of economic interest was filed said Jones who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor Word of the SECs entry into Californias energy problems comes as the governor faces harsh criticism f rom lawmakers and others for the quick and broad hiring of highly paid pri vate consultants to guide him through the crisis In his written request to the SEC Jones said that recently filed disclosure documents showed tha t at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies w ithin the same month raising a red flag about the possibility of inside r trading State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests The five consultants fired last week were among named in Jones letter delivered to the San Fran cisco office of the SEC last Wednesday It was not clear which individuals are the focus of the SECs inquiry or whether the agencys review would result in any charges Two of the former traders said Monday that they ha d not been contacted by federal investigators and knew nothing of an inqui ry into possible insider trading But William Mead fired Thursday said it is no mystery why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock Mead said he bought it years ago and made so much money he recommended it to his colleagues last year while they all still worked for the nowdefu nct California Power Exchange in Alhambra Calpine power was not traded on that exchange so there was no conflict of interest he said Mead and three other energy tradershired by the state in February and Marchwere terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power for the state from Calpine while owning the companys stock Fired traders Herman Leung Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their C alpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be fil ed only two weeks ago But Im sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange because thats when we discussed it Mead said It was kind of like a hobby Im sure it wasnt done with the intent to ma nipulate Former trader Elaine Griffin who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two weeks ago to take another job said she didnt know she owne d energy securities until she checked with her financial advisor July just before leaving her state job Griffin said she and her husband own a bout worth of Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts mana ged by their advisor who bought the stock Feb without their knowledge she said after research found it to be a good investment I kind of fe el like weve been used for political reasons Griffin said We would ha ve disclosed anything right at first but they never asked As a trader Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state but on ly at market prices Meanwhile two Democratic political consultants who helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet have agreed to accept no payment for their work a s part of an outofcourt settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit Tom Hiltachk a lawyer for conservative antitax activist Lewis Uhler said the settlem ent was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for communicat ions consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane Now they will not receiv e one red cent said Hiltachk Very simply Mr Fabiani and Mr Lehane ha ve agreed to cease all activities for the governor to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the consulting business wit h the governor As his part of the agreement Hiltachk said Uhler with drew his lawsuit Monday morning Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the tw o consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because of a conflict of interest The tw o men also did consulting work for financially

our leaders go at suppliers a nd each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests In his St ate of the State address last January Gov Gray Davis accused the big pri vate electric power generators of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if necessary Then he really got angry calling the m the biggest snakes in the world This past week Atty Gen Bill Locky er boosted the rhetoric a notch by declaring he would like to personally e scort the chairman of Enron Corp to an by cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Meanwhile President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for c ausing its own problems with a harebrained deregulation scheme and mocke d the states power purchases and conservation programs Its been fun No w its time for our leaders to act like adults Davis and Bush alwa ys will have their political differences but the economies of both the st ate and the nation are endangered by Californias energy situation These leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible starting next week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president Da vis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California v isit Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to dis cussing energy and other issues Good start Lets hope the conversation i s civil and that the civility spreads No matter how much California has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric power generation this year and next Usually the biggest targets of offi cial and public wrath are the investorowned utilities such as Southern Ca lifornia Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Co But not this time because in the view of the state the utilities have been bled dry by the power ge nerators stratospheric prices The state had to take over the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and PGE Legal recourse should be pursued but the threatening rhetoric need s to subside State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholes ale price controls And Davis is justifiably upset with Bush and with Chen ey who said the only solution was to build more power plantsignoring th e fact that the state is building plants now with five more on the way and that the only way to control wholesale power rates is for Washington to cap them If the state hadnt bought the power the generators w ould have let the lights go out Davis needs to deliver that message quie tly and persuasively while Bush is in California And Bush needs to liste n

Enrons secret bid to save deregulation PRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias energy crisis His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the states energy mess PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California Theyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists One of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased percent to billion Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the meeting DC CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the allegation Also in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds first civilian space trip Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue His intent is to listen to all sides Attached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda Email the writers at and Scott Winokur at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

clipping service targeted at California politicos and policy wonks It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer comments a couple days ago Today it has the NY Times article on Ken Lay Its pretty clear that in the nearterm Enron and its leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm which bounces from coast to coast gaining strength each step of the way However it is the longterm challenge that draws my attention From my research to date I am left with the strong impression that the Enrons capacity for acquiring distilling and assessing business information is much stronger than its abilities with public policy information Ken Lay you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge Like Goldman Sachs it is hard for the man on the street to understand precisely what Enron does However because of your presence in businesses that play out daily in homes schools and small businesses Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldnt imagine in its worst nightmares From my perspective the success of Enrons business model demands a sure footing in both business and public policy Going forward these two areas of expertise need become intertwined to assure the success of the highly sophisticated ethical innovative and insightful global corporation known as Enron I would like to help

Lockyer Fires Earthy Attack at Energy Exec By JENIFER WARREN Ti mes Staff Writer SACRAMENTOIn a dramatic escalation of energy cr isis rhetoric California Atty Gen Bill Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houstonbased power company should be locked in a prison cel l with an amorous tattooed inmate named Spike Lockyer who is inve stigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale el ectricity market made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Jo urnal that appeared Tuesday I would love to personally escort En ron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an by cell that he could share wit h a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Lockyer said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment counterproductive rh etoric that does not merit a response But other industry repres entatives denounced the remark as outrageous especially because neither Lockyers office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against En ron or other companies Youd expect that the states chief legal c ounsel would file charges first and make public statements second said G ary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum an association of energy producers and traders Were very disappointed with his choice of words which dont exactly fit the profile of his office In an interview Tuesday Lockyer said he decided to ratchet up the commentary to put e nergy companies on notice that we are not afraid of them and have the w ill to prosecute What Im trying to do is let these economic buc caneers understand that if we catch them theyre going to be prosecuted Lockyer said Just because theyre multimillionaires and run big corpora tions it doesnt provide them with immunity The attorney general is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market S everal panels including a state Senate committee and the California Publi c Utilities Commission are conducting similar probes On Tuesday L ockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over docum ents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators The attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a Mar ch deadline to hand them over Lockyer said the forthcoming docu ments would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in s earch of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity Lockyer said But we need to make sure its compelling and clear enough

truly do believe that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer will prove more effective for Enron than delayed or intermediated action As we discussed if I can be of any help with reconnaissance or

IMAGEPrint this story IMAGE IMAGE Shift May Empower California By RICHARD SI MON ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers WASHINGTONJames M J effords has never mattered much to Californians Until now The Verm ont senators widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday The change which Jeffords is expected to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis tration to respond more aggressively to Californias electricity crisis t hese insiders said And it might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week In f act the administrations proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords decision At th e very least Senate observers said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif is l ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale electricity That doesnt necessarily mean that the administration s critics will be able to have everything their way Even if the Senate ap proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o pposition in the GOPdominated Houseand a likely veto if it made it to t he presidents desk Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol icy It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh o requested anonymity Observed Sen John F Kerry DMass If P resident Bushs hardedged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl ications not just for California but for the environment and our nations energy policy Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont emplated the possible impact of Jeffords decision on the policies they ca re about All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park or that the administrations desire to promote nuclear power will be emb raced by Congress On the other hand it seems more probable that C ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N evada to protect the regions oldest trees consider legislation to restri ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling Its stunning how broad t he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst one of the Natural Resources Defense Council Were trying not to count o ur chickens before they hatch But it will be easier for us in our battles at least to keep from moving backwards For instance Jeffords is a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants And if events play out as expected hell become the new chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue Another i ssue under his purview would be the twodecade dispute over a proposed rep ository for the nations spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W ilderness Society Environmentalists had been worried that a number of prodevelopment provisions would be packed into appropriation bills B ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat they said Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev el of scrutiny Francis said The biggest change would be the power of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o n a number of issues considered important to the state That transl ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis I think it mean s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said Right now the pres ident doesnt seem to give a darn Theyre all looking at California as a Democratic state Theyre not interested Feinstein who has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to the administration She has been regarded as a bridgebuilder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past This has not been a warm and friendly administration she complained Wednesday Theyve got peopl e who know all the answers and dont want to listen The White Hou se disputed that In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the presidents first visit to California next week Under a Democ ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees the military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se nate Judiciary Committee Boxer would be in line to chair the subco mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism Mav iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords expected party defection wou ld be felt immediately The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H Murkowski R Alaska who has been openly hostile to Californias plight and handed to Jeff Bingaman DNM who supports Davis request for electricity pri ce controls according to Maviglio Democrats have assailed Bushs e nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side With Democrats in c harge of the Senate the administration would be more likely to compromise perhaps beefing up funding for Democratsupported causes such as increas ed energy assistance to lowincome households and more aggressive promotio n of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar powe r Search the archives of the Los Angeles Times for similar stories ab out United States Politics Republican Party James M Jeffords P olitical
